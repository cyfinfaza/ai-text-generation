okay calm down
cy stop shaming samuel
you have to realize
we've already established this
it is nearly impossible
like 3080 impossible
to get a 5900x rn
3080 actually isnt impossible now
im just slow as balls
yeah yeah
OOF
and?
and?????
and blank
bruh
STOP
lora
i like lora

F Zotac website crashed again
F
F

error 524
F
i can add it to cart
yeah same
hope it works
nope
out of stock now
F
oos
F
F
F
god damn it
again
amazon/newegg are better
since they dont crash
nono its cuz i didnt add payment information
and it defaulted to paypal
"i told you so"
lol
I CANT CHANGE IT WTF
HOW DO YOU CHANGE PAYMENT METHOD
ask the server tbh
ramesh aint really trying for much
the next crazy thing im going to pull is in february probably with the 6000 series
6700xt probably
make sure you figure out how to do it for 
* amazon
* antonline
* newegg
* bestbuy
* asus
* zotac (insert zotac meme)

<I can't think of any other retailers>
just like check em all off
zotac is paypal only
it wont happen again if youre ready
bruh
ur kidding
yeah its wack af
newegg
I can help you on newegg
i did it there already
i already did newegg
thats why i wrote newegg
as a checklist thing
hmm amazon
u say 17th
ups say somethging else
lol cool
BB
yes
im not doing antonline or asus or zotac
newegg is worst imo
lol
is antonline too sketch for u
it still has cards tho
yeah antonline is SKETCH AS
where
did they FUD into thinking antonline is sketch
nono
people are actually getting stuff
it was my own opinion
lol
it just looks a bit sketch
it was sketchy but honestly I would do it
it feels less skethcy after seeing people having success there
nahnah
plus neither of my parents know of it
sooooo
LMAO
my dad heard of it after he looked ryzen 5000
so
lmao
there a chance it comes tomorrow?
maybe idk
wouldnt count on it tho
yeah idc i wont have anything ready tomorrow
i have to use
this brand psu
to test my stuff
sentey is very sketchy
errr
i can buy it
im this close to buying a kraken x52
should I do it
X53 or 52
53 okay
Depends on ur case
And if the look fits it
x53 is newer
idk about those thermaltake fans tho
they are really cheap though
i donnit
i bought a kraken x53
is the ryzen 9 3900x a bad idea?
its $400 at microcenter
yes
how so
5800x has higher single core
better for gaming
the 3900x gets 213 fps, the 5800x gets 373
oh thats true
aaand 5600x drop happened
couldnt add to cart
like
did you buy now
or add to cart
the button just wouldnt work
both
F
would you have settled for it if you had gotten it
oh yeah
for sure
apparently amazon is drop shipping cpus from amd or something
honestly try snail monitor
it might be faster
again I can help you get full acecss to snail
im legitimately worried this will happen to me concerning my 5900x since it is so high demand
i was the first F
lol
ahhhhhh
do you have your aio already
Nag
Nah
well we'll see how good this kraken is
also I investigated temp issues
that's for the kraken aio software which is pointless for me
is that urs?
if so pog
no
u think
i got a 3080
lmao
OO UPS MOVING
i love how it starts on 11/11/2020 like ups doesn't know what thy're doing
NICE
it's gonna happen soon
my cooler also shipped lol
4 hour drive
from VA to NJ
LOL no
this is strange tho
amazon also shipped my coolers via ups
nevermind 7 hours
i put in somerset
but it defaulted to somerset maryland
lol
ughh do you know how bad the bottleneck will be
5900x rx580
what tasks?
gaming?
a lot
yeah exactly
otherwise not much
and im not getting a 3080
rip
rx 6800xt?
6700 in february probs
ohhhh
should be nice hopefully
yeah like the 6900xt will probably go oos in 2 seconds
same with 6800xt
you know apparently it took 6 months to get regular 3950x or 3900x stock
WTH is this screenshot
$1000
no
look at the SCREENSHOT
just get an intel at that point
yeye
how tf does he buy
a 5900x
ye ik
i feel like it's inspect elemented
could be
people are bad like this smh
Did you get that zotac drop
no cuz paypal
Im assuming you didnt try the 5950x drop yeh
Since
Monies
i dont need 16 god damn cores
$800
a bit too much for me
how much is it supposed to be
$800
uhhh
msrp is $700 for rtx 3080
how much are the cheaper 3080s
oh
ah i see
F
so how gosh darn incredibly lucky am I

rgb decrease temps by 10 degress
if i search "bruh" in my chat with cdknight i get no results
this is interesting
out of 19k messages to me
ramesh has not said "bruh" once
and in
what is it
like
600 messages with sam
twice
that would be like
infinite times more
which is interesting\
because
Bruh
it shows how ramesh speaks differently
with different ppl
bruh
yes
see
I bet cy doesn't know what "F" means either
or am I mistaken
ah i see more zotac drops
oo cool u will get it this afternoon
I just took my drivers permit test
During compsci club
yes
and then
well
actually
it will probably come around 16:00
I am going to show it to Samuel L Jackson
for you
yes
but csc still happens during 1600
wait
yeah it does
um
for u and khiller
isn't it 14:30-15:30
ah yes
indeed
and like perhaps samuel L jackson
but you see
i hvae a calc test

i just like
"noooooooooo"
i see
and I say hhhh to laugh

hhhh
hhhhhhhhhhhhh
tbh idrc about the latest ryzen

okay akhil but
ew
stock cooler
the dust
look at the dust
you can still buy a 5900x
but
why must my life exist
No
it's 50 dollars more
does he do it
or does he not go broke
Fucking scalpers should suck shrek’s massive schlong
mak
ikr
mác
haha
hhahahahh
but like
THEY SHOULD
it's not even that _bad_ of a scalp
ACTUAL DEVILS
STILL THO
it's enticing enough
Scalping is scalping
that they will actually get people to buy it
but
but
ramesh you should have sold urs
why
or at least tried to
my computer was killing itself
to make money
and then buy another one
it crashed
every day
because
linux
there was too much dust
and it overheated
At least ur pc had more than 4 cores and 1.58 ghz
1.58
I hope you know this is not even funny in this context
Like this has absolutely nothing to do with my operating system of choice
“I use Arch btw”
btw
good
btw
btw
no əkil uses mak
vəkil
i also use arch
no he doesnt
i use arch
just not primary
ok send me your neofetch
let's see it huh
I use w10
i gotta start up the vm
samuəl dean
if you get a radeon
you should get linux
radeon gaming performance is better in minecraft on linux
like
way bettert
sure
aw
its gone bye bye
did it expire
i suppose it did
But I’m not solely playing Minecraft tho
what games do you play
Variety
like list
The thing is
i can tell you if it will work on linux
whether or not
you want to switch
There are a lot of games I can’t play
But I would with a better pc
List:
among us
Crusader kings 2 and 3
COD
Minecraft
which one?
Warzone
Cold War
nice
well
wait aint that the new one?
Ye
I already have war zone
oh its already gona gold?
damn
But I can’t even get past the main menu
Cuz pc is actual dogshit
Yea thats expected
Like
My mom says
heck COD doesnt even work on my xbox
other than call of duty which idk since it's too new
LMAO
it all works
and idk what warzone is
is it another cod?
Ye
battle royal cod
Last year’s
yea
Bro i swear Cyberpunks gonna come out in 2077
ah fun
anticheat prevents it from working on linux
but the other ones do
wait what
nvm i am seeing conflicting reports online
probably works for some, not for others
anti cheats weird
it works for most games except the ones with anti cheat
Halo?
which one
it has good reports on protondb
idk any
master chief
this one obv
halo beats!
no
well it does work
cuphead?
nice
AC?
assassin's creed is my guess
Assassins Creed

Nah
I want to
Maybe cp tho
but my xbox is dying
it seems good
Just get a new pc or Xbox series x them 😳😳😳😳😳
i will
next year
F
i can wait a while
or
get a 5900x
I would
i would need a gpu
But i don’t really need that much horsepower
neither do I
but it was in stock SOOOOOO
I need 8 cores
And I could get away with 6
so i7?
As long as they’re fast
some tasty overheating to go with your 8 cores?
intel
is garbage
R7
dont even mention them
ah r7
they're not even like
close
eh im fine with my i7
it hasnt failed me yet
he's gonna buy another mcbook
nah, new macs dont have intel remember
M1 chip
i havent even see benchmarks of the chip yet
remember I don't care about apple?
yes ik
but ARM cool
They actually look promising this year
I’m kinda rooting for them tbh
Just to shake up the laptop and maybe even the pc market
I hope nvidia screws them over by somehow revoking their arm license
Fuck Apple
Yes
Khill
Stop
No spoils
I forgot
That
It had a spoiler
I didnt read it
So we r good
Ok thank god
Akhil WHERE ARE YOU IN THE BOOK

Or the purpose of the bot
HAHA
I'm legitimately scared

since that story is just so
Samuel will come in and say he got it
gone now obv
Watch
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
nice one
Do I really need an r9 tho?
yes
ill tell you why
Yes
that is legitimately the only reason why
Now?
no like it was in stock
I would have bought it
The thing is
I don’t at all need it
you could sell it later
but at least it'll get you up and running
also the 5900X is a pretty big jump from a 5800X
I j need an r5 and an rx6800xt
idk id go r7
but that went out of stock
like my status
Bruh
what I'm saying is just buy it no matter what you need
it's not worth waiting imo
Discord overlay
That gta?
Take another guess
No
COD?
Yep
Which one?
Cold war
slitherio?
nvm
Nah
Thats warzone?
BRO I CANT EVEN RUN EITHRR OF THOSE
Haha

Hmm cod black ops 3?
and preorder it on bh
if you do it in the first 10 seconds
NO
stop hating on bh

Before that
I was answering Akhil
Lmao
Lmao
Bruh what COD can u run?
Sams gonna get himself a 3080
Good luck
sam is a girl's name
I mean it could be used for both
And also samuel knows that, thats why he occasionally calls himself Samantha in kahoots
If I remember correctly
tell samuel to get ready
it's dropping in 9 minutes
should i be really mean
and troll the discord
If ur gonna get one, 9 min
If u want
"while you guys freak out about tigerdirect, im chilling here with my 5900x build"
Oh i was gonna say
U could divert them
Say it appeared on a dif site
That way we can help Samwell to glory
should I do it
id probs get banned
Yea dont
Wait so what is dropping and where?
zotac
is dropping
rtx
cards
in a few minutes
4 minutes it seems
On their website?
I don’t have PayPal
uh
get one
so you might be able to buy stuff without actually making an acc
okay
it's in stock
nvm
haha lol
AAaaand the website is down.
this is funny since it didn't actually drop anything
ZOTAC DROPPED?
it's a troll
nice server
if someone ever wants it
you can download it fof ree
um
it only works if u have a sabrent drive
Oh
Oops
i used that
cuz i have a sabrent drive
its like
a degraded acronis
that checks if ur drive is sabrent
and if it isnt
doesnt work
it only gives you like the cloning feature and a few others not all of them
haha
zotac went in stock
this is irony
amp holo still in stock
samuel if you want it i still had it here
that probs won't work
or is trying?
it's so ugly no one will buy it so you can
SAMUEL BUY IT ALREADY
DAMN IT
Did it go out of stock?
no
can you buy it for him?
nope
im reading words of radiance rn
nice
I would have bought it
pretty sure u can
But it literally said unavailable when i went on the website
oof
yeah i cannot find it on amazon
a 5800x
Yeah they’re all unlisted
You have to get links
they notified on snail monitor
if you want
i can refer you
so you can get amazon access
bruh snail monitor is god tier
you gotta pay
or get referred
ill help with referals
yeah
i will leave and rejoin
Nah I’m getting an athlon anyway

so i trust them more
Atr was good for gpus though
yeh
i have both
but im telling you get snail
sometimes atr reports
sometimes it's only snail
how do i make a refer link?
just
right click and click "invite people"
yeah
but i want samuel to get it
since he has been trying at this far longer than you
yea
then ill do you
im doing for xbox and stuf
samuel is already in the server tho
create a refer link
we shall do the rest
tell him to create one

whaddaya want me to do
join
"Join, or die"
and...
then what
nothing
that's it
k
if you can
send that EXACT invite link
to some other people
and get them to join
why do ppl need to join tho
akhil
can you explain
essentially
to get the cool bot
that notifies u if something drops
u either have to pay

Yep

Idrk tbh
"whatever's in stock"
I have $838.90 now to spenf
Spend
you could go for the 6800xt
since it's cheap
Yeah
The thing is
I’m asking my parents for a good aio for Christmas
i am coming to ur house
when u get ur parts
bc u want me
Yos
to bild ur computer
I already have ram and ssd installed
But yeah
I don’t wanna screw up the pins 😳😳
hf with ur covid-19
cy has superior screwmanship
make sure to have ur free cysupport coupon on hand
No the pins on the cpu dumb ass
LMAO
yes
they aren't that hard to get in
I've installed the cpu >1 time
ive done 2 intel
1 amd
I've done
10 amd
I just don’t wanna break it cuz it’s my first time building one
why? because I kept swapping cpus
on friday
to test my mobo
also I have a junk 1300x so I don't care what happens to it
Bruh
so I can test out stuff with that first
Cy
yes
Intel bad hrrrr
Do u have a cooler I could borrow
No
No
No
Damn it
um
I do
whaddya want it for
So I can use it until Christmas
That’s a virus
Bet
what
he exported
the chat
The thing that Cy just sent
Oh
wait I know how to benchmark my cpu
I was completely rong
ill open my hangouts chat history with this person I used to talk to in 9th grade
i wanna make a universal benchmark
that runs
on everything
wrong her
leilani
who is that
the one
who
you
stand next to all the time
i do not
as a matter of fact
i dont even know who that is
anyway back to my benchmark
i want my benchmark
to run
on all cpus
silverbench
cuz
i wanna benchmark
my ESP8266
what a strange correlation indeed
ah yes
and compare it
to my actual computers
and like my raspberry pi
y?
Tensillica Xtensa
What is that?
ESP8266
What is that
Cy i give u the honors
hahah
5900x go brrr
i wanna know
90 fricken k
how much performance it has
more than your cpu
so i must test it
but i want numbers that i can relate
to my other chips
so
i need a universal benchmark
1
wait
Is it 1 or 9?
PEMDAS
1
I think it’s 1 too
P
E
MD
AS
apparently it can do 13 mbps
serving data
which is not bad
i wonder
if
it could render webpages
ah right thats the correct way to write it
okay it loaded the chat history
very
fast
so I am surprised
When you get a 75% on a precalc test 😳😳😳😳😳
F
A-
Now a B-
Lmao
the worst I got on a test was a 79%
then I retook it
I got a 69%
and got an 85
Twice
OO HAHAH FUNNY 6969
mine was 50%
FUNNY SEX BUNBER HEHE
on a 2 point test
my best grade in precalc
was a 103
I’m doing honors
same
i was doing honors
last year
I make tons of small mistakes
I’m very good with general concepts and problem solving
Just my small mistakes fuck me up
my grade
in calc rn
after he enters the latest test
akhil knows it probably
yes
i do
what does samuel think it is
yeah

then you do make epsilon_flash
and ur done

As her out nerd
leilani
the one who you stand next to all the time
we get romantically interested in people far older than us
it's okay cy
Wtf

AOffL
Hola

if you mention her
leilani
the one who you stand next to all the time
you will always get a response
Nice
imma do my homework
I would recommend you stop
While that is true, you don't have to remind me of it
I do not want to be reminded of me
Since I already know myself
its not for you, ramesh
just never mention Her again, and it wont appear
Uh oh its broken
I did not?
I said "Samantha"
leilani
the one who you stand next to all the time
Her
That is not the same.
Fortunately
*sigh
Or I would be a really terrorized person
what is this make command for
for
making omega
j4 is four threads
yea ik that
what is Omega username?
try and see heh
i will later
or try cy
i have to first install epsilon sdk first
you have to get past chapter 29 really
ah
that
alright
i wanna modify epsilon
did samantha get a numworks
did u also do this make command and the theme command in the same line?
yes
alrighty
akhil
i should have done -j12
ik why it's not working
since i have 12 theads
i thought it was cores not threads
akhil
are you
having problems
wanna have a benchmark
because you're not using linux akhil
what no
u can use mac first off
linux easier
second i have not even tried
its legit just git and make commands
and the sdk is in homebrew
okay cy let's have a test
test what
change the j to whatever you want
i need to boot into Linux for that
which i dont wanna do
why would u want to change the j value?
faster
done
ah
20 seconds
to compile
idk i remember it took like 45-60 seconds yesterday
on j4
im doing
j**2**4
thats not bad
no it isnt
now
compile me opencv
okay
i will do it
really
how do I do it
like the fun version
what do you want me to do
tell me what you'd like and I'll do it
tbh i dont remember
okay well if you find out I will definitely do it
i just remember it drove me insane
because like
i wanted the arm v6 version
and the tutorials online were like
oh...
just
use a pi zero
and i was like
I can compile it
wft that's gonna take 10 hours
so i compiled it on my pc
and it took 12 minutes
idk how to do it tho
i forgot
but i didn't know how to transfer it to the pi zero
did you know
the original ifone is arm v6
like the raspberry pi zero
ılırıl
İstanbul
sure did
sər did
estonian?
no
ugh
should i?
idk mabye
i could prob do it in a few mins
pretty sure it's estonian, or hungarian
hungarian
imma do
for some reason its telling me i did not balance it but i did
whats ur kwestion tho
like whats wrong
lemme try
hold on
uh
seems balanced to me
exactly
idk whats wronf
maybe the (s) stuff
shouldn't be there
doubt it though
it has to be
and the spaces dont change anything
wait
so you got the rest of them right
with that formatting
nope
i got one right
hold on lemme do them
the other 2 r wrong
which means im formating them weird
with the coefficient
do i have to include a 1?
nope
that doesnt work either
this one as well
tech jesus
yes
middle finger
haha
Nerd

shush
şəş
Israel > Palestine change my mind
k so now im lost
Aluminum shouldn’t have the 3 at the start
why
And I should have a subscript of 2
why
Ur not balancing it
ik but like
Ur j writing the skeleton thingy
It’s weird
Just do it
ow wait
its because
they are not polyatomic elements
iodine is a diatomic
Brinclhof
I
so I_2
diatomic
Ye
whatever
i should remember the diatomics
Same haha
I didn’t get it at first either
what is the fun word thingy
?
the something family
I can’t remember
The HON family maybe?
ow right
hydrogen
oxygen
nitrogen
flourine
nah
Never have fear of Ice Cold Beer
Nitrogen
Hydrogen
Flourine
Oxygen
Iodine
C?
Nitrogen, Hydrogen, Flourine, Iodine, whatever C is, Br
Bromine
Chlorine
yea
Cl is chlorine
Yea
Hey sam, 4.1 question 5 answer
?
so the diatomics
are an upside down L
+ Hydrogen
that makes sense ok
someone give me answer for the last question
the one where u actually have to balance an equation
wait which one
cuz i may have done it
also
what is the aqueous (thing)
is it (L)
for liquid
no
aq
aqueous and liquid r different things
not that one
k
cuz there are 3
that is the one i did
this one
gracias
de rien
"Thanks for doing my homework for me"
hes doing mine for me
we are all
doing homework
tbf i had that, i was just missing an aq at the end
for each other
yes
wanna just trade assignments
like
you can write a 1200 word IRR
song
haha
and i could like
no thanks
do whatever APUSH thing
i have english to do anyway
u wanna present for me?
push a
no
even though I'm not bad at presenting
let's see how fsat my new computer renders a video
is it good
uh wut
3 minutes
ha zoom
r u kidding me?
yes
not powerpoint
i know it is zoom
its suppose to be 10-12 min long
i forced my groups to use powerpoint
dummy
I would never do that
for all my projects
just like I don't
well no
force people
to use
i just
libreoffice
downloaded the file
since that is stupid
as a powerpoint
this is just me
and made the video in powerpoint
I cut out the rest in the video editor
i would send you a hitfilm project to export
oh thats fine then
but ur linux
doesnt matter
zande assumes no one knows how to edit videos
but I do know how to edit videos
no I mean the presentation quality (minus microphone quality)
yea it looks fine
its clear and stuff
good
'tis gone now
i would join
i do not
u prob can look up SA discord online
and find some
what is SA discord
he wants a discord server on the books
stormlight archive
i see
ok
yea
Omega dark mode
Looks god awful
use red
that's why it is awful
Red + Darkmode?
Hmm lemme try
red + dark mode is ok
but i didn't like the dark theme myself
yeah try it
also time it and tell me
i want to prove the 5900x speed
How do i time?
Time(command)?
add
time
before the command
which number u want
the one before user or after
the one after user
41.07s
Wtf happened here
dont ask
no
do ask
cool
that is obv expected
u have x2 more threads then me
thast why ur x2 faster than me
im running a test
!
in wsl
wsl v1
not v2
Not bad
Not bad at all
yea but epsilon light is better
i agree
BRO THAT FINGER
clip
ur nails akhil
LONG BOI
oof
i will
i feel like im going to get some gold out of this contact name soon
it gets stuck on objcopy
Charles Booth
really?
mine takes like <1 second for objcopy
look idk its running in wsl
mine it blows through everything
wsl1 bad for filesystem performance
yea
so anything could happen
try Linux
if anything, the last part takes a few more seconds
i should
imma try linux
YAY
gimme moment to boot
also make sure you update
since like
im using pop os
latest thing
which version
20.04?
20.10?
idk hold on
BRO IM JUST HERE FOR PC PARTS WTF IS THIS CHAT
it's
actually pc parts
we are benching
oh rly
Lmao
yeh
k so
how do you take screenshots
scrot?
no
no like
you do
control shift printscreen
then
control v it here
for taking a screenshot of a window and copying it to clipboard
you do
control alt printscreen
control v
for the entire screen it's control printscreen control v
to save to disk
do commands without control
what is "user"
the one you should care about I think
lemme see
i dont think it took 2 mins tho
real
yknow what
imma just use my phone stopwatch
it doesn't really compile for me
did u clean?
yes
like
it doesn't compile as in it doesn't have a final output
it fails to compile
lemme try getting it to compile
compiling with 4 threads is fun
its the real that you care about
thats how long it actually takes
so mine took 40 seconds
hold on
same as me
how long did ramesh take
18
clean downloading
wait
what EXACT command did you use
me?
no cy
make clean
then make -j some number
-j128
i tried 12, 24, 48 all same
41 seconds
same
the exact same
apps/Makefile:12: apps/atom/Makefile: No such file or directory
re clone the git
which branch?
master
not a branch
here
its mainly epsilon.elf thats the problem
it takes too long
git checkout omega-master
regardless of anything
yea
that takes a solid while
what is that command doing
thats the emulator
i think
wait
cause u run /.epsilon.elf when u do the simulator
if u do git checkout u can checkout different branches
wait ramesh
I know
that
time make PLATFORM=simulator
after doing that but clean
wait I KNOW WHAT I DID WRONG
hey cy
yes
have u seen omega_dev
no
i kinda wanna install it
link
I kinda got it to work
whats so nice about it
idk
just looks intresting
wait
Guys
what you sent me
is just regular omega
3080 or 6800xt
6800xt
Reasoning?
Besides price
wait nvm
better raster performance
cheaper
so if you want good now get 6800xt
if you want good later get 3080
I just feel like the 3080 has a  more complete bundle
A
Idk
I would go with radeon cuz linux drivers, but that's not a thing for you
wait how do you get the dev version
yeah its just development branch
cd Omega
git checkout omeag-dev
git checkout omega_dev
omega
it says bad
no underscore
it says that it would
git clone it into a new folder
then use sudo
SUDO?
no sudo
why no sudo?
fine do this
and then do git checkout
it says my branch is up to date
idk then
with origin/omega-dev
is that good?
ig
i havent tried installing dev yet
i want that RTC
what rtc
what is rtc
real time clock
is that in the dev
think so
make clean doesnt work
it came up in the 1.21 beta changelogs
huh?
ask ramesh
he just fixed that problem
hi ramesh
solve my problems
Omega - “Omega does what Epsilon’t”
wait now i cant get it to do the checkout
hold up
what did u clone?
okay thats good
i thought u did clone the dev website
idk why checkout wont work
checkout works if i dont do —recursive
but u need to do recursive
for the submodules
yea so
um
idk, u can try to get it to work
but compiling is oddly satisfying
idk why
if i do recursive
i can compile i believe
yes
yea so i can only compile when i do —recursive
and i can only do checkout if i dont do —recursive
wait so how do you see the changelog
hmm, uh
like how did u know there was rtc
complete changelog
ah i see
i wonder what the discord bot does
where even is the 1.21 version
what eeven is that
hey ramesh
hi
how do you get the dev version of omega to compile
wait
give me
20 minutes
and i will respond
bye
um
why
k
linux scrolling is giving me a headache
like a genuine headache
how?
its too slow
then use windows
tell me how to compile the dev channel
im not unbooting and rebooting
unbooting huh
never heard that one before
debooting
anti-booting
never heard that one as well
neither have i heard of that one
anti-booting sounds like a movement against booting
also if theres a font i like less than segoe ui
its this telegram font
it is awful
i hate it
i want something better
pretty sure u can change it
how
idk
dont ask me
ask
im using mac store telegram
GOOGLE
im using lunix telegram
i dont like lunix telegram
i want faster scrolling
use a faster scroll wheel
or a free spining one
those r fun
ah
akhil understands
why
that is not an option at the moment
see i wanted to get one of those on prime day
but they didnt go on sale
they didnt?
akhil does not know about using linux like a normal perosn
ramesh how to compile dev channel
yea i just use mac
instead of googling
im rameshing
so he is a verb now?
yes
let me see
okay
just
do what
clone this
then go in and make however you want
i wanna do OMEGA_USERNAME="Cy's Numworks"
but it wont work
since
it has a max character limit
of what
15
characters
it is 13 characters
what i want
i think its the apostrophe
i say it weird
Cy's iPhone XS
how do i do an apostrophe in the cli
like tu-vla-kuv
even tho there is no u
sounds right
idk
how do u say his name?
thaylen is pretty consonant-heavy
i say
tv-lak-v
i used to just say 
"tee vee lakh vee"
no
how do u say tv in that
i cant make such sounnd
tv
wihtout
like
wait i kinda get how ur saying it
I KNOW WHAT A ZEMSTVO IS FROM HGHII
like this
wait no
like
tvvvvvvvv
like that
die
stupid website
blur
thers blur
on FIREFOX
tell me immediately how to get blur in firefox
idk
go to
spoiler-warning-blur > * {
    filter: blur(50px);
firefox uses filter
not backdrop-filter
please try it
RTC
i will gimme a moment i gotta get back to windows
ew
wait
the filter property does not do it to the background
*sigh
that is sad
here
listen
it is a bad pronunciation
if you want the actual backdrop filter
you must enable it
i must eat dinner
i will now anti-boot linux
and boot windows
and leave
good bye
Nice
akhil how do you say it
Ill send a recording later
wtf my old cpu would crash before even rendering this video
like
it would take >12 minutes and crash
this thing renders in 4 minutes
thats good

now i get to see what everyone is listening to
i like this electro swing tho
its nice
心
kokoro
:D
good
i have an answer ^
dir is a list of strings
what should this do
uh
i want to print each item in the list
throw a syntax error?
or
it prints the entire list
how to do that
uhm
with shorthand notation
newline?
or space
newline
well
i mean
print("\n".join([i for i in dir]))
i think
no
print("\n".join(dir))
but actually
i want
to print
it does
1. list item 1
2. list item 2
etc
um
cygh
okay
i got it
what is ramesh listening to right now
i am curious
interesting
mpv works
k
other than here
i dont really care about here
what does enumerate do
it adds an index
to the iteration thing
it like
for each iteration i think it returns a destructurable object
so then you do i, item and destructure into index, item
i see
ok
this seems useful
AutoHotKey
it does http requests
which means
i can make hotkeys
that control my room lights
Nice
so i have AppsKey+1 through 9 and 0 and accent key
set to control my lights
which is fun
imma eat dinner bye
xboxx
xbox x
right
series x
Idk mabye
Game looks really good
It has potential
Its just how the team makes it
Alsow
when are you finishing the great gatsby
I will have finished reading by tmrw
WoR is good
trust me
and the second part of the way of kings is just
good
you start to see why the book is so glorious
I will read it
wor > twok > oathbringer
oathbringer was meh imo
Hmm alright
Im so fcking excited for this
I want to get the WoR ending
it's so lit
like
Its made by IOI
it's just SO good
Really?
no more
Didnt u say WoK ending was good
WoR is best
Hes totally getting a shardblade
Oathbringer is just a bit like
why you say that
finish way of kings
trust me you'll like it
i could give you more names and
Bruh
it would probably make you
read to the end tonight
What if syl is a shardblade
where did you get that idea from
legitimately curious...
Idk
keep reading akhil keep reading
Syl was just there right
yeah
but like
does dalinar have a spren
does adolin have a spren
no, which makes me not think its right
they dont have sprens
okay
keep reading
you have to get to
words of radiance
but u kinda get the feeling the Syl is just more than a spren
to understand shardblades
yes
she's kaladin's gf
haha
kaladin x syl ship
easily
yes
do you know what shadesmar is?
nope
okay
then keep reading
honestly though
i just want the bridgemen's stories
like how can rock see syl
yea
thats intresting
sanderson
loves
dramatic irony
so much
his entire book is built on it
that's what makes it so good
especially dramatic irony if you've read it before
since you can pick up on all the stuff before it happens
do you think there is no end of social commentary in the way of kings
i feel like there is so much social commenatry in these books
yknow whats cool
windows is getting a cli package manager
the preview is available now
its called winget
um...
?
I searched for spotify
there were a bunch of results
i see
on windows you get the actual spotify
it also has
freecad
and itunes
i also
get the real
spotify
and putty
EW
putty is useless
serial terminal
this is a song
yes telegram has a music player
it does
the problem with winget is that at the moment it doesn't support appxbundle
they're STILL in stock
wow
is ubuntu or centos more lightweight
ubuntu
k
or ask
mr. kolmer
see
theres this vps service
they will give me a server
for $12/y
but
Mr. Kolmer even suggested buying me an unRaid license
i only get 128 mb ram
so um
and i can choose between
ow wait theres also debian
is this
godaddy
no
reprise hosting
essentially
theres this thing
which is probably bad
for $1/mo
ask jp
theres aws for $3/mo
but it is also kinda bad
oo fancy
aws is better
imo
and amazon is bad
dont like amazon
then theres digitalocean
for $5
which is better than the aws
its like the standard $5 tier
then theres azure
which
idk
then theres google
linode
whos pricing is a hot mess
vultr
wait lemme check them
hmm
actually
i like vultr
they have some realllly low end plans
they have a $2.50
and a $3.50
i would have to use ipv6 tho
is that a problem
yes
i do not have ipv6
whats the deal with ipv6
what does that mean
you "dont have it"
i cannot
access ipv6
i see
hmm
that's a problem
i dont think i can either
welp
i guess that's out of the question
where did you get this from
Why
why u guys gotta be like this
Dang it, if I only took a pic of Ramesh
Ok fair
ahhhhhhhhhhhhHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
old pc
Yes
i changed it to wife
now the person on the left is
a yandere
Nice pc
yeah
this is a nice pc
Ah kevball
SCREW MOASH
tg is dead
?
sorry
im watching this rn
since
TECH JESUS
im fine with apple
as long as it isn't new stuff
YES
Dihydrogen Monoxide is dangerous
What happened here
Dihydrogen Monoxide happened
I came back
To 100 messages
Ah
Cap
it is dangerous
Why?
:dup_bird:
Im charging my kindle
i mean unless you have a better domain
i wanted to do is akhil reading
can't buy a .in
actually I probably could
U prob could
but it's not free
i got it better
Huh
Thats too long
Moash is totally the villan isnt he
you want to know?
Hes totally gonna punch kaladin
Or one of the High princes
get to book two
Or Rock
Hes gonna punch someone
Thats for sure
Ooooo what if he punches dalinar
oh you keep reading
Or Elhokar
i accidnetally want to coppermind
keep reading
What if he pushes kaladin into a ditch
keep readinggggggggggggggggggggg
gg
Alright
also
can't you read while your kindle is charging
I mean normally yes
why charge kindle
when you have this
Because i have to find the pg i was at
So i gotta turn it on for a sec to find where i was
you shaid
chapter 29
Yea but where in it
just read around
you will remember
What that for?
U BOUGHT IT?
not the cpu
Yea ik not the cpu
Why?
Why did u?
porque quiero crear un sitio de web
But why that domain?
cy is attempting to use google cloud
Ah gl
that's a static site
thats a web service site
or i guess it was
Doesnt work
until it died
502
google cloud is free
which is why im interested
entitled credit card user
firstly
im using a debit card
and u have one of those
and secondly
well there is no secondly
it is good
f1-micro
for free
for ever
Wait actually?
yes
well
ok
so
its 1 vcpu 1gb ram 1gb transfer 10gb storage
per month
I need a cloud service so i can set up a mail server
Cause my home is stupid
and you see
And i cant use the mail ports
so
when you create an account
with a payment method
they give you this and $300 credit
for free
Ooo nice
but
the $300 credit is only for 12 months
after 12 months
you lose your credit
and
you have to enable auto billing
Oh no
in order to keep your f1-micro
but
So if u go a bit more than what it is
U get charged
as long as you dont exceed 1gb transfer
they wont actually charge you
but
Yeah its like aws
like tbh
im willing to pay a little per month
in case
i go over quota
like $1 or 2
Yea but more than that nah
the thing is tho
for hosting most of my websites
which have cloudflare
not very much data transfer occurs
Yeah
if əmənə pay for web hosting tho
imma go with digitalocean or vultr
Digital
vultr has a $3.50 plan
ocean doesnt
Hmmm would 1gb transfer be enough for a mail server?
I'm reading about Brightlord Meridas Amaram
probably not
Thats what I thought
the paid ones give you ridiculous amounts compared to that
yeah unless you disable attachments
like
1tb
then it might be fine
half tb
Well u get 300$ first month
I need to figure out how to use this
So how much is like the cheapest paid?
first year
?
you mean what is the cheapest paid one available
Yes
um
well
Yea first year
theres this sketchy one
for $1 per month
but it looks bad
how do you like
politely ask if someone is gay
and it only has 128mb of ram
so im like
no
Yea
theres vultr $2.5
but it only has ipv6
What is the best one in google cloud?
Like not the most expensive
google cloud is a complete mess
i have no clue
they have like 750 different services
Yea there are alot rnt there?
and within those
like 750 different options
Hmm digital ocean is 5$ i think
it is
they have simple pricing
help
Just ask
“Excuse me good sire, but may I ask if you find pleasure with the same gender”?
i like the vultr $3.5 tho
cuz it is actually usable
the cheapest actually usable
now
that being said
Whats its specs
like i was saying
what about furries
if you go to aws
they have some interesting options
Thats not bad actually
i believe they have a $3.70 plan
which may be better than vultr
idk
but
they also have some special thing
called
idk what but its cool
where essentially
Idk i just want a mail server
you take whatever no one else wants on amazon's servers
and pay less
but
i dont think its available for these really cheap ones
its more for like big data workloads
that would cost thousands of $
What is?
this amazon thing
hold on
but
i like the google thing
cuz its free
which is inf cheaper than all of these
and
i get 1gb of ram
which is nice
tbh i dont understand how it can only be 1gb transfer
that makes no sense
at all
i think its a marketing thing
they want you to pay for more
anyway like i said
thers cloudflare for a reason
im writing a thing
hes not watching rn
he just got systemctl to worok
the problem
was that
apparently
pip3 install
and sudo pip3 install
are 2 different things
the sudo
has its own pip3
asd;flkajs;dflkj
no
sudo installs
to a different place
it installs
yes
you see
globally
you see
i was running as cyfinfaza
ramesh knows these things
but systemctl
so cy could ask ramesh as well
was running as su
ah yes
you can also
and so
make a systemd service
run as a specific user
þē?
i had to do sudo pip3 install flask
that way
the sudo
had flask too
Look, gancho
i know
but
<insert more SA references>
nvm
;lasjkdfl;asjk
i bothced this one
or
you do
the user
as cyfinfaza
not root
but i can just install to the root user
i am now the usb alliance
i name things properly
ROL
i must do my homework
i do not do homework on fridays
that is just not how it works
but I might do a little bit
you see
i procrastinate
the assignment was due yesterday
but he was like
ow
you can have an extra day
idrc
i am tired of making websites
dot
but im lazy so im not doing much
UGH I ACCIDENTALLY CLICKED BUY NOW AND BOUGHT A 5800X FROM AMAZON

Huh?
Well have fun explaining to ur parents
im trolling
im not that stupid
did you fall for it?
Greg Gardener
is worrying me
Not really
aw
I’ve never heard of a case where u can’t cancel
That was what gave it away
also
the buy now
requires a confirmation
so does the add to cart
sometimes
the wonders of wildcard dns
its literally not even that long
its just like
still too long tho
for me

I want
Something
with Cortex-X
i wanna get a ThunderX
server
thats like from 2016
and its not cortex x
but i want it
you need
money for that
a thunderx costs like $30
no one wants them anymore
like a ThunderX 2
idk about server boards tho
that take it

idk if i would call it polite
but
sure
Part 1
This article is about gender stereotypes in politics. The author argues that voters view candidates, in part, through gender stereotypes, that affect their view of both the position of the candidate, and their ability to deal with an issue. They also argue that these stereotypes result in worse effects for republican women candidates than they do for democratic women candidates.
on to part 2
which has to be like 3 paragraphs
should i have done this yesterday
Fix your capitalization
?
would you like...
part 2?
Part 2
The author does not directly make this claim, but rather draws it as a conclusion in response to research and data collected. They examine the data that is collected and compare it to research that was previously done. Where their data match previous research, they confirm an identified stereotype. They then proceed to use the existence of these stereotypes to:
1. Compare them to data about actual outcomes, and draw their conclusion about gender stereotypes transcending party, and
2. Identify how these stereotypes would affect women of different parties, and then draw their conclusion about the difference in the favorability of these stereotypes to women between the different parties. 
Their progressive approach makes these main claims:
1. Gender stereotypes clearly exist in regard to the following issues and positions:
• Education issue competency – public bias towards women
• Crime issue competency – public bias towards men
• Abortion stance – women are more likely to stand for abortion
• Women take a more liberal stance overall
2. The above gender stereotypes (other than the last one) transcend a candidate’s party. For example, democrat or republican, voters consistently believe women to be better suited to deal with education. 
3. The stereotype placing women as more liberal than men is disadvantageous to republican women candidates, as, since the republican party is biased towards conservative candidates, a stereotype labeling women as more liberal negatively affects their view to republican voters.
sign it
the rtc finally killed it
that was actually pretty fast
i enabled the rtc 3 days ago
at 50% charge
i should disable the rtc
cuz like
imma be in a chem test
and its gonna die
yes i am aware of this
it is mildly exciting
the reason it is mild
is bc u have no cooler
so like
Kraken x63
Will order soon
what do you still need
cooler and gpu right
Ye
YAY
so you see
i have been working
Ok
plz send screenshot
of what u see
I use bing sorry
whatever browser
i wanna see if it works
but then also akhil has safari
i see
ok
i was expecting desktop but ok
Ignore the black top right thing
but you see
there is a problem
it is supposed to be blurred
the welcome thing's background
Thats j me binge watching the office cuz ppl called me living under a rock
see when people tell me im living under a rock
i tuck in further under my rock
cuz i dont wanna see them
Understandable
The problem is with that
While there are bad ppl
There are also tons of good ppl
ik i just have a mental push to do that
idk why
anyway
I am here
I shall do this in a bit
Cap
Complete cap
cap?
cy is lost
How would one explain cap
Lying
Well here lemme say it like this
It means or refers to lying
Yes perfect
Yep
k
akhil u at ur mac
cuz its really ez
Or say “that’s cap”
screenshot
done
Ok one sec then
argh
i guess i need to find the safari version of blur
and
why
yes
are
those
Looks p good on iPhone ngl
those
buttons
cut
the buttons
r cut
a;sdlkfja;sdlfkj
k good
i was worried
took a really long time to load
use normalize.css
what is that
it will speed some stuff up
look it up on github
k
but
now
theres another problem
the scrollbar
bad
also another bad
when i scroll there i no snapping
how its supposed to look
a;sdlkfja;sldkfj ;aslkdfja safari
i can go inbetween
why do i have to code for safari
but after 3 sec or so it auto moves it
why
oh
i8dk
then
i cant change it
if it does actually work
just set a ios header
so that if its safari it fixes some stuff
i would
but it appears
that it actually does work
just safari delays it
how about the animations
do they work
what animations
*sigh
i do not see any animations
um
like when u click buttons on side?
reload
that works
k so you see them
k
alright
good to know
i see
so the scrolling sorta works
meh it works well enough
for safari users
safari users
can have their problems to themselves
at least it works after a second or two
now to fix the blur
alright
it blurs now in safari
i think
except
yknow what happens now
safari
is like
nope
imma just
not
load ur images
maybe ill load one
ow wait
now its gone
no more images on cys website
?
it does
doens it?
u sure?
yes
do you see
how now
it is blurred
and before
it wasnt
Oh the text
yes
i though u were blurring the background
no
then yea it works
not on ifone
well maybe its my moms ifone
thats fine
try urs
go to site
Blur
no the blur works
but on hers
the images werent showing up
Thats weird
try regular safari
not embedded
and record video
Blur works
But ur images aint loading
Its really finicky
the other issue
is that safari's vh
is not the actual viewable area
its also the area that gets blurred
under the options
im getting frustrated
everyone's website is better than mine
well
actually
mines not the greatest
u dont have one yet
its just something to hold the page
i do
not a real one
i have to fix the ssl cert but
it works
link
idk why its doing that error
your cert does not match ur domain
ah
cause im using netflify hosting
ill switch to nginx later
i just use cloudflare
nginx no https
go to cloudflare
cloudflare do magic
then
hmm okay
butiful lok
yes
good lok
i like lok
wait it work now
is cloudflare using my netlify hosting?
um
its not working
hmm
just wait a bit
did you do anything
the nameservers are still switching
what did you do
i signed up with cloudlfare
i see
put my domain
and did fun stuff
and now it somehow works
Scott Fitzgerald's wife was named Zelda

i oughta sleep right
which means being organized
you see
yes
i spent like

4 hours
i get good sleeep

then do stuff
but you see
even if i did my hw first
that way i dont have to kill myself finishing hw

hey other children
other than matt
and i
Hello
reload ur page
but hes studying apparently
btw its been updated
text me there
Yea try not to bother him these couple of weeks
akhil
try out the new version
akhil
where r u
r u not in c0
when your raspberry pi
is downloading
at 1,380 petabytes per second
That good or bad?
idk
Ill assume good
cy is mad
he is trying to perform tuya-convert
on his pi
and
this
is what his pi is saying
Oof
literally what the f
haha
Im from Walla Walla, Wa
how the f
does my pi4
not have a wifi interface
a;lskdjf;alskdjf;aslkdjf
Oof
Wait u prob messed up a config
Ive messed up the config before, made the interface unusable
Windows has died
I'm flashing too many usbs at once
*accidentally flashes his ssd instead *
Ikr
What are the main differences between C sharp and java
wait hold up
they broke my oled displays
because they were in the same package as heavy metal mounting bars
oof
but there were 3 oled displays
and only one broke
so I was like
give me money
and they were like
ok
hers mony
u no need return
Hyelp plz
c sharp is microsoft
java is oracle
they're both c based in terms of syntax
why do you want this information
No reason
i now have 7 oled displays
1 of which is broken
Jk I’m making a game in unity with someone
oh gl
i see
i tried, but gave up
that is cool
cause i cannot make assets for my life
We alr have a plan for the game after a single day of brainstorming
you should make ur game run on my oled display
But I’ve never used unity or C sharp
me neither
well
i have used c#
but not in unity
Is it j java?
well sorta
tbh i did it so long ago
wait
remember that geologic time model
in stem
i made mine in C#
with Universal Windows Platform
Oh ok
oh and i also made the BerryTracker in c# UWP
what
this
i have been summon'th
yea
that was cool
looked nice as well
i wanna learn android developement
but its like
i wanna learn ios development
u hav to giv permission to use the internet
and i dont wanna
yknow what i wanna do
plug one of my white oleds into my pi
flutter?
and use it as a display output
hmm
and then
play Minecraft on it
dont think it would work
the problem is i only have 1 bit color
but u can try
u need what 8?
or 16
no so what it would have to do
is like
take the image from the pi's screen
it being some kode
and it would have to convert it to 1 bit color
and downscale to 128x64px
hmm
then send the image via smbus to the oled
which can refresh at about 35 fps i think
or 45 i forgot
the main issue is the color bit depth
its one bit
so like
no grey
just white
or black
ooo
i could make a terminal
so u dont need to plug in a screen
it would be a tiny terminal though
im trying to install windows on my raspberry pi
and its not working
bc the software is crashing
cuz im trying to flash windows to a usb instead of an sd card
i think
yes
sam what r u guys gonna do for assets and stuff?
r u gonna create them from scratch or use pre-existing ones?
Neither of us have photoshop
So props pre existing ones
How do you download assets
Like
Where do we go for assets
they r like .png files
google
Oh lmao
i have some paid ones but most would be free
or u can get free photoshop
Any good websites?
those assets are pretty nice
r either of u taking any art elective this year?
Nah
ah
i got free photoshop cause im doing animation
Bruh
I’ve never used it before
Let's create a new poll. First, send me the question.
Intel or AMD
Creating a new poll: 'Intel or AMD'

Please send me the first answer option.
Intel
AMD
👍 Poll created.
AMD
AMD
so then i fixed it
and the first thing it said after it came back up
was
i opened it and got a zoom link
tf
how on earth
oh
its probably one i sent to ramesh
i wouldnt try and join
i wont
i have a bag full of inductors
i am going to build a power supply
very cool
try not to blow urself up
see my goal
is full ac to dc
but
imma start small
please do
i am just going to start
dont blow or start a fire
with low voltage dc
to dc
im making a switching psu
ik how they work
its essentially
pwmming an inductor's output
with a mosfet
and using a diode to keep power flowing when its off
then you use the ramping properties of the inductor
to create a zig zag voltage
that's close to the one you want
then use a capacitor to smooth it out
it needs a controller tho
also my inductors may require a very high frequency
so idk how this is gonna work
gl
but you see
then
once i have this
i can create an ac to dc changer
that's the dangerous one
its pretty simple though
just 4 diodes to form a full bridge rectifier
then a capacitor for smoothing
then feed the ac-dc phase into the switching phase
and you get a nice
smooth
regulated
variable
dc output
“Full Bridge Rectifier” - ElectroBoom
Fuuuuuuuul
bridddddddge
rektifiyeah
it makes the bumps
much bumps
nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
then
the switching phase
makes zig zag
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
ewektwoniks awe fwun
Q is the mosfet
D is the diode
and L is the inductor
Ooo fancy
I should learn how to read electrical diagrams
ah this spreadsheet
*sigh
oh god
differential equations
all i care about is that khz number
how this look
too thin
thats 10 px, so double?
i mean
sure
still too thin
also
maybe round it
like rather than have sharp edges
idk how to round lines in ps
like round the ends
or the joints
lemme see
here hold on
i mean at this point i might as well make them rounded rectangles
well maybe thicker
hold on
frankly idk its up to you
but that original was too thin
there u go
yea thats what my master copy will be
hmm ill try some other things
what
see inkscape was being a bad
it literally
made like
a gradient
on something
and then my mouse stopped working
cheap things are wonderful
this was the original
yes
frankly i kinda like it italicized
like mine
well ill play around with it
yes
now you see the issue is
200 khz
is not a fun khz
cuz my mosfet modules only do up to 20 khz
huh
thats not a nice number
so i need a high frequency mosfet
which i think i have
but im probably gonna burn
cuz idk how to use it
yes
dont burn
i will have to read datasheets
would you like a challenge
these are some of the longer datasheets i have had to read
although the ones for mosfets are probably only a few pages
cuz they dont do much
they exist
they flow current
they stop current
and they burn
so 4 pages
compared to a microcontroller
that does literally anything
btw
you see in that image
how
the backup rtc runs in shutoff mode mode
that means that
it is possible
to keep the rtc running
in this chip
even in the lowest energy mode
which draws current in a matter of microamps
idk what i did
microamps?
fractions of microamps
holy
they call them Energy Friendly for a reason
i have a dev board with one of those on it
i need to get a dev board
frankly
get the same one i have
the stm nucleo f4
that way
we can collab
on understanding
it
o yeah cause stm code is weird
__
_
well start with mbed studio
its easier
how this look?
hold on
oh yeah i should get this as well
reminds me of this logo
hmm its similar
but its not exactly it
get this
imma try arm keil today
its like the old professional software
for arm mcus
after i do my math hw
i should do my hw
but photoshop is more fun
now that's how to think like me
funny

yea
you are not doing your hw first
and i am
i also dont have any hw so
i have to write my 1200 word IRR by monday
i have to do animation and im done and animation takes like 2 hours
the thing is
today is monday
no next monday
the thing is though
ah
it does not have to be 1200 words
oo
how does this look
interesting
but
for what
?
just as a design
i might use it as my logo on my website
the adafruits are falling out of the sky
yes
YES
YES
also ive downscaled on my phone
so much more stuff fits on the screen
thats good
what did u set it to?
450 i think
386 is what it usually is right
i think it was 360 before
this looks natural
not in person
in person it looks real tiny
huh
on screen
it looks like just a big phone
but that's the point
its supposed to give the feel of a big phone
on a small one
before
after
it looks the exact same
idk its much more pronounced in person
look at the before
hmm
while sitting back in ur chair
then switch to the after
without moving
that sorta reproduces the effect
ah i see it
yeah its not really pronounced
idk i kinda like this the more i stare at it
stop staring at it
ppl dont do that
it will skew ur perception
ig
i shal do animation, and get other peoples opinnions on it
k
half my Christmas lights died
i must figure out why
during that rainstorm
Holy cow 266 messages wtf were u guys doing
That was no rainstorm
Lmao
Its usually like that
what was it then
Idk
It was a thunderstorm
k fine but it wasnt the thunder that killed the lights
Thunderstorm 🌩
it was the rain
Lightning storm ⛈

Signaling Threat: How Situational Cues Affect Women in Math, Science, and Engineering Settings on JSTOR
Part 1
This study argues that situational cues, such as being outnumbered by others of another stereotype group in a certain setting or environment, can have a large effect on their perception of the topic at hand, and their willingness to participate in it. This study examined specifically the perspective of women in MSE domains, a context in which stereotypes and situational cues tend to be very present. 
Part 2
Inherently, this paper is about “identity threat”, which they explain is “a broad threat that people experience when they believe that they may be treated negatively or devalued in a setting simply because of a particular social identity they hold.” They examine what causes this threat to surface and affect the mental conditions and decisions of people, especially women. Before making their own claim, they examine already existing reasoning for the arousal of identity threat effects. They mainly reference how existing stereotypes affect how women perceive themselves in general, and how that is a reason for the aforementioned identity threat issues. They then hypothesize that, in addition to these always present stereotypes, there are also environmental effects that will affect how people who are in these stereotype groups will react and experience identity threat.
This study focuses on the MSE (Math, Science, and Engineering) context, which is a stereotypically male subject. For their testing and their claims, they choose women who identify clearly with this subject, in addition to men who do the same. This way, personally, all participants are interested in and identify with the subject, and only environmental cues and their associated stereotypes should affect how participants will make decisions about the simulated event presented to them. 
They begin by proving their hypothesis true. The results of their testing show that women are more likely to want to be a part of an MSE event that is gender balanced, than they are to the same event male dominated. From this claim they are able to determine that women prefer MSE environments in which they are not outnumbered, and thus deduce that environmental cues have an effect on stereotyped individuals’ perceptions and decisions with regards to activities and events that occur in a context where they are stereotypically stigmatized. 
They further find that the above effects to women in MSE environments generally do not exist for men in the same environments, since they are not stereotypically stigmatized in MSE contexts, thus proving the contrapositive of the last claim true. 
Part 3
The evidence supporting the above claims is mostly sound, with the potential exception of mildly flawed testing. 
The main concern with the evidence in this research is the testing. Once again, the evidence is mostly sound; these are only minor concerns. The researchers used people who “identified” with an MSE context. The MSE context is very broad, and the researchers did not state how the video they played to the participants was supposed to be identifiable to all of them. Say for a moment the video shown related heavily to engineering. Let us also consider the possibility that women generally identify more with science, and men with engineering. Perhaps then, women were more likely to want to participate in a gender balanced event than a male dominated event, because they knew that even though the event was engineering based, they also knew that there would be more females there with whom they could collaborate on the science related to that engineering. This is an unlikely event, and it is unlikely that the researchers would have not considered it, but ways to avoid it are not mentioned in their paper. 
Beyond this, all other signs point to a sound claim. One of the authors, Claude M Steele, is one who I have already examined. Steele has written many papers on this topic, and appears to be quite credible, from past examinations. The paper also uses many sources to back their claims
, some of which are also from papers by Steele, though he is not the most cited in the paper. This paper, while sponsored, also does not appear to be having its goals manipulated by that sponsor, as the sponsor does not seem to be the kind to desire a certain result on this subject.
how stupid does this look?
Kinda
Very
figured as much
ugh im so uncreative
Same
all i can do is copy
i cant think of anything new
like how

its a unique design
Yea
It's a website tho
its not

Just like everyone else.

im installing ubuntu server
i really like it
i created a monstrosity
No, THIS is a monstrosity
wdym?
thats beautiful
i really like the game assets
and how they interact
yes
they have a sort of
professional
quality to them
yea
one recommendation i would say is add more stretch and squash
for movement
yea its not natural enough rn
it feels too robotic
yea
i set zoom to show 49 people on my screen
imma see how this goes
also make sure to keep the asset to stay upright
cause it keeps flipping
oh god
do that for gym
health
sorry helf
shelf
also i got my file upload thing to kinda work
link?
not live yet
just locally
make it live
no see
get ngrok
i tried with txt files
and it works
its similar to this
thats when an image is posted
its just the image data, not the image
yeah so
um
dont serve your images with your web server
serve them with a web server
oops
that makes no sense
like
dont use flask to serve files
oh i see what ur sayinbg]
rocket
flask in my case
ill figure out another way to host them
use nginx
alright i just have to do that for everything
cause with any text file it doesnt download them, it just shows whats on it
idk what mine would do with a text file
this is what mine would be like
like if you click that
yea thats whats suppose to happen
it will download
thats ideally what i want it to do
well ok then that's literally nginx
i did nothing
yea i gotta figure out how to get nginx to work with rust
ur nginx is just hosting static files right?
yes
well
hmm alright
this one hosts more than that
i have like 7 configuration files
oh god
one for each domain
that's how u do it
alright
have u never used nginx
nope
u really should
its like
dont hate me for this
neccesary
ive just been using apache
see ive never used that
apache was really annoying
to set up
imma figure out docker
yes
imma pay attention in class
bye
i see
so they are paying for cloud storage
He
k
actually its 2020, so sure they
uh it would seem so
well if u know
do u know
or not
(They’re) name is Felix Mattick
they
whatever this is irrelevant
what is relevent
is how they are storing their data
yup
which is interesting
because "cloud bucket"
what is a cloud bucket
how much does it cost
its just cloud storage
but whats intresting is the metadata
thats stored in a database
how do you access that cloud storage
uh its usually tied to a ec2 instance
or any vps/cloud vm
it is?
cy doesn't understand google cloud
i mean thats how i use em
if i can explain it in aws, cause thats what i have used
u need to add storage to a vps
google cloud is like st
but for cloud services
so its effectively a way of storing files in a webservery way
heres my issue
what if ppl upload too much
then i will get automatically charged
and that is a bad
see
just set a cron job or file to empty it
no i want it limited
so it cannot exceed a certain size
i do not want to be billed
in fact
i do not want to pay
at all
hmm u would have to see then
i dont plan on doing cloud
cause i have a server\
how much can i get for free
and storage
like 30 g
i mean they said 2.6 cents per gb per month
on google cloud
aws has 30 for free
if u have that cool 1 year thing
im sure google has something for free
but yknow what else i can do
not this
google cloud has autodelete
it does it all for you actually
while im over here having fun with photoshop
cool
just get a server or a lot of storage
30 gb is kinda little
im now interested in google cloud storage
they wont offer more than 50 for free
i wanna see what it can do
even if its not for this project
prob everything
yea
doesnt linus use it for their backups
idk
i dont think so
they have other plans
like archival plans
and stuff like that
I was so close to a rtx 3080 but bestbuy stores more than 250 miles away 😤😤😤😤

Frankly, though I know it has been an important month of gratitude, I'm quite grateful that it's over. I didn't often know what to write, and it's a bit difficult. But, even though it's difficult and something I didn't want to do, that doesn't mean I'm not as grateful as you made us do it. You told us about all the benefits of doing an activity like this, and you're right. It was also a great opportunity to practice French, which really works. And so, while I'm grateful it's over, I'm also grateful that we had the opportunity to do it, and that you show it to us.

J’aime travailler sur mes sites web. Ils sont très importants pour moi. Je les ai fait avec le HTML, le CSS, et avec le Python. Maintenant je suis en train de les mettre sur Google Cloud. Le Google Cloud me laisse les garder quelque part qui n’ai pas ma maison. Il me laisse aussi changer le serveur que j'utilise, si tout à l'heure j’ai besoin d’un serveur plus fort. Je peux faire ça avec les serveurs à ma maison, mais je crois que c’est plus facile de le faire avec Google Cloud. Mettre mes sites web sur Google Cloud et pas à ma maison arrête mes sites web d’avoir des problèmes s' il y a des problèmes à ma maison comme avec l'électricité ou l’internet. Ça le rend aussi plus difficile pour les hackers de hacker dans ma maison. Google Cloud me donne ça gratuitement (avec des exceptions, et pour un service pas très bien), mais il y a aussi Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Linode, Digital Ocean, et Vultr.

im not doing this
haha
curl?
idk wtf it wanted me to do
huh
now if you would excuse me i must go figure out why several random outlets have ceased to function
in my house
remember this
during the rainstorm
yea so somehow
an outside plug
controlled by a switch in the basement
also killed the plug
running our backup fridge
in a completely different part of the house
so now we have to eat all the food in the fridge
cuz its gonna go bad
and it is unclear why the plug doesn't work
why all these plugs stopped working
jtkjgfkjghdjhgfsjhgdfkjhgf
Ha
cy is fustrated
he no kno why
well this is why
this may well be the worst ebay product image i have ever seen
wdym
thats amazinbg
It's happening
Yay
windows is booting
I like how it has the actual rpi logo
And not just Microsoft in words
no its UEFI and whatever
so it can have the logo and all
it just died and rebooted
idk if that is good
Is that a blueberry cake
yes
ha its actually working
its a little weird tho cuz the action light doesn't blink
so the only way to tell if its doing anything
is to touch the chip and feel how much it hurts
Ah Yes
aw I don't think there's gonna be cortana
tf
OOBELOCALHELLO
Hello
its letting me skip that
so
i guess were not gonna get the hello
i wonder if wifi is going to work
that would be nice
RAM is still limited to 3gb tho
ha
we're in
Nice
It good?
um
Run well?
its a little faster than the slowest windows pc I've used
the graphics appear to only be at 30 hz
there's like 4 apps
Yay
and sadly no wifi
so um
o wait
i can plug usb wifi
yknow its actually not that bad
like just going around the ui
the only thing that feels slow is the refresh rate
phone usb tethering
I am using an Application Class 2 micro sd card tho that's like really fast
actually i think the refresh rate
is not a driver issue
the gpu actually cant render scrolling that well
like the mouse moves at 60 hz
I'm silverbenching it
i think its running native edge
idk tho
50
Thats the score
no its gonna be faster
imma say 1500
or 1000
Imma say 80
ha jokes on us
3k
Hmm
I'm telling you
its fast
much faster than you think
its just the gpu is terrible
it can't render windows animations at 60 fps
Used egpu
u need pcie3 for gpu or thunderbolt for egpu
this has neither
imma start using the pi as my main pc
I'm installing unigram
for native UWP ARM64
Why
U have an actual comp
Why use the rpi
Cuz I wanna
....
Sure
I would still use an actual comp
Americans go brrr
Uwp apps aren't working
I'm getting upset
Huh
but
emulation is working
in fact
i think even x64 emulation is working
Ooo
im running regular telegram
which as far as i know is not arm
whats nice tho is that the web is working shockingly well
like
as if i was not on a raspberry pi
How many tabs
not many
but like
How many chrome tabs can it do
with only a few
idk
imma start using it
and see how many tabs
i got like 7 tabs
its a little slow now
and i determined that 64bit emulation
does not work
Hmm
this version of windows doesnt have it
this is actually not the latest version of WoR
but idrc
Vivan was deleted
remember to change your delete timer to longer than 3 months
Ye mines 12 months
i dont wanna go into school tmrw
its too early
and sorta bad compared to virtual
and akash and Michael are no longer there
and they were like the only people i knew in my classes in in person
other than like sam and matt during french
cy is going all virtual at the next available time
also thers koronaviris
and koronaviris is bad
koronav👁ris
yes
wdym
oh I think its cuz they're like the web consortium or something
and they have defined things
that you must follow
ahh
if you want compatibility on the web
that makes sense
yea im way to lazy to make css containers and stuff, so im exporting everything as svg
btw I stopped using the raspberry pi as my main pc
good
cuz like
i need a comp for skool
that doesn't limit me
i cant
just
deal with a raspberry pi
and skool
haha
for school i open like 15 tabs\
that would kill the rpi
for skool i open like 50 tabs
especially ap seminar resarch
the problem with the pi is that like
i don't have a cooler for it
like if you see those images that i sent
its literally some random laptop fan hooked up to a battery
and its loud as hell
yea
but without it
like
just use a heatsink
imma 3d print another one of those nice cases
ah yes
nice case
and maybe put a heatsink on it
i need a pi fan tho
and i have one
but idk where it is
i got 2
jesus keep track of ur stuff
and one of them is in the pi case running my server
the thing is
it does not leave enough space for a heatsink
isnt a pi fan just a smaller fan?
that mounts in a case
well its labeled PI-FAN
its essentially a 30mm fan
yea
that has a dupont connector on it
so you can plug it into GPIO
i has advisory
good bye
ah ok
Ramesh wants you at comp sci
we have comp sci today?
oh rights its thursday
alright lemme finish some work
2:30
no that doenst work
i drew a line
cool
im still trying to figure out why the hell it wont accept my css
hmm
like its literally there
but its not
*sigh
wait
could u do the python get into a file
and then open the file in your browser
wait it would do the same thing
nvm
hmm idk how u would get that
um
my issue
was
mime types
.......
i just have to proxy the mime type as well
man they really have something against you dont they
something similar
not the same language
but u prob could do what it does
i see
well i almost have mine working
so
nice
so most things load
but not all
Hmmmmmmmm
like
Why wont the rest load?
all that loads is the little help button
i will now investigate
Yes do
Did it work?
not yet
there may be a reason why i couldnt find any working versions of this online
Startpage does work
Cy I ordered the nucleo
Michael is gonna have a nucleo
Akhil where is your nucleo
i havent bought one yet
mine came in the mail
alright so i figured out what i must do to bypass the school firewall
i need a really fancy proxy
cuz a normal one doesn't work
i need one
that encrypts the url it wants
as its sending it
Oh god
and then a receiver to decrypt that
so sort of an https proxy
if that's a thing
Good luck
thx
im just using a dns
Yes
Bruh
that big server in my basement

it will not go up in price
unlike tesla stock
tezla
yeah but you could wear them to school
i could also buy an iphone
Gender stereotypes have been an issue in many contexts for as long as we know. In almost all cultures, gender was, for the longest time, something greatly stereotyped to the point that it defined the lives of most people.  As of the last fifty to one hundred years though, increased amounts of research are being done on the topic of gender stereotypes and their effects, due to increasing concern and awareness of the negative effects they have on people and society. Gender stereotypes affect the success of a wide range of entities, especially in sales and education contexts. This Research Report focuses on the effects of “environments”, or the conditions surrounding a person, group of people, or activity and the events preceding that activity, on the mental state and consequent success of entities acting within them. One of the main drivers sitting between stereotypes and outcomes is something called “Stereotype Threat”.
What is this
If I took a research class
I would talk about the gender discrepancy between speech intonation
if you took a research class
you would have to be in a group
you wouldn't have a choice
disgusting
who may not want
to
study
then in that case
the discrepancy in
I will wait
speech
intonation
until later
but all the power to you
if you can find a group
that would like to study that
yes just like if I were to have the power
to find someone in my grade
that pretends I exist
I thought you were studying for the SAT
no
I already took it
ah i see
crazed child
anyway
you can see your psat scores
on Naviance
no
not until tmrw
no
you can
and how do i log into naviance
right now
but at the same time
idk if you need to register
this
hmm
alright im in naviance
but now idk how to actually get scores
now click the to thing
about me
my stuff
test scores
what is the psat out of
1520
i have a 1330
how about you
I have a not a 1330
what, then, do you have?
something
but let me just say
You don't have to share your score
tbh i dont think the sophomore psat really matters
unless you get like
a 1520
yeah
um
yes?
I started learning Korean because I LOVE BTS 💖. I was born in the US and live in the US.
i see
not me
that comment
what do you think
of the design
plz open it in chrome
it makes my fans spin
it's bad
because
like
this grey thing
is hurting me
ok im working on that
i need like
a media query
to detect firefox
and make it solid black
bc firefox users dont care about design
and blur
if you do that
that is bad
what do i do then
it is awful
reduce this blur
it needs to be blurred
other than the blur
what do you have to say
the ugly bar
is ugly
what browser is this
no browser i have used shows that
Firefox
get
out
of
firefox
No
now
you see
i am working on adding my media query
this is why
we
design websites
in firefox
then they work everywhere else
the media query
will disable the scrolling feature completely
and make the background black
for a;sdlkfj;alsdkfjas;d firefox users
no
you won't do that
that way it is at least not broken
what
will
i do then
graphical glitches
linix
litrally linix
probably firefox
since it doesn't happen in chrome
well it will be solid black anyway in firefox
and a message will be displayed to the user
to make them use chrome
you know
you could just
change
the overflow
to overflow: hidden
yes
and then it works
i could
but
i needs to be scroll
in case it overflows
bc it does overflow
so firefox users
will not be able to scroll
but that is fine
cuz it doesn't overflow often
i can scroll
wdym
idk
i think
you should
uninstall chrome
Haha
everyone uses chrome
oh and then we have a-keel
That is just wrong
I use
Firefox
he uses
stupid apple browser
safar-ee
but lemme tell you
the apple browser
is much better
than firefox
I don't swear
idioCY
yes
not
making your website work on firefox
is idioCY
tell me the media kwiree
and the setting
where is the setting
i wanna disable blur in my firefox
for testing
no
google
this is the code
i need
I gtg
bye
bye
this is what firefox users will see
Is this discrimination?
yes
Why do Firefox users not get the fancy blur effect
because
firefox
does not show it
by default
Even safari gets it
you have to go to the scary about:config page
to enable it
Oh thats scawy
so if your browser does not support blur
you get a message
telling you to stop using that browser
i also disabled auto connecting to chat
to avoid the xss attacks on ppl
so you have to explicitly click
the connect button
is now
nice
coppermind is FILLED with spoilers for things I don't know yet
i accidentally spoiled something again
i hate coppermind
All of my tireless reading of aerospace textbooks has finally paid itself off
Ah yes
Gender stereotypes have been an issue in many contexts for as long as we know. In almost all cultures, gender was, for the longest time, something greatly stereotyped to the point that it defined the lives of most people. And implicit bias with regards to gender stereotypes exists in even the youngest of our generations (Martin 1990). As of the last fifty to one hundred years though, increased amounts of research are being done on the topic of gender stereotypes and their effects, due to increasing concern and awareness of the negative effects they have on people and society. Gender stereotypes affect the success of a wide range of entities, especially in sales and education contexts. This Research Report focuses on the societal and cultural aspects of gender stereotyping, as well as the effects of “environments”, or the conditions surrounding a person, group of people, or activity and the events preceding that activity, on the mental state and consequent success of entities acting within them. One of the main drivers sitting between stereotypes and outcomes is something called “Stereotype Threat”.
All individuals are part of various stereotype groups – groups of people that share attributes and stereotypes. The stereotypes that apply to these stereotype groups are usually a mix of positive and negative, and all individuals are part of a stereotype group which is negatively stereotyped in some way or another. Stereotype threat is the “risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group” (Steele 1995). Stereotype threat becomes an issue for people when they are in an environment where a negative stereotype towards them is relevant. For example, say women are stereotyped as being worse than men at math. This stereotype will not matter in most contexts, but once women are placed in a mathematics-oriented environment, their negative stereotype will become relevant, and the effects of stereotype threat may surface. These effects generally consist of increased stress, and consequently decreased performance in many areas. Stereotype threat can also affect decision making, in sales and finance environments. 
Stereotype threat affects people in various environments. One of the biggest ones, though, is education and MSE (Math, Science, and Engineering) contexts. Many groups are negatively stereotyped in this area, but this Research Report will focus on only stereotypes relating to gender-based groups. In general, when it comes to these contexts, negative stereotypes tend to be experienced by women, and so a lot of research surrounding this will be studying the differences between women experiencing negative stereotypes, and men not.
Research has been done to analyze where specifically women are affected in computer science programs (Stoilescu 2011). This research called this the “levels of digital divide”, and they specify 3 levels – access, instruction, and opportunity to foster in culture. They found that in terms of access to digital technology, women are roughly the same as men. In terms of instruction though, a divide starts to appear. And it is finally in the opportunity to foster in computer science culture, that a clear and concerning divide exists. Stereotype threat almost certainly plays a role in this. Proving this is research that has determined that, from a young age, children, especially girls, automatically associate with their gender’s stereotype (Galdi 2014). These children do not neccesarily outwardly state or agree with it, but because they associate with it, they experience the effects of stereotype threat. This likely causes the aforementioned digital divide as these girls grow older. Another fact that may play a role in this is that women prefer gender balanced environments, rather than majority-men environments, and are more likely to be in agreement and willing to participate in these environments (Murphy 2007). This, in combination with automatic stereotype association early on, is likely to be the main cause of the great gender digital divide at a cultural level. Interestin
gly though, despite stereotypes disassociating females with MSE in education, studies show that at a young age, children believe that girls are academically superior to boys (Hartley 2013). They also found that, just like with women in MSE, this stereotype induces stereotype threat in young boys, and causes them to perform more poorly on tests than young girls of similar academic talent.
Much of the research on gender stereotypes and stereotype threat in education (mainly MSE) also examines testing, and how different environmental and psychological cues affect scores of people who may experience stereotype threat. For example, it has been shown that discussing or announcing scientific facts about gender stereotypes to females before a test affects their score (Dar-Nimrod 2006). If you tell them that they generally do not perform as well as men, they will experience the effects of stereotype threat, and not perform well. But, when some women were told that the latter was not true regarding the specific test being used in the experiment, women did not feel as pressured or stressed from stereotype threat, and they performed much better (VIDEO). Additionally, research has shown that stereotype threat has an effect even before test taking, when the content is being taught (Appel 2012). Students who are part of negatively stereotyped groups tend to be less focused and less motivated, causing lower rates of retention and mounting on the already existing effects of stereotype threat on test scores.
Distancing from children and young adults in education, we will now discuss the effect of genders stereotypes on adults in the workplace, and in sales, both on the company side and on the consumer side. From the examination of the research that has been done on gender stereotypes, it appears that gender stereotypes are less of an issue in this population than in educational contexts, but while this is the case they are still significantly pervasive in adults.
*sigh
250 more words to go
then i have to mla format it
Your essay is bad
You barely covered gender stereotypes on men
You portray that such things do not exist
Its by words?
yes
Therefore your essay is problematic and skewed
you barely researched this
I don't need to research my life
And what I notice
yes, this isnt about you, ramesh
Yes but this isn't about me
This is about observations regarding other people
look stereotype threat affects women more than it does men
also
also
Cap
Cap
je suis d'accord
cap
Stereotype: men don’t cry
Stereotype: men are strong
interestingly though, despite stereotypes disassociating females with MSE in education, studies show that at a young age, children believe that girls are academically superior to boys (Hartley 2013). They also found that, just like with women in MSE, this stereotype induces stereotype threat in young boys, and causes them to perform more poorly on tests than young girls of similar academic talent.
^
Stereotype: men only want s**
There are a lot of men stereotypes that affect them harshly
now you see
^
i am studying the environmental/social/societal effects of gender stereotypes
Also men and mental health
not the interpersonal
Yep
or psychologiacal
or ethical
Are we just circle jerking about how bad we are judged initially?
For being men
Lmao
cy is going to change the subject
to a fun font he found
called Circular Std Book
Much needed
FontForge

hi my name is cy
its nice to meet you
Hello cy
i prokraston8
Huh
Who would figure
IkRite
ShopRite
k im done now
with that
Yes plz do ur essay
Its killing me inside
guhbye
uhmmm cy
when reading ur essay
form having a debate background and having reacherched topics such at this one
yes
?
ur argument is extremely flawed and from what I see is based off of hypotheticals and not concrete facts
like its a good paper and all
its not an argument tho
that's whats weird
about ap seminar
its an objective overview
still, in the overview of the topic that you are presenting
btw that's not the whole essay
you should not have the majority of your evidence and reasoning for such be off of senerios and not auctual events
thats like 80% of the essay that you read
yes
so about this
i am researching specifically the "environmental" lens
or situational
or like
the environment ppl are in
and i have to use research
which is experimental
ik what you're thinking
cuz like
u do deb8
where like
ppl needa be convinced
and hypothetical situations dont convince ppl
like you say that girls prefer a environment that is non homogenous
yes
in that you are not presenting and issue, if anything that is considered an annoyance
well it is reporting on my research
idk
you see
Since it became widely available, abortion has been a large topic of debate for people of different cultures and beliefs. It has brought about great conflicts, due to the widely varying views of the issue (Solinger). On one side of the abortion argument, are people who believe that getting an abortion should be the choice of the mother, and not the choice of any governing or religious party. They believe that the health and social/emotional wellbeing of the mother is most important. Many of them also believe that an unborn fetus, especially in earlier stages of development, is not to be considered alive, and that it will not feel any pain if its development is aborted (Frost). On the other side of this argument is the antiabortion or pro-life argument, which argues for the criminalization of abortion. Many of these people are religious and/or believe that life starts at conception (Thomhave). They believe that, for this reason, an abortion, which kills the fetus, is an act of murder. These people believe that their beliefs should apply to everyone, thus their intent to criminalize it. 
But, alongside the existence of these two sides, there exists a large middle ground. According to an investigation by B. J. Rye and Angela Underhill, most people, in fact, take a middle position, of which there are two (Rye). One of the middle positions they describe is the “dilemma” position. People who take this position are against abortion themselves, but they believe in the right to choice – knowing that there are people who do not share the same views as them. The other main middle ground position described is the “regulated” position. These people are for abortion – they would get one or suggest one in appropriate conditions, but they believe that abortion should be heavily regulated and controlled. Neither of these positions can really be characterized into pro-life or pro-choice, since they both have an opposing opinion and legislative factor, resulting in a total of 4 discrete positions that most people’s opinions on abortion could be categorized into. 
As Elizabeth Porter explains, like many controversial issues, abortion is a complex topic that requires considering the problem from many different perspectives in order to fully understand it. Legislature that properly deals with the problem and satisfies the most people must be created by people who understand it properly (Porter). Major areas of concern with regards to Abortion include but are not limited to ethics, science, health, and government. 
Abortion laws, given their name, are an issue greatly revolving around the government. In 1970, the Roe v Wade supreme court case occurred. This case, arguably the most important event in the history of abortion law in the US, set an especially important precedent for future abortion-related discussion. This case resulted in a decision that the constitution of the United States gave the people, through their right to privacy, the right to a healthy abortion without restrictions from the federal government. This case and its result, despite their age, are still being discussed and fought over today. Additionally, during this time, parties took sides on the abortion debate. During this time, republicans, seeking support from religious citizens, adopted a pro-life stance (Williams). This, as intended by the republican party, did end up attracting many religious people and resulted in the Republican party overall taking a pro-life stance (Williams), which they still mainly hold today. On the contrary, democrats today tend to take up a more pro-choice stance. With almost every democrat-republican debate today, pro-choice versus pro-life comes up. 
In addition to the governmental aspects of the abortion debate, there are also many ethical, health-related, and social/cultural concerns with regards to abortion. As stated earlier, religion is one of the biggest drivers of the pro-life movement. Abortion does not comply with many, if not most religious laws and restrictions (Frost). This primarily stems from many religious beliefs that life b
egins at conception (Frost), and that therefore, killing a fetus at any point constitutes the murder of a living human. Many scientific studies though, have found that, especially in developing countries, access to safe abortion procedures plays a large part in bettering women’s health (Berer). For many women, an abortion may be desired or required to an extent that, regardless of laws or policies, the woman will go to whatever lengths neccesary to get one. This, especially in developing countries as mentioned before, ends up with many women getting abortions in illegal, and often highly unhealthy ways that could cause serious health problems or death (Berer). 
Overall, the debate over abortion rights and restrictions is a heavily present part of our modern society. While it is not clear that we will settle on correct laws and procedures any time soon, a lot of research is being done on this topic, with the aim of helping facilitate the correct decision.
that got a 92
im read it one sec
also like i said what you read was 80% of revision alpha 1
like
the first draft is due wednesday
so from what I understand
you have to present bolth sides of an argument
and just say a controversy exists  here
right
well so
theres an issue
with lenses
perspectives
contexts
and populations
we are supposed to research these
for this assignment
each group member
is doing a different lens
then
after we research
we review the different perspectives, populations, and contexts
and write an Individual Research Report (IRR)
then
as a group
we create a team presentation
discussing a solution we came up with
that addresses all the different aspects of the issue
that we each studied
this is the IRR
ok so you are just presenting the single side
ooo
but still
well
the single lens
your argument is flawed
but what is my arguement
that girls are being pressured to not go  into academically rigorous fields
right
i mean i guess if you put it that way
yes
one half of my IRR
discusses the issues females face in education
due to stereotype threat
so what im saying is that the evidence that you present to back that up
is not based on concreate facts and is merely objectave
in like a constructively criticly way
but its an "objective overview"
so like
ooooooo
here hold on
then y u no present the male side
cuz ur only doing an overview of the female perspectave
well
no
so
i mean
the thing is
its not a vs thing here
unlike abortion
that one was like
choice vs life
whereas this is different
its not like ppl are arguing for stereotype threat
so in this case
there are not really perspectives
its more like populations
so you read the part about children and young adults in education
the other population i discuss after that is adults in business, sales, consumerism, and finance
idk this is ap seminar
nothing makes sense
but this approach worked last time
i gtg to watch 40 mins of history video
bye
i will meet with the teacher tho
cuz like
yall are telling me my essay is bad
so imma talk to mr y
just
change
it
so your thesis
only talks about "gender stereotypes on women"
then you acknowledge that it's only one side and that's all they expect
sums up ycombinator perfectly
tell me what the "sides" are that you propose
gender stereotypes on men
when it comes to stereotype threat
gender stereotypes on women
research shows that stereotype threat, especially in MSE domains, is only present in women
when it comes to gender
please remind me what MSE stands for
Math Science Engineering
Not necessarily
Didn't you say in your essay
that "men assume women are better at math than men"
no
i
what did you say then
I
"interestingly remarked"
that
Oh
young children
saw girls as academically superior
what if
they are
which makes male performance drop
they are not neccesarily, but stereotype threat can cause effects on boys in this scenario
therefore
can you say "only affects women"
but that is not neccesarily true
it is necessarily true
I believe that many people I know would agree
that it negatively affects males
Look
i am going to school
I'm sure you can find studies
that prove the other point as well
please find me studies
Yeah see if you're not willing to look at the other side modify your thesis
that works well
look im just reporting on my research
and my research showed that this is an issue for women
well I mean other than your research you should probably extend that and see if there are discrepancies
idk imma talk to the teacher
idk what he wants
Yeah you should bring this up with him
I have to go now
bye
bye
the python file above will do it for you just run a few instances of it

How did they reject him

frankly
i think its their fault
the art school
somehow he made it, yet the rejected him cause they were “unsatisfactory:
Maybe
that like
everything happened as it did
maybe
if he went to art school
imagine a timeline where he was an artist
he would not have become the worlds most hated creature
America would be broke then
i mean someone else would have
Stalin would have
idk
Communism would have spread like wild fire
yea that is true
Cuz America was no longer strong

북한인
North Korean

Ramesh used my bot

how do you do transliteration
instead of translation
transliteration
like say "bukhan-in" instead of "north korean"
it's like
writing arabic
yes
in roman characters
or
writing english
in Arabic characters
or chinese in pīnyīn
yea
or writing
which im gonna start doing
engilsh
in korean
once i learn the Arabic characters

I like to learn the language and I was learning Japanese, but I started learning Korean because it was easier.

Meiner Schlange ist die größte in der Weld
oh
i can guess what that means
and it is not very mature is it
Ah echt jetzt?
Was ist ,,jetzt"
Now
Oh really now?
Yes
Oh really esy
größte probably means largest
and Schlange well I think it refers to 음경
see the problem with Arabic is like
its both a different language
aa
and a different alphabet
Yeah well
it doesn't have vowels right
the abjad
tbh idk what it has
So you have to guess all the vowels
based on patterns
i think it kinda has vowels
like
here hold on
diacritics
like

I wasn't going to get that
the best website
you can even
and
which you may
I think I watched this before
I might buy a mac later
it just depends what others are doing
i want $25 off my mac m2
same
fun fact
Amazon makes their own CPUs
they're a diy company
except
instead of making smart plugs themselves like me
they make their own processor architectures
and logistics distribution networks
some of the worlds most expensive things to do yourself
oooooooooo
cuz vertical integration
it makes aws more efficient
then if you add that to not caring about the environment, workers, or privacy
it creates low cost
and results in monopolization
i dont like amazon
they are bad for everyone except me
but i dont like them
bc i have empathy for others
its
firefox
you know
how i feel
about firefox
at least firefox is not bad for society like amazon is
the government needs to cause amazon's agar blob to hit a spike ball
and demonopolize
google is mostly ok
they seem to care a bit more abt ppl and environment
and Microsoft is good bc they support open source and they also seem to care to a certain extent abt ppl and environment
and apple needs to be cornered by the Europeans into creating good stuff
since the əmərəcəns won't do it
really the Europeans kinda have to force everyone to do what theyre told
theyre the only ones that can
apple
needs to be split
?
it is
larger
than amazon
Yea and
and making society worse
Is it
If u think about it
Apple only grew this large because of society
imessage
is a scourge on society
and this isn't because I don't have it
I do
Society adopted imessage
I agree imessage sucks
But somehow this happened
yeah I know
the thing is
it's ethically wrong
What is
Imessage is ethically wrong?
Or do you mean just apple in general
imessage is
because
by using something that is locked to one platform
you're effectively hindering society's communication
See i would agree, but no one is forcing someone to buy an iphone
Right but you are forced to
if everyone you know uses imessage
Yea thats valid
Like you could say "switch"
but people won't
cuz they're stupid
Ok hold up
Switching isnt the easiest thing for people
for me it would be
For u sure
since like
But for many other prob not
I don't have a lot of friends
yeah
thus imessage is bad
and unethical
because it prevents user choice
I mean im on an iphone and dont use i message anymore
Im split between telegram and whatsapp
Yeah
I don't use imessage
but like
I know a lot of people who do
and only use imessage
and know of no other messaging platform
Really?
Thats kinda weird
basically
just
every girl
Huh
plus some others
and I don't think I'm making a gender stereotype here
Ur prob not
I have to add a few more nuances
but it's mostly true
Yea
like white people probably
and ones that don't play video games
since those use Discord
Imessage doesnt have the best features
Yea
Discord is nice
Discord isn't very bad actually
Yup if u have a use case for it
yeah well
all my friends other than you guys use it
but I kinda like telegram more
the UI is more
uhm
fun
yea telegram is nice
whatsapp is also not too bad
I won't use it
since it's facebook
ehh idrc
I thought telegram is a literal clone of whatsapp
idk i just use it for groupchats
uh i have to take a quiz today in ap classroom
it has a lot of features
i dont wanna
but its bad
cuz of how unoptimized it is
I just use it because other people use it
and I can too
i think thats just u
Yeah
no
i run discord 24/7
the lag in the voice calls
it's just you
is so bad
ok i was on a call with calum
I saw a Hacker News comment
and it was like
setting up mediawiki
"linux is not meant for people who want detailed sensory feedback"
he was connected to my pc via quick assist
Thus cy
also elementary OS is getting macOS touchpad gestures
which is
and talking to me over discord
interesting
the audio of him typing over discord
i mean thats ur wifi
was literally a second behind
He probably has ethernet
the remote desktop connection
cy are you paying attention
thats def just u, cause discord is used by many people
Yeah
idk idrc
and its known for its good audio and stuff
this thing he does not be noticed by me
yea but like
discord is generally the only place when ppl cant hear me
idk
discord doesn't work well for me
Yeah well
and its electron
I only use discord for DMs
like
elecrtron is bad
direct messaging
yeah
also
wdym groups are literally the only good feature
lemme show you something cy
telegram uses
an enormous amount of ram
yeah but its not as slow and buggy as discord
how am I using 12 gigs of ram
and i use unigram
it is a bit buggy on linux
meh
im tired
very tired
i woke up like
20 minutes ago
imagine
ive been awake since 5
i went to bed at 00:45
oof
u should sleep better
i was really awake tho
i was doing my hours of math
imessage is not a problem for the world
not like amazon is
i message is irrelevant
its a business strategy
and its legitimate
imessage is an unethical business strategy
and prevents competition
thus must be killed
no it doesnt
well hold up
i message is not anticompetitive
imessage is exclusive
yes
thats something different
no
because of its nature
and that is legitimate
Xbox and Sony do the same thing
its exclusivity
makes it anticompetitive
since it is a key communication tool
what is anticompetitive
is apple music
no
Sony has exclusive games, and so people have to buy a PS to get it
and app store purchases
and it wouldn't matter if it's restrictive
with 30%
since it's not an essential service
and the inability to tell users about it
that is anticompetitive
but really
its not like
amazon
amazon
kills
imessage is bad, but its a good buisness strategy
companies
the environment
mistreats workers
wants to take over the world
apple
also wants to do the same
but not in an anticompetitive way
in a way that makes people believe
it's not anticompetitive
its really only theyre software to a certain extent
their
cygh
im really tired
i typed their the first time
then erased it
and typed theyre

my phone is burning me

imma see why its burning me
iphones are perfect

20% per hour
screen off
wtf is this
i really want aod
it was so hot this morning
it was like
at least in a case
i would have been startled
to pick it up from the sides
at that time of day
U dont understand how hot they can get
it wasnt even charged
it was at like 85%
on the charger
charging
someone must have installed a botnet virus on my phone
hmmm
maybe it was me
sounds about right
Voidity
wants to chat
now known as tsurai
ah yes voidity
apple man
yeah
except i don't use that account
since I used it to circumvent this thing where I blocked someone on my account
so I could talk to him there
but I blocked him there as well
its not like my xiaomi
whos thermal pad
was not installed correctly
so instead of getting hot
it just got slow
and then it fried its gpu
damn
Nice
Ramesh used a capital N
why
what is it doing
idfk
i dont like samsung
they like
get apple
im telling you
and then get some airpods
i want google pixel
they are magical
but they do not offer 256g storage
i also do
so im stuck with samsung
my friend has the pixel 5, its so nice
if i want stuff that is good
why do u need so much?
yes im sure
so is the surface laptop
ive been using 64
but it doesn't have thunderbolt
Aryan has a pixel 5
are you friends with aryan
yea
how friends
like game together and hang out friends
Are you in his discord
where you vc with him
throughout the day
my problem with the galaxy is that its small and powerful
like Andy Pei
nope
so it drains
drains
i dont usually do that
i was friends with him
Yeah same
at some point
my friend does that
Yeah I have lost a few friends this year
and I gained a few
eg. Akhil
my Samsung is too hot
you see i want a bigger phone
with a bigger battery
i do not
this small phone
if the cpu goes to max
its draining
at like 50% per hour
I might just go read rhythm of war
but like
cuz the battery is so small
Yeah well
get an iphone
owie it hurts
they are
premium
and not junk
its
louis
i bet ur samsung is gonna explode
rossmann
the owie test
louis rossmann has
interesting political views
louis rossmann is one of those new yorkers
whos like
you know
he has a superiority complex
idk if he "conceales failure" tho
yes
but he has a superiority complex
and
the viewers
blindly believe him
i dont
I don't
"racism isn't real"
i dont watch him so
define real
can i hold it no
does it exist yes
yeah
but like
louis rossmann
louis rossmann thinks racism
is interesting
is not real
idk
i never heard him say that
huh
I am pretty sure
i hear him talk about other things
ive never watched any of his videos
lemme see some later
i care more about macbook repair
than politics
from him
im not interested in his politics
k i gotta pay attention now
idk how to use the debugger
bye
adios
i wont
akhil read the story
i did
entirely?
yea
its a page and a half
whaddya think of it
its intresting
its good
like
what were the three words
it tackles intresting topics
probably cause he hates love I love you
yeah
or the opposite I hate you
no it's I love you
yea expected
like
how do you think the flaying scene happens
he has PTSD from it
hmm
see heres what im wondering, is he hurting himself, or was that his parents?
that was his parents
I think
it was implied
yea it was
because like
just wanted to make sure
"at my face"
implies it
so someone else is doing it
i mean u prob could so it to yourself
yeah but like also
wait
Okay I will try to make that more clear
so its because he said 3 words
three other people know
and going by the topic of love
what does that tell you
out of how many?
other than him
three other people know of the deed
ah so his parents and someone else
he prob said I love “them”(whoever he loved)
uh
then why would the parents tell the other person
after
whipping him
and leaving him
hmmm
then i kinda dont know what they are
he just
tells someone
else
"I love YOU"
then she tells his parents
and then they wip him, what is she his sister?
no
they
dont let him
explore his sexuality
huh
this sounds similar
to?
this sounds kinda similar to someone i know
hrngm

any bets on when ridge will reach 100 units in school
?
im betting around early february
for what
these airpods max
im saying march
when will 100 students have them
actually late feburary
yeah actually imma go there too
but y
y r they 500$
cuz appow
they are legit airpods pro
loard appow
yet double
they are over ear headphones
i can get qc 35 for 200
why would i get these ugly headphones
cuz appow
loard appow
at least bose can actually be used in a professional enviroment
these cant
are they Bluetooth only
think so
why would they have a jack
the phones dont even have a jack
the only thing that looks decent on the headphones are the pads
the maks do
id say mid feb
its bluetooth only
H1 chip
Idfc
its garbage
litteral garbage
idk the lack of headphone jack
is a dealbreaker
at $500
yea i would want one
yeah
not for
this is for consumers
greg gardener
that chip and anc and apples eq is not usable for professionals
gweg wikes appow
this is, as reddit quotes “For Dads on Airplanes"
im sure they sound amazing
and the anc is really good
but like
idk
anc is good
but idk how they r gonna do it this time
they are ecosystem locking
also you wanted to know
what did i want to know
no akhil
kaladin gets a VERY small amount of romance in rhythm of war
hmm
thats fine
im expecting more tho
i have a few ships
but i dont think they will work
i need to read the books so i can get more szeth
oh you will
k imma go back to reading
bye
they r the same as the airpods pro
adios
get a 3070
yup
nope
it doesn't work in vms
although
this is about the most obvious vm environment
literally windows sandbox
oh i know how they figure out
ha they knew i would try compatibility mode next
I figured out how software detects if its in a vm
how
well the most obvious way would be when it gets the hardware serial number
hardware model
or manufacturer
well i mean
on windows
windows already knows for you
see the "Virtual Machine: Yes" property
in task manager
yea
so this will not be the solution
hmm
idk what im trying to do
run it in a vm?
hmm
we're gonna do wine on linux
in a vm
hmm
it installed
and didn't say it wouldnt run
but it doesn't seem to be working
meh imma stop trying to hack the software
u need some fancy wine config
yes do hw
i did the reading during lunch
so i have some time
good job
i am listening to a guys and dolls song
and i like it
its my favorite one
im listening to jazz
this is somewhat jazzy
its sorta 50s-y
i like 50s music
nah hard rock, rock and jazz
those r good
ehh
ehh what
not to my taste
idk ur taste
u like
listened to
what was it
Paradise by Bazzi
and
um
See those r what pops up in the Daily mixes
spotify?
yea
yeah i listen to that too
i wanna make a playlist that plays on my website
if you click play
......
but the goddamn DMCA is getting in my way
yea i was gonna say
they only let it play 30 seconds of songs if the user is not signed in
so i could try and identify whether the spotify cookie is saved
and if it is
enable the player
otherwise display a sign in message
here hold on
all the music services have embedded players
deezer though goes into depth
on what happens
the problem is
i dont want ads
or 30s limits
and i dont want some random mix
smloadr is a thing
but imma not do that
cuz like
DMCA
is gonna sue me
now
interestingly
i could use youtube
you can embed YouTube playlists
and as far as i know they dont have ads
and are legal
they dont?
idk imma see rn
hold on
asdflkajsdhflaksjdfhlaskdjfha
what is it
with this
music does not appear in embedded players
huh
like
it doesn't work
quick question, whats one reason the amish are more likely to sruvive the next century
huh thats weird
um
because they survived the last
*clapping*
Genius
now i will figure out a way to embed music in my website
just wait
well actually here was another option
livestream it
like have a stream server
that http streams audio
oo that would be cool
and then the website picks it up
then
technically
i am not breaking DMCA
cuz
im not letting ppl pick what they wanna hear
its not on demand
well hold up
yes i could break dmca to make this all easier
isnt that the same thing with Twitch and DMCA and that whole ordeal
idk
dont know about that
cause streamers were playing music
i dont use twitch
i dont either
but it was a big thing
yes
this one is good
is sending a video
cy is adding music streaming
*cygh
u have cool thingy
u have >> instead of ...
i have awdio
its not there yet
it will be soon
hmm
it has not been pushed
it better be high res
i also need a server to host the audio
its not bad
i also need to rip all the audio files
itss OGG Vorbis
whatever that means
People
are walking on my roof
which is distracting
what a strange song title
its not a bad song i think
Look I just need to finish this part
I'm only like 10 pages away
yes and i need to rethink my minecraft username
xxAkiruxx
Hell no
XxItsAkhilXx
i...
no
Itsakh
Saeai
alright
so
you do not understnad
how f-ing annoying
it is
my audio stream to my website
otherwise browsers wont load it
and not only do I have to encrypt it
certificate
uhalsdukfhasldkfbqowieubfoiasudybcaosdifasdflkjh
anyway
click radio
and tell me if you hear "Campfire" by Retrovision on repeat
I hear
nothing
wdym
I hear
no sound
0
is the button grey
or white
Neither
do I hear it in chrome
it is white
idk lemme try firefox
ha it doesn't work in firefox
yeah just so you know
it doesn't work in chrome either
oh
now it does
this music is awful
yes ik
but does it play
yes
also
make it work in firefox
see that little icon
it means "No, Cy. I will not function for you."
I changed
it
to autoplay
now it plays but no audio comes
oh now it does
suggestion
if you have a radio
make it
say
what song
is playing
wait its not working in my firefox
try it a few times
it works for me
hold on
k so chrome should work now no issue
well hold on
Firefox already works fine
I havent pushed changes
but I am disabling blur
not for me
the blur feature is broken and it hurts my eyes
not your fault
yeah
it works fine for me
Try f5-ing to clear cache or something
my firefox is throwing this error
Mine is not
audioOption.style.pointerEvents = "all";
    }
    var toggleSpeed = 0.25;
    function toggleAudio() {
      if (audioPlaying) {
        playicon.innerHTML = "play_arrow"
        fadeOut('audioplayer', toggleSpeed);
        audioPlaying = false;
      }
      else {
        playicon.innerHTML = "stop"
        fadeIn('audioplayer', toggleSpeed);
        audioPlaying = true;
      }
    }
    function fadeOut(audiosnippetId, time) {
      var sound = document.getElementById(audiosnippetId);
      sound.volume = 1;
      var fadeAudio = setInterval(function () {
        sound.volume -= 0.1;
        if (sound.volume <= 0.1) {
          clearInterval(fadeAudio);
        }
      }, 100 * time);
    }
    function fadeIn(audiosnippetId, time) {
      var sound = document.getElementById(audiosnippetId);
      sound.volume = 0;
      var fadeAudio = setInterval(function () {
        sound.volume += 0.1;
        if (sound.volume >= 0.9) {
          clearInterval(fadeAudio);
        }
      }, 100 * time);
    }
oh
you're using a stream
yes
or are you
i am
because DMCA
Interesting
firefox is being finnicky
it works the first time
but if you reload it stops working
it works again
it works very well for me
idk
you're the only one who uses firefox
you like
so that's good
reload it once
moving on
oh it randomly greys out
why don't you
make it not grey out
if I want to listen to it
I will do
its supposed to grey out if the stream is down
which will likely end up being the case
for a while
that feature seems to be broken
not in chrome
imma change the music
to something better
than Campfire by Retrovision
on repeat
Lemme check
Greyed out
a;sdlkfja;sdlkfjas;dlkfj
what is the error
in the console
take a screenshot
and try in chrome too
Nice one
Edge works
k
works flawlessly in edge
what is the error in safari
i was gonna say that
lemme check in safari
safari and firefox are not working
this was the firefox error
um see about that
safari has no error
have fun
tf
this is funny
the console has nothing
greyed out in safari
wdym
what
what is the issue
in safari
smooth scrolling no exist
yea
ik
stop using safari
thats the solution
no
that is not a solution
for
greg gardener
you see there are 2 ways to make a website
the compatibility way
and the nice way
and this
is the nice way
oh btw
what
snap scrolling no work in edge
um
yes it does
unless you are in mobile mode
um i thinl
for safari no error messages pop up, so i did some digging
yes...
oh
it doesn't work the same
how do you enable the developer console in safari
it may have to do with the fact that it took 701 ms to do something
um
see I am more adept than akhil
clearly
so just tell me how to enable developer tools
i mean
the audio
i already have that open
will download forever
so idk
yeah but like how do you open it
I know they hide it
go to preferences
okay
then u gotta go to advanced
then the button for develop mode will be there
click
then go to menu bar
bam developer mode
so in safari
def
def there
am I blind
it shows the stop button
but no audio
the last thing
says develop
ah yes
im stupid
ty
this?
or is it greyed out
or i just stop being an idiot
wait
i can get safari on linux
grey
oh grey
hmm
i think its the same as the firefox issue
which i cant figure out
works fine
in webkit
this is quite weird
it is on and off
send me the firefox error
and Ramesh seems to not encounter issues
This is linux "safari"
but it only
Yea same as me
like
oh it loads forever
it only happens when you reload
it works the first time
then stops working
when you reload
in firefox
nothing in mac safari
for me
yea thats what i said
it works okay in firefox
better than mac safari
why is this so annoying
it works in epiphany tho
imma have to add
another compatibility message
to solve this problem
safari its just loading forerver
I have to scan my apush notes
like forever forever
yep same on epiphany
but not on REAL safari
see i should do those now
im on REAL safari
its also just loading forever
*sigh
just
use
chrome
no.
why
do people
use
safari uses less battery life
not chrome
on macbooks
^
like
and its synced with my passwords
you care about that
then base safari on blink
when ur plugged in
give google a monopoly
or
I can somewhat support safari
make a consortium
no
that exists
cuz this is ridiculous
it's called the w3c
they're not good enough
clearly
yeah uh huh
now heres a question
akhil
also the safari might be greyed out on mine
in safari
since mac over vnc sucks
yeah blame the consortium
akhil
yea
in safari
go to the console
and type
mhm
Right I wouldn't be able to tell you
wait
nope
if i go downstairs
it might play lol
*sigh
not supported operation
what
hold on
what is this
ramesh
what
explain
why
doesn't work in the console
in safari
it returns nothing
does it change the play button to a stop button
yes
yes
but its greyed out
nto for me
It does nothing for me
what is this
what
how
idk i need to do hw
;lkasjdf;lkasdj;flkajsd;flkajs;dlfkasdjf;alksdf;alskdfjasdf
why
it's a mac
is this
failing
it's perfect
whats more important spanish or apush notes
apush
see but i dont wanna do notes
exactly
apush
thats why
you should do it now
did you read my story cy
yea
no
i can
later
right now
it's like
one page
imma change the audio file
and see my parents
at dinner
oh lol
ofc it's vlc
what is ofc
Of course
i see
this is icecast
with vlc
whatever works
works.
no i mean mpv doesn't do this stuff anyway so it's fine
hmm even if i change the user agent it no work
also my header bar
has blur
oo fancy
cool
i have to deal with that
wack os
time to do notes fast
1-2 notes every page
notes
every page
oh
that is awful
I had 10 pages
mine usually come out to around 8 or so
yes ofc
the only things I can find is that it is possibly carcinogenic
nice one spanish teacher
haha
spanish sucks
actually I found it later on
who cares if I use wikipedia
i wanna download the entire wikipedia
seems like a good idea
its like 80gb supposedly
and i kinda wanna self host it
Why tho
Also thats probably only the text
The images have to be more than 80 gb
no its everything
So you're telling me
like 100 gb for the entire wikipedia
u can look it up
Wikipedia runs on a 100gb ssd
its not a lot
ah compressed
thats still fine
100gb compressed for all of wikipedia
ill take that
It's 10tb uncompressed
Imma eat dinner bye
adios
I might make a new wiki
for my constructed world
like coppermind
since im making a constructed world
hmm
if u want to
i mean it would be cool
Yeah like if mediawiki were sane
I'll write my own wiki software in rust
ez
nice
I hate english
like
the language
it gets really ambiguous
UGH i hate english
I think I might do the unthinkable and buy apple stock
Uh hold on
I mabye watch the news first
The new headphone got released todays
Those r gonna sway market opinion
yea to apple
like with airpods
Really?
yuh, even if they trash, they are marketed like gods
All the things ive seen are leaning away
Cause of their price
yea, ppl are dumb
michael
does it have bocelli
no
it has like
10 songs
ok, but apple
if there is market volume i would do it
also with arm
they hav big leap forward
i havent seen any charts so i wouldnt know
but yea u could buy
they gonna hav 32 core m3
check volume first
in 2022
ooo
yea, market volume is gonna b crazy
cuz all things are online
im expecting it to be
so apple is perfect bc ecosystem
whats the stock price rn for apple?
124
its good
hmm, yea thats good
id wait till tmrw and buy like 5-10 shares
if u can ofc
im not gonna buy yet
lemme see some charts
I wanna see what happens to the headphones
ah so around the 16-20th
yuh
also with election, im trying to dump like industry stocks
ooo
and go more consumer electronics
yea u might as well
yea, I only own a bit of amd
and thats it
apples actually a decent stock to get
its gone up this month
yea, Im thinking to put a couple of grand into it to see what happens
i should buy tezla
volatile
its cwazy
elon makes me money
if u r confident then yes
or
you can get the short shorts

well kind of
bruh
literally
elon make money
elon also kinda wack
cool
i got my streaming radio to work
i wanna learn how like the prossessers work to a level where i would be able to put them on bords
boards
they are not processors
they are microcontrollers
big difference
microcontrollers
have peripherals
which do most of the work
microprocessors
stm32 is not a microprosser
have processors
its a microcontroller
i did a dumb
its ok
you are learnin
We all do a dumb
well I will still have to learn how to do it
i wanna learn keil
keil uvision
What that?
over Christmas break im getting like big electronics workstation
Lucky
µvision
it is
a toolchain/IDE
its like a desk and some stuff
Lucky
but with that ima buy a cnc router
and try to mill my own bords
no
just
use
JLCPCB
$2
Hold up, buy or make
for a pcb
Plus shipping
shipping is like $6

Whats under the skull
i looked at said file
There is a unique function in the file

Uh
-5 can never become greater than 2 right?

it keeps throwing dictionary key errors
hello
nope
w w wait

Guys it snowed so hard my router broke. My dad is currently using an oil soaked piece of styrofoam as fuel to keep it warm and hopefully unfreeze it, talk to you later
where
what
how is
greg
should i come over
and help you
hahahashahaha
yeah if you can come to my house in 7 minutes and leave without infecting greg with covid-19
see im trying to understand why my code is dead
i think its telegram
who is no longer sending messages to it
But like
it died only after I did the zalgo
yeah
but
why
am i not seeing any new messages coming in
Zalgo
that's why
hello
no
Ha
i think
its cuz
hold on
hmm
somehow it just doesn't get messages from this channel anymore
but it does
i should buy
stocks
i wanna buy boeing
bc everyone hates them
for no reason
they are gonna not be bad
Thats why u dont buy it
no
i forgot to mention
Yes so unless something changes that
bc max 10
and
Like a new plane or development
xe
Then sure go ahead
bc covid
but
xej xaxa
covid will end
and
max 10
may become
the safest
boeing
aircraft
ever
to fly
if you only count the time after the accidents
How do you think
idk
should i obfuscate my website's js
I mean if u want

my icons
asd;flkja;sdlkfj
dammit windows
ah right i remember now
the icons disappear when i run out of ram
cuz windows thinks theyre unimportant
now why
is
then stop using so much ram
also i dont wanna study for chemn
who the f
is using 43gb of ram
what
is this
i cant even use my clipboard
to send screenshots anymore
who
alright so what i have 4 different browsers open
thats only like 6gb of ram
how
43gb committed
there it finally did a screenshot
hmm
well
i could just expand my swap
that would solve the issue
....
i could also add a compatibility message
I do not understand how u use like 43 gb of ram
me neither
At most like ive used 15 gb
how to solve all problems
Sure
see im not actually running that much
*cough
actually
thats not true
What did we do this chapter in chem?
Balancing
Limiting v excess
Percent yield
Wtf
U know u should close things right
Like when ur done with them
i should ask for more ram for christmas
i should not close things
U should not not close things
the problem is that like
now my taskbar is running out of space too
so i need a wider monitor
.......
Windows vertical tabs?
windows has a vertical mode
except
its awful
bc you have to click the little arrows
alternatively i could use multiple desktops
imma increase my swap
Sure go ahead
ow oops
i just set my swap to 32 megabytes
just add a couple orders of magnitude...
nice
now it wants me to restart
but
guess what
my icons are back
so as far as i see
nice
this is a win
i still do not understand though
what is taking 43gb of memory
Balancing, Relationships, Yield, Limiting vs Excess reactants
look at the tasks
What ch 4 in chem is for the test
i think its all that
it must be nginx
ah i see the prob now
what
its not one thing thats taking up a lot
43 gb akhil
its a bunch of “smaller” ones
more than half of the small ones are under 10mb
then yeah its prob nginx
hmm
so does this mean
nginx does things with memory?
what is it doing
caching a literal audio stream?
maybe its using the memory for compression
ik compression uses a lot of memory
wanna listen to some electro swing
oh it ended
now its Young Hearts by BUNT. ft BEGINNERS
this is what my code would be obfuscated
tf
"Sound is using your microphone"
is this electro swing
it is not
although it approaches
what genre is that
idk
pop/electronic
jawn rə
no
idk my jonrəs
жawnrə
wait
i can type this in arabic
gimme a few minutes
جارا
o right
that broke
HA
hmm
gaara
well
close
i literally have no clue wtf happened to my translatebot
it works fine if you dm it
Gvprtskvni

wow its such good music
the silence man
how they did that
fantastic
are you still listening
there is no music
but does it play
like did you open it in chrome
i did not
open it in chrome
and listen
huh
HaHA
Jesus dude
Hi
si
but why
Imagine if this was prerecorded
so see, i hear this creepy as heck noise
its like when ceramic hits each other
Cyception?
ok but you have to say that the keyboard sounds nice over that mic
yea
its nice
i like it
my keyboard does not sound like that in person
ha "cy is typing"
you can literally hear it
yeah mines also pretty good
yea its creepy
ok so hold on
so
would you like to try something
wut
you take the mic
and i listen
how?
k so hold on a moment i have to port forward
actually its already port forwarded
lemme try something now
ill give u instructions in a moment
alright i guess i willl be listening to u keyboard
yea
imma try it on my pc first
then imma send to u
u have vlc installed
?
nope
install
while my computer is being slow and not booting
im hearing a loop of the things
you shouldn't hear anything anymore
its dead
why
is vlc not opening
idk
im downloading rn
its working now
imma try my settings
wait
no way
hold on
ok vlc is open
what
hmm
well its streaming
from my laptop
but
its not being picked up
wait hold on
ik why i think
so i can delete vlc
no
cause is bad software
leave it
for a moment
YES
its working
its working
yes it is
ok
lemme tell u what to do
open vlc
ok
media>stream
uh wut
*sigh
screenshot
i lost you on the first step
oh ur in that mode
get out of that mode
also
dont u have mak with top bar
that has menus
how
is there a media menu
yea i found the convert/stream option
yea that
do that
ok then
what is this
that is not
what i expected
and i cant do quickassist
cuz ur on mak
hold on
um
well
its completely different on mac
um
do open media
oh wait
i did things
send skreenshot
this
yes
then set ur audio capture
to ur microphone
yea i did that
um
stream to where
then go to that settings thing
and send a screenshot
do type Icecast
and skreenshot
yea that option does not exist
what
what is this
mak
i no like mak
i no like vlc
well then u find a way to do this
hold on
essentially
you need to send OGG Vorbis audio data
to an icecast server
using the example.ogg mountpoint
this is a bit to complicated
well
in my vlc
theres an option
called icecast
you type those parameters
and it works
idk
i see nothing
akhil
theres this software
called
butt
broadcast using this something
i forgot
broadcast using this tool
butt
it works on mac
you can erase vlc
ok
k so butt is actually really easy to use
its really ugly
but it works
download
run
and send screenshot
this will work
k go to settings
ok
under main, server
click add
yea
give it some random name
icecast
port 8880
password hackme
mountpoint example.ogg
user source
then
ok
once done
click add
to close that box
ok
then under audio
set codec to OGG/VORBIS
bitrate?
128k
ok
under streaming
then go back to the main window
and click play
then send a screenshot
no
you clicked record
you need to click play
i dont think ur mic works
set your audio device in settings
stop
play
then screenshot
idk im not picking up a stream
and i see not level meters
like in mine\
make it so there are level meters
i think ur mic is blocked or dead
i did something
wait
i hear it
i hear it
oh
thats fine
i can still hear you
you know what would be fun
if ur website had the same thing
then we could talk
like rtc
but like not at all rtc
yes ik
whats the latency like
say something
that was like 12s
yes
like
but its high quality
you could use this for broadcasts though
like
ok...
im getting lost in latency
virtual disk 6 5 4 3 2 1
sure
mine sounds better
k so now open the stream on a speaker
to create the creepy echo
it is not complete
without the creepy echo
would you like
to listen to akhil
aw hes not there
and ur reaction is 12s delayed
this is so fun idk why
remember when like
you were small
and you tried to talk with friends
over walkie talkies
bc u didn't have a phone
its so fun waiting what seems like 30 seconds now
for u to respond
now all i need is this
but with video broadcasts
alright im starting to get a headache
may i get rid of the software now?
sure
but the quality was outstanding
and for how simple
this is
its like
handbrake?
no
icecast
give me your stream link
i wanna propose to my brothers piano teacher to use icecast
oh you wanna stream now
no
i wanna show you something
wdym
oh no
but its not live
well yes
but
404
um
yea
thats because
whatever
it's okay
this
just curious, where do yall store ur photos and stuff
what photos
any photos
like the ones i take?
yes
like camera photos
on google photos, OneDrive, nextcloud, and on my sd card
i should do that
i dont use my sd card that much anyway
no my phone sd card
ill take it from the rpi and put it on that
i dont use a camera much
yea idc
or ill put them in nextcloud
i finished studying for chem
its like 7 questions tmrw
and 3-5 parts
which is easy
the like
one
icecast broadcast client
for android
Looks so stupid
Make ur own
like the "quality level"
max kwalitee
-0.1
Oo
i could
I mean mine was like -0.5
but android and ios
are pain in the broadcast using this tool
(butt)
and if it works
it works
lowercase c
k
see i wanna get my brother's piano teacher to use icecast
for recitals
and more
cuz its so much better than zoom
and theres an ios app
thats really good
its literally
5 boxes for each of the params
and an on button
and i tried it
and it works
well
so each performer would simply type these things in
and then when it's their turn
they would click on
I mean theoretically they could
and the listeners would reload
you do not understand
how bad zoom is
with piano
its like
No i do
audible
and perceivable
My sister learns the piano
but
like
U know whats worse
The drums
On zoom
yeah
no
thats
yea
anyway
cuz right now my radio system is on a 90 day death timer
when my cert expires
and i dont know how to renew it
its probably just like certbot renew
but like
as if i will remember
Do ssl
i mean
it depends
the problem with ssl
is i need certbot to autorenew
and certbot is not fun
because
it requires access to port 80
Ah
so
either you stop ur server
Cant u send an email and it will renew?
no it actually needs to update everything
and re verify your authority
Ah
so either you stop ur server
let it update
then start your server
or
you use a plugin for your web server
that routes certain paths to certbot
which i could do
see
U could
i want an actual computer to run all this
my pi 4
just like
isnt fast enough
to run 4 web services
my global reverse proxy
2 mqtt servers
and an icecast server
First off nice
Second ummmmmmmm yea
I feel bad for ur pi
me too
but it has a fan
Second how do u do this?
I wanna make a reverse proxy
ok so
what do you perceive as my meaning of "global reverse proxy"
The thingy for email servers and stuff
its where all the requests go
they come in
they go there
then
they are routed
its sorta like
a router
but backwards
Isnt that just a normal proxy
yes
but
this is called a reverse proxy
i think
its because
its "clients"
are other servers
accepting inbound requests
sort of
its a 2 way proxy
like
Yea i get what ur saying
well
actually no
it does not place requests
to wherever you want
those are fixed
regardless of the name
this server
It receives them
yes
well but it also places them
on other servers on your network
but anyway
it takes everything that comes in
and sorts it
and reroutes it
and for the static stuff
it also acts as a web server
in fact
it can be your entire web server
like apache i believe
fyi
certbot autorenews
runs on nginx
yes
unless
something else is on port 80
idk about email yet
but you see
what would happen would be that like
did akhil start WoR
in addition to a global reverse proxy and static hosting server
there would be another server
responsible for hosting things
like web services
mqtt
icecast
telegram bots
loggers
are those running on the same ports
and stuff like that
yeah well then you just buy a server
I have a few for sale fyi
yes i know fmi
what does FMI mean
h
for my informaion
Ah intéressant
but i have a few issues
so you see
i want
to have nginx route
everything
from a port 443 request
to its intended server
so like
it passes everything including the ssl and encryption and everything
to the server
to
your mqtt server
that doesn't support encryption?
no
to my nextcloud server
so
i have a nextcloud server
with encryption
that is self-managing
and what i want
to be routed ssl and all
to that server
so the global reverse proxy does no ssl
that is just like
not how that works
i dunno
ive never done such a thing before
I manage ssl on my reverse proxy
it's slightly easier that way
see ramesh
how does certbot work for you
I think
what you want
is to port forward
not reverse proxy
yes
but no
bc that is what i have now
but i want multiple servers in my house on port 443 on my external port 443
also this
how does it autorenew
if your site is using port 80
I have no clue
I know on NixOS it uses like
a systemd timer
and then it kills your server?
for like
2 seconds
and then it restarts and works fine
hmm
but what if i have servers that cannot be killed
wdym
i guess you use the plugin
the plugin
also
ramesh
restarts nginx
no
it uses nginx to route special requests
to certbot
then
it autoupdates your nginx config
and reloads nginx
or restarts it
that is true
actually
that's what I mean
yeah so thats fine i guess
ok i have another question
so what if i have multiple servers on port 80 on one os
want to have*
you don't do that
but like
like you can't
what if i want 3 mqtt servers
on one computer
use
different ports
but what if i cant change the port
why
idk but what if i cant
then you like use VMs
i see
what about containerization
what is docker
no
please explain
docker doesn't
work like that
well regardless
what is it
actually i guess docker could work
docker is like it runs in a network that is only accessible to the local machine
and is more lightweight than vms
what does it do tho
like
it runs containers
how does it work
what is a container
a lightweight vm
like
it's not even a vm
it uses the host kernel
and just has like different files on top of it
what is not shared between containers
and you can run multiple
files
files
so its literally a folder
it's like
a rootfs
idk what that is ramesh
uh
it's the root filesystem
all the files contained in it at /
yes obviously
that's bad
yeah that's all it is I think
and then it runs those separately
so
hold on
with separate network
so it runs with a separate /
and its own netowrk
then you use docker
yes
to manage the network
and the ports
no
oh uh yes
i guess
what do you mean by manage network and ports
so you would use docker to "port forward"
requests to different containers
so each container would have an mqtt server
and then docker would route the ports
no
how would you even distinguish
which things to route to which server
like this
so
Yes
request would come into nginx
your
MQTT
request
comes into nginx
then nginx would route to a specific port
a port
based on the domain
then
a port
so this is like all one server
okay
an address:port
okay
then
at that address would be docker
and it would look at the port
"8001, oh, thats mq01"
then
See if thats what u want
docker
would route port 8001
yes
to port 8000
you can do that
on the respective container
Yes
I think you can do that
I'm pretty sure you can do that
^
Has everything u can and cannot do
So
so you can do
what i want to do
k
great
so now when should i choose vm over container
or container over vm
Isolation
A whole new os
give me an example
of when vm would be better
For when i wanna use kali linux on my mac
uhm
the reason you use a vm
no when container would be an option but vm would be better
is because docker is an annoying piece of garbage
it is ephemeral
what does this mean
it disappears
like
wdym
the data it has
disappears when it shuts down
why
so you need to allocate certain parts of it
to like have permanent storage
and it would dothat
yes
and the rest
would be copied from the host os
all new again when you restart the vm
so
when you boot
it copies the hosts stuff
to the container
then
the container can edit it independently of the host
but when you reboot
it erases that
and copies it from the host again
yeah I guess that works as a valid explanation
so
a docker "container"
can be "shipped"
what does this mean
dunno
i think its like
it can be transported
so i could create one on my pc
then
package it
and ship it
yes
to my server
docker registry is for that
ah a docker "image"
so what does this mean
as an example
it's an image
you can use the image and configure its environment variables and whatnot
and then you run it
would the image
already say what should be kept permanent
what does the image already say
without my help
no you have to say what gets kept permanent
because you have to specify where docker stores those permanent files
i see
hi ramesh
what is kubernetes
just dont venture near kubernetes
unless you want nightmares
why
i want nightmares
it is horrible
so heres my bigger question
how do you do horizontal scaling
kubernetes is a complicated version of docker
that is overly complicated
you mean like load balancing
yea
then I think you need
kubernetes
the worst abomination
alright
so what is kubernetes
it's meant for that
look
I have work to do
google it
I will tell you later
ok
i can also ask my 4h club member
he knows
Visvam
he did kubernetes
see i missed the first minute
cuz i was mystified by his light board
I can't
I just lost it with this one
see what i dont understand is like
if you are netflix
where
is your request going
where are they going
they need to output hundreds of terabits per second
how is that balanced
surely not all connections come through one line
and surely not all of them are managed by one global reverse proxy
Probably the same way with youtube
like i just dont understand
how you scale
like that
meh i dont need to scale
in fact i need to do the opposite of horizontal scaling
i need to do inverse horizontal scaling
running multiple services on one hardware
so imma not worry about this
now i need to know
Isnt Netflix like torrents
what are good specs for a global reverse proxy server
It has like a billion servers and grabs the one nearest to u
Idk
I feel anything would work
no i want a good one
As long as its got a solid internet connection
that doesn't get bottlenecked
they use load balancers probably
also netflix uses freebsd
ramesh
no
what are good specs for a global reverse proxy server
and static web host server
to run nginx
i mean
i could just like
run it all on one server
regardless i need a method of easily dealing with running lots of web servers right now
i could just put them all on the pi
its not dead yet
hmm
hmm
maybe my pi can take a bit more
and now suddenly networking is working
third use of "lol:"
indicate awkwardness
iperf wont work
すみません
when you run iperf
which way does the data do
I hav like 1500 messages
you choose
the server and the client
it goes from the client to the server

I am not happy
I am wearing a mask
And for some reason
I can't breathe comfortably today
Oof
It's like
I've been running
And I'm out of breath
Huh
But I have a mask on
And it stops me from breathing
The big sad
Move ur mask off and see if u can breath better
I can run with a mask on
Idk mask is usually fine
Like it feels like normal
Just today
For some reason
I feel like I'm being deprived of oxygen
I'm going all virtual next week I think
I do not enjoy this
And Michael and akash left me
I am going to class
Good day
I hav to quarantine to see grandma for Christmas
oooo
yea thats goood
cy stay at home
yes
i like strapping stuff to my head
you don't understand
I think
see
i was on zoom during science
for the test
on my phone
and i think zoom
caused my phone to kernel panick
like
?
the phone just stopped
it froze completely
it was stuck on an upside down picture of me taking a test
it was disconnected from my watch
would not turn off
or on
and was mildly  warm
huh
Usually masks are fine
especially in winter
because they heat up my face
Has anyone noticed this as well?
I might just take to wearing a mask during winter
hahaha
to prevent scalpers right
Yes
Yes
During drama club
what if someone made a bot, to complete the captchas
It was not a bad thing
Outside in 4°
To have a mask
I'm in advisory
Bye
why is everyone talking about cyberpunk 2077
cause
it got released today
and its by cd project red
so its gonna be a decent game
mm
it also works on linux apparently
supposedly it has a lot of bugs rn but thats about what i expect
yeah its a big game
i forgot to say Keanu Reeves did mocap and stuff for the game
thats also why it got big
what is mocap
motion capture
where he puts on a suit and special cameras record the suit data to create realitic motion and movement
cause he has a character in the game
Oh I see
im excited
cant play it till christmas, but idrc
why
theres no way your comp will even support it
who says im playing on comp
im not stupid
i have an xbox that im gonna be playing on
how
will your xbox one
support it
r u dumb
its a AAA game
that means Xbox, PS, comp
xb series x and s maybe
no
Xbox one, Series X|S, PS4, PS5
the game started development WAYYYY before the series X|S came out
oh I see
i wont get fancy mirrors
and windows but its still gonna look pretty good
im prob gonna spend like 5 hours on character creation alone
why not get it now
i will
ill have it in like 3-4 hours
im just not gonna play till christmas
otherwise i wont enjoy it
wdym have it in a few hours
Im gonna have the game in a few hours
I mean it's kinda like my getting RoW and starting it 2 weeks later
parents are taking a trip to best buy?
Nope
Amazon
oh fun
Yup
Yea
RoW is a good book btw
did you start WoR
I will tmrw
Yesterday i found out i had an animation project outstanding
Wonderful
today I found out I have an
apush test
tomorrow
quiz
mc
tests next week
hmm, i should study as well
I'm not
I'm ready to read the flashback perspective in RoW
Paweł Czerwiński
I knew it the second I looked at the Unsplash header
are you coming to comp sci
Yes
you(p)
vous
well
no
still that doesn't work
yes
that's you(f) or you(p) right
yes
thou is you(i)
you is you(f)
you is now
but
now
you(i+f)
yes
y'all
is
you(p)
you is also you(i+f+s)
In Korean subject pronouns are silly
as in they don't exist sorta
are you coming to comp sci
He said yes
when
yea i am
k
today
thanks to apple's choice
I will be doing my own thing probably
to use
USB PD
I might get a new phone
accidentally
in macbooks
a universal standard
when my laptop ran out of charge
i used
a makbook charger
to charge it
yea
as;odfjas;lkdj
they aint anything special
BIG CLIMAX
BAD
HELP
thats what makes them special
irony
they just are a white glossy box with the apple stamp
akhil
it is because
they are not special
that they are special
they are like
the one
universal standard
other than like qi
that apple supports
other than in wireless

how do you interpret this

aw
which one
idk

no
no

How dare you take workspace 400
that's leilani and sneha's room even though they don't exist
terminal
multiplexing
and
blur
bwur
Nice
I though u got the mail server working
I got really excited for a moment
well
its like
compiling
but i found a better guide
so imma follow it
Compiling?
yeah for some reason theyre like
dont use precompiled binaries
on rpi
theres this setup script
that like
does everything for you
and automatically deals with compiling
and dependencies
and setup
Huh
so im running it
but its taking a hot minute
but its like
compiling
on a pi
so
im still not using more than 200mb of ram
on the pi
Alacritty: exists
Cy:
what does
"Alacritty"
give me
multiplexing if used with tmux
blur possibly
gpu acceleration
that i dont have
meaning that programs objectively run faster
you would literally notice
the difference
what
uses the gpu
the terminal program
but how does like
how do u just
use the gpu
OpenGL
k but what if what im running doesn't use the gpu
like
if im running
openssh
or ngrok
or the c compiler
like
everything
i run
no like the text display
uses the gpu
the text display
uses the gpu
why
why
it's faster
ramesh
noticeably
you can feel it
sensory feedback
do i look like i need gpu acceleration
yes
on my terminal text
given that you are cy
you are cy
i do not understand
how
why
my terminal
needs gpu acceleration
maybe you linux ppl with unoptimized apps
that run poorly
read the link i sent you
why though
what is a
"terminal benchmark"
this makes
litrally no sense
fine fine ill download it
you will hate it
it doesn't have a gui
you have to configure it with a text file
and it doesn't have tabs natively
you have to use tmux
windows terminal is the same
Tmux is nice
and it has tabs by default
as well as panes
and
it probably also uses this fancy gpu acceleration
and it has blur
and therefore
it is better
i dont wanna install some random thing it wants me to install
idk if blur works
also
what
that might be a linux-only feature
what
the blur?
yes
look
imma use windows terminal
cuz its fast
and fine
yeah ok look i wanna read
i have 30 minutes before I have to start studying for my APUSH quiz
bye
bye
server shutdown. When? now.
but
its not
like
idk i think im close
im getting closer
it exists now
Ach mein Gott!
Oh my God!
why is my mail server not working
Idk
Did i search for this no
Did i watch it yes
Am I satisfied yes
did i watch this like 2 years ago yes
so you see my email server
is not sending or recieving mail
which
as you might imagine
is not ideal
Hmm maybe thats for the best
can you
find me
a tutorial
on citadel
that is not one
i have already seen
Rn no, later/tmrw yes
k
well
i just received a message
from like
5:30
*sigh
k so it is recieving mail
but not sending
and idk why
and i need to stop
but i am now hooked on getting this to work
spam is fun
I saw those, and the Sam time video, the retards will still buy this piece of junk
Ikr
Look at those comments tho
Explains them perfectly
I get reviewers buying em cause thats their job
Anybody else like why
Yuh
Honestly apple stock is looking more favorable
I dont like the company but God there marketing is good
L-1 min
Sry 4 min
Oo
Hell yes
They made that stupid case look half decent
Yea its literally a bra for the headphone
As quoted by samtime
Haha
Idk i think the headphones are utterly ridiculous
like each earcup themselves are worth like 200$
thats the price of qc 35
i can get to qc35 for the price of one airpods pro max
2
idk theyre apple hedfones
they are a part of the brand
the image
the luxury image
the high-tech luxury image
which apple aims to portray
and some people
really like
so
they are right at home
with the wheels
and the stand
and the gold watches
It was true in the days of jobs
They were good
no its still true
its like
a luxury product
But Apple used to b good
with a focus on technology
as well as style
and design
and brand
i only like the cups on those headphones
Yea but today those are irrelevant
they look comfy
i dont like that design
its too
like
not
ok
design sucks
Cook is riding on the wave on f
Jobs
but
yes
the design is quite unique
and
it will be iconic
yes its something “new"
and stand out
so that ppl will notice
as with luxury products
they want to stand out
I'm interested in the hedband part
Head
yea
That might prove rly good
ill wait for mkbhd review on them
or linus tech tips
Def ltt
idk
i want hedphones
cuz you see
right now
on what
oh right
On what
late February
I dont pay attention to this cjst
early march
Chat
when do u think our school will have 100 of these headphones
like 100 kids will have the headphones
After Christmas
Filled
me and cy said late feb
yknow what i bet
alright
I say early January
yknow how like
matt
walked around in the skool
with hedphones
he looked cool with hedphones
right
yea
Yuh
so like
ppl will want to do that
but they only buy apple
is everyone just gonna be walking around with these
so they had airpods
but like
now
they will walk with these
ok airpods i will admit i just wear cause they are convenient and i have them
Its a matter of when not iff
If
but these will look so stupid
they will grow on you
you will see
Walking with headphones is stupid
if u look cool in them go ahead
if ur like the rest of us, dont
Ye
i want over ear headphones
that sound good
those r the only good ones
I have good boes ones
which ones
Idk I hav to look, I barely use them
tell me wich modil
i like my bose headphones
what were u earbuds called again?
the hackja ones
u know the cool ones
and my headphone
?
do you mean the hackja ones
ur NC ones
qc comfort something
i forgot
i have QC 15 at home
galox buds sound good
but like
idk
airpods also sound decent
galox buds are flat
they are not u like most
they are flat
-
cant u change the eq
well yea
but
with no eq
they are flat
and like
the mids
actually sound
present
this would kill me if they were flat
why
even know i have to like eq spotify
i like my bass
they have bass
its just like
not dominant
i need it to be very present
i mean the non wireless galaxy headphones
on those
the bass
dominates all
and its clear
and crisp
that good
but the mids
are not quite
what i want them to be
i wish they allowed u to like full eq it
like get the chart and do fun stuff
wdym
like my jaybirds
u know how i can eq the heck out of it
oh
damn airpods dont do anything fun
no thats just a Samsung feature
wait i can “eq” it
for all hedphones plugged in
or connected
thats still good
in fact
i lost my eq when i unjailbroke
spotify
on android
has no eq feature
it just directs you to that page
huh
i just wish it were easier to get to
or if there was a quick toggle for it
i mean at least u can eq it
for me, i have to trick the health app to think i have a hearing problem
imagine
and itll change my eq however to fit it
but i dont wanna change my health data
galaxy buds are interesting
i wish they had aptx
but they still sound pretty good
ehh idrc
u know what i hate
see idk what apple uses
not aptx
how the audio sounds when u use the microphones
well
thats cuz like
a2dp
its unfun
when doing 2 way
it sounds so bad
LL
what would be interesting
would be to use AptX LL
with a mic
i used them for zoom today, i had to switch the microphones to listenm to music
i used them for zoom today too
they were meh
until they died
then i had to reboot them
mine lasted the entire day
i usually wear mine the entire day
i should not though
see the galaxy buds do weird things
when you take them off
sometimes they just die
sometimes they stop responding
sometimes they stay on
my hearing is getting kinda messed up with transperency mode
?
???
sometimes
when they are in your ear
the touch controls
just
come to an end
this is an issue with the new firmware
imagine having touch controls
it was not a problem before
*cough* *cough*
First time?
wdym
u know how the entire ordeal with airpods pro?
what
how the NC got much softer than when it first was
and messed up EQ
ah that is unfun
Samsungs new firmware was supposed to
and messed up the battery sensors, so it would incorrectly show the wrong charge
improve sound quality
and it kinda did
wait thats a double negative
My bad, show the wrong charge
see im excited for next year
when samsung
is gonna make
prosesirs
processors
wait
wtf
That sent really late
how
what
hold on
What?
i literally
just typed
malay
i thought it was french
im an xpert at this whole languages thing
see
samsung
is signed up
for cortex-x
and you know
what theyre gonna do
they are gonna do
what apple is doing
Making their own chips for everything?
they are gonna make some blazin' fast chips
with like
32 cores
but based on arm reference designs
although
idk if they have the ip yet to do 32 cores
A,M,H,W
?
what
is
that
A chips, M chips, H chips, W chips
M H and W are like
not relevant
Fine A chips
wait
hold on
M is relevant
i forgot
M for Macbook
i was remembering the iPhone 5
with the A5 with M5 motion coprocessor
Ah yes
Haha bad joke im go die now
lays?
the potato chip company?
what
Yes
why
how
is
like
that

Idk
Im kinda dying rn
Ive been studying for like 2 hours now

Ah yea thats usually where the cool indians are
Ooooooo
yes
Thats actually kinda cool
he did the backend
Actually how does Visa work
idk i didn't ask him
Lemme look this up
And then go to bed
i was like
"Hey, Partha uses Samsung Pay"
But not sleep till 10
and he was like
"Yeah, that's because I built it"
........
Thats pretty much just flexing at that point

its just like
hard to use
and it costs money for more than a certain # of requests
just look up

I mean thats understandable cuz they have to use much cloud computing
yes

School internet is down
Only for zoom
Which is wondeful
Yay
I'm
the host of my meeting
The school is fun
Without zoom
Huh
Thats nice
Someone must have hacked fortinet
Wait that means teachers cant zoom
Yes
Unless they use hotspot
Which means classes r not happening
Which they are not allowed to
Or
They can use google meet
Wait damn it my teacher is at home
I hope
Ha
that gym gets cancelled
Idk they are working on this issue
Do my special skill
Frankly
If they just
Every 45 seconds disconnect ur wifi
Killed fortinet
btw
Then wait 30 seconds
i need to send yall a video
Then turn it back on
That would probably fix the issue
Probably
What that
dunno
Whos number is it?
?
🤦‍♂️
how
do you not understand
it's
slitherio
on school wifi
no vpn
Yea ur on a phone
It usually works on mobile devices
Its the school comps it doesnt work on
what about on my laptop
Idk i have not been to school in a whole year
So it might work
xylian
Ramesh
Are you at school
No.
Then
?
Who's video is this
Also
when I went to the SAT
Ah
They unblocked all .ios
YAY
:D
I knew it
I also went to other .ios and it worked fine
why did they  unblock them
But they still block anything that they consider "proxy avoidance"
So essentially
It's a firewall
what about WireGuard
Whose only purpose
is blocking vpns
Is to prevent people
so they can monitor
your traffic
From circumventing it
I haven't tried wireguard
this
there are firewall avoidance vpns
people use it in china
Openvpn works on tcp 443
Only on android
what about
I tested last year
xvideo and other sexually explicit websites
Imma not go to them
Aw
I was gonna ask you to try
Got the new Google assistant
Oooo looks nice
that was... fast
Why does it turn red?
It's cuz google wants to see what's on my screen
But also
The screen recorder wants to see it
So it conflicts
I think
So it doesnt look like that when ur not recording?
Yea
When I'm not recording it's fine
Thats pretty nice
Its quick as well
It used to be faster tho
There's also a new bixby
Bixby is like blazing fast
yeah does Akhil like cuddling girls
But it wouldn't let me record audio
I'm making a bot for samantha
Bots don't need phone verification
Where
Discord?
What is this bot you speak of
Where is it
What is it
What type of question is this
Ramesh-type
Idek anymore
Why?
Yay
^
See pic 1 is default camera app
Pic 2 is telegram built in camera
Its garbage
Yes
Isnt this cause some android thing
Yea
Pretty sure i dont have that much of a difference
What aio should I get
Bruh offload ur images and videos
There is no way u need 40gb if videos
I don't have enough space on my card
Install it on a flash drive
Hold on
U have 70gb of videos
Why
I wike videowez
Clearly
Well at least u still have space
Not for installing apps
I would get those 70gb videos off ur phone and somewhere else
I can move apps to the SD card
No
I want them all
Right here
U cant install onto the SD card?
........
U know what sure
Yes but there's not enough space
I have no use for videos
So I need a bigger card
They are more real
1tb sd card?
Like
When you look back
The moments on video
Ehh i prefer my pictures
Are way more clear
Than those in stills
So I take videos
4k 60?
No 1080p30
Awwww
Most of them
Or maybe 4k30
Idk
I do film quality
The resolution doesn't matter much for most things
I mean yea
I have 21:9 4k 24
In my camera app
Huh
I have 4k 30 but idk the ratio
Fancy
cy
is sending a video
And it does usb or bluetooth mics if you have them
ramesh is currently pirating music

fine
then i dont care
yes

even
are these stickers
our loard
correction
our loard
this will now end
good bye
whylon
Im only at 118 now
see
but my wifi is also bad
for some reason
How far are u from ur router
Cause i am next to it
i have 2 aps
one is 2 floors down directly
And its taking me 16 minutes to install 22 gb
the other is one floor down
I want a new ap
but farther away
I have a range extender but its slow
my 2nd ap is a Fios range extender
but its like
not exactly a range extender
Fios internet is god
cuz its not wireless
its connected to the router over coax
Google fiber would also be cool
I mean thats just an AP then
yea
a coax AP
Those r cool
Whats the point of coax
fios sets up an IP over Coax connection in ur house
cuz like
most houses dont have ethernet
but they have coax
which has fairly high bandwidth
probably about 1gbps max
and then the Fios STBs can access the internet for On Demand Content
Oooo thats good
for all connections total
unlike ethernet which is per connection
since on the coax network
all devices are on the same wire
wire
not cable
Huh
its one wire
+ground
its one shielded wire
Huh
Youtube is great
The algorithm is great
Thats good
SEE!
techaltar agrees
with me
tf is happening there
Probably a soccer match
no like

I watched that
I'm getting closer to a samantha bot

guys my mom bought an m1 mac

but the thing is
she got it with 16gb of ram
just block it
she bought a $1300 piece of junk
I tired
do you have a fireplace
yea
hmm
are you thinking what I'm thinking
yea
but
when i tired to block the purchase
she slapped me
so idk what else i can do
can't do anything with it if it's burnt to a crisp
i mean it will prob do it itself considering it does not have a fan
wait its m1
so its not bad
take it apart
get a razor blade
pry the m1 off the board
and give it to 4h computers so they can eat it
hahahahaha, desoldering an m1
fULL fLavOr
its a munchy chip
it tastes like sand
have you watched this
cuz silicone
yuh
it funee
yes now just replace that with "m1 bread slices"
hahahahahahaha
i would think its like m1 crackers
yeah
"specifically made for 4h computers taste tests"
yes
bruh
"natural lead chunks"
Mmmmmmmm
where is the 4h meme chat
i think in the server

so basically
my brother broke his phone
if you get one oneplus 8t
the other one is 50% off
so it's like really cheap
i see

they will only buy one
then maybe thats not bad
if they buy two
yeah i get it's a good deal
I just like
i don't know
my phone runs very quickly

see i want a new phone
i dont like my galaxy s10e

I'm almost done with RoW, so 2 > 4 > 1 > 3
that's about where I stand with the series
book 4 is very, very good
despite it not being good at the same time
i have managed
to make
the example code
run
Its has
Doesnt look the greatest
what
doesn't
look good
Wait nvm that was just me
The balls looked blurry
yeah
idk why
not for me
anyway
its time
to manipulate things
How do u get 3.js code to run
I also wanna make a 3.js website
you have to have downloaded three.js tho
Hmm okay
I wanna make cool three js website
see the things is
like
you need
assets
Yea
im just gonna start with basic shapes
tho
like
I mean i can try really really hard in blender to make them
surkles
sfears
kyoobs
ray tracing?
?
No
it looks like ray tracing
3.js is like WebGL i think is what its called
yeah
but like
it is 3d
but like
isn't this ray tracing
i mean
i guess it is
Not really
But kinda
Also i found out there is a .cy tld
of course there is
ghana domains
Yea its 218$
oooh
lovely
see
, envMap: scene.background
has now been removed
from the sfears
the thing about three.js tho is you have to do testing on an actual server
cuz it gets mad
huh
looks 10x better
well this is to prove that
that
is what is making it happen
cuz i wanna reflekshins
make them a different color and make a single color background
aww
that's cute
get a seizure
wth is going on
fun things
i just visited it
the balls
are red
they are spheres infused with stormlight
i made the panning more responsive
why did you randomly change your username to Cy for a few days
idk i wanted to try that
and then
it wouldnt let me
change it back
so i had to wait
is a disk
also change the by Pual Debeck to Cy
No I can't yet
and now
ill click on all the stormlight archive posts to see the spoilers
since they won't be those
akhil
wanted this
you may now edit it
as you please
to meet your needs
yup i already got the html
I will have posted spoilers on RoW in a few minutes
Ok
i have
identified
limits
the story of my site
it worked fine
Ok im gonna say this
Ur website broke my browser
mine too
On my phone ofc
But still
It just died
for me
it broke
on my desktop
with gpu
albeit after about 40 seconds of operation
i believe
that was
an example
of actual ray tracing
or "reflection"
not really ray tracing
but getting close
what does this even mean
WELP guess what im reading next
warbreaker
i thought id be done with these books
the sfears arent
like
reflecting tho
they are like
see through
blur
well its distortion
cuz theyre sfears
wait yea thats what it was
i agree
"I unequivocally love the Mac."
im
constructing my story
the image on readybeluga
i just realized
that was the 200kb auto Bluetooth preview version
that got sent to google photos
and so
i went through my sd cards
and found
the original 16MP low compression version
and i will now push that to the site
meh its probably a caching thing
sadly nextcloud will not let me import fonts
so you must have "Circular Std Book" installed on your computer
Ah i should install nextcloud for local use
cy
have you been visiting "adult sites" recently
It's okay
nah
again it's okay
you're a teenager it's only natural to want to explore this
this site used to be fun
now
its adware
ha nvm
thats just
the wrong
url
recent adult sites have given your computer a virus cy
please make this site look nice
please avoid using off-black
please repair your margins and spacing
please do not use a font with rounded ends
unless your ui elements also have the same round
please style your scroll bar
such that it is not a blaring white thing on an otherwise dark surface
in chrome
and fix this
idc
also add a favicon
imma make a thing
that says
"sorry, please use a computer, you uncultured loser"
i see
my phone is not a computer
"use a monitor"
"that is
"larger than
"10 inches"
inchiz
chiz
chizchiz

36p6 is a huge number

My house is M4T1K9
When I go to the website

That's kind of funny in its own immature way
it is
its back up
we can go to skool
that was underwhelming

calculus teacher didn't start the meeting yet
sadge
See I want to have an impact
I want to make something that is relevant
to people
there was this thing
my mom showed me
saying that
the only real way to find what matters to ppl
is to ask them
many of them
I want to survey a large group of ppl
and find out
what they want
hello
hi
I want to survey a large group of ppl
who
should i survey
idk
depends on what u wanna do
wdym
u want something relevant right
i want an idea that doesn't come from my head
it comes
from the heads
of ppl
well there are two types of seeable relevances imo
who are actually wanting
the solution
Xplane
the older generation, and the younger one
so like
teachers
the older generation will want something vastly different then the younger generatuion
and students
well yes, but lets expand and say people in the workforce and dependents
ok...
so u have dependents which are the elderly and the young, and people who are in the workforce
yes
but that's a little more broad than i was thinking
by a large group of ppl
i meant like 100-1000
depends on what u wanna do
web stuff prob
then u can prob just take any 1000 people off the street/in the town and ask them
but with 100-1000 people its gonna be something local
see i wanted you to say like
teachers
that way
like
cuz
and even within that 1000 people there will be vast differences
that's what i was thinking
teachers
the thing with teachers is
well you see i wanted you to say that
without me prompting you
they can get anything they want
that way
like
wdym
the “market” is big
there are a lot of teachers
no at ridge
and teachers support the younger generation
not all the teachers in əmərəcə
what would teachers at ridge need specifically
if u could name a few things then yes survey teachers
that's exactly the question
i do not know
that's why
i want to survey them
then go ahead, there are like 200 teachers in the school right?
but the reason i wanted you to say teachers
is that
i wasnt sure if this was like
some weird idea
that's just weird
its not
it may be a cliched group of people
but its not weird
no but that's kinda the point
you dont make something for everyone
thats what google and amazon are doing
you make something
for the ppl who have been excluded
from google and amazon
ppl for whom the general system does not work fully
are teachers really excluded though
they do not have to be "excluded"
but like
im sure
theres something
they want
that google isnt giving them
but that can be done
like
something thats not profitable large-scale
but very useful
at the level of ridge teachers
then yea u can find a method of surveying them
i personally feel that the teachers at ridge have everything they need
but ur not one of them
so you dont know
yea thats my point as a student
see the thing my mom showed me is like
pretty sure u cant mail all the teachers
this person
was like
so
they are the head of a company
that starts companies
so they created like
several
such as this marriage service for homosexuals
and
MongoDB
and they created these by asking ppl about their problems
they thought everything was fine
but then they asked 300 ppl
if they were having problems
and several of these ppl
brought up their issues
and they were able to start successful companies out of these ideas
so the idea is like
you ask all the teachers
what could be better
and they tell you
well, i want a better form of webassign.
i want an easier attendance system.
i want ________
and you find the things
that they say in common
you see patterns
and then you create something
that solves their problem
and present it to them
you provide outreach and produce impact
its not like some random thing thats kinda funny not really very useful that no one cares about
like most of my projects
i wanna try something
or anyone really
uh sure
join "space"
with link
sent
uh sure
go to wink
i am waiting in the lobby
rewoad
i mean yea u could do this, but ill play devils advocate for some of the examples that u give
k...
webassign is by cengage, an actual company which aslo ties into the textbook
yes
but
lemme tell u something
so teachers are not just gonna switch, also from my teachers experience he doesnt mind webassign
lemme tell u somehting
wut
i talked to dr pernia
and he said
that is really very difficult to make questions
he would make them himself
今日はまるで昨日みたいだ
Today is like yesterday
but its too hard
hmm
interesting
so he uses the textbook
song lyric ofc
the built in ones
and so you see
if it were easier to make questions
then maybe it would not need ties to the textbook
though teachers are fine with webassign
hmm mabye
i dont think theres a need to reinvent the wheel there
i mean this.....
its kinda tied in with genesis so
well but
my health teacher
always has trouble with figuring out whos absent
quickly
and easily
she rn
is using a google classroom assignment
and everyone has to submit it before 5 mins into class
uh wut?
wa katteiru wa katteiru kerero
our teacher just either looks at the participants tab or just calls out names out
wa katteiru wa katteiru kerero
ha.
use transliterations
participants is first name ordered
and it tells you who's there
not whos not
genesis
wants whos not there
and in last name order
idk our teacher does quick attendance
so for smaller classes
its ok
also especially if all the students are there
well that too
ur health teacher has a clase of 30+
but anyway
idk if these are real issues
far greater than most of the teachers outside the subject field
i would have to survey to find out
u should ask teachers
naneun akil igo neteufeurikeuseuleul saranghae
see - survey
neoneun akil igo neteufeurikeuseuleul saranghae
use a google form, and then ask ur ap seminar as research
?
나는 아킬 이고 네트프리크스를 사랑해
I'm Achill and I love Netfrikes

hmm

interesting
i will contact mr y then
if hes responsible for that
except instead of kids u can ask teachers
안녕하세요 저는 아킬 이고 넷플릭스를 사랑해요
see i dont wanna ask students
Hi, I'm Achill and I love Netflix

I saw a random book series called "Malazan"
on reddit
let me look into whether I should read it
tf is this
k i think im done
with youtube
for today
now be a good student and actually understand the answer
do not copy
copy=not know
not know=bad
for reference
what is RoW
Rhythm of War
a book
a good book
i see
should i read it
cy should read
the way of kings
so he can get to rhythm of war which is the fourth book in the series
it is good
this post
says
unlike ramesh
cy
does not
"I hate fantasy books"
but then the person was like
read in his free time
"nvm"
he should
but he doesnt
try it
please
i just dont like
kings
and war
and stuff
idk
sigh
have you
read
the stormlight archive
it is
different and better than typical
fantasy books
its still a fantasy book
you are too biased
you have to read it
before you say
"it's JUST a fantasy book"
what is it about
you can't just put a blanket statement on a brandon sanderson book
that doesn't work
yeah uh the plot is really complex so it has a bunch of plots
so I can't tell you exactly what it's about without literally spoiling it
who are the main characters
Kaladin
Shallan
Dalinar
Jasnah
idc their names
hahahaaha
who are they
like
what are they
Kaladin is a slave
who has to run bridges
meaning
they place bridges on like
sigh how do I explain this
like small island-cliffs for the army to get to the other side
k hes a slave
next
yeah
uh
sigh
uh
Dalinar is a highlord 
Adolin is a highprince
Jasnah is the king's sister
good luck
understanding the terms
*yawn
that is
because you haven't read it
you have to be
as akhil says
open-minded
i see
what is this book called again
the way of kings
and where is the ebook
just like read the prologue
you dont understand
i thought my nook was dead
after like 3 months
just on
charge your h*cking kindle
in a corner
yes
it was at 16%
but ereaders have good battery life
hell yes
in a way
brandon sanderson is h*king intelligent
since
my kindle lasts like a week
my nook
lasts
like
forever
to underestand oathbringer's references FULLY you need to have read Mistborn, Elantris, and Warbreaker
but guess what you gotta pay him some money to do that
so hes a genius
bezos
yknow what i dont get
literally numworks
porque
k so you know how they added RTC
gimme one moment
Omega did, its also in beta
not numworks
continue
so how come
this numworks
only lasts 3 days with an rtc
whereas
my nook
with an RTC and literally WiFi
lasts 3 months
the screen
and the numworks
is doing
nothing
nothing
^
off
^
it only lasted 3 days
this has got to be
the most CPU intensive
RTC
ever on earth
i mean one way i can think is that its not doing rtc correctly
these chips are designed to be able to run an rtc for 40 years off a button cell battery
but ur nook can also just fetch the time whenever it wakes up
the button cell battery is supposed to kill the human
from chemicals
before they can find
that the rtc has died
and omega
cant make it last more than 3 days
something is amiss
well try fixing it?
yes but no
it has an offline mode
in which it still keeps the time
anyway
^
i should read the "prologue"
idk how to use their code
oooo is good
my favorite
of the ebook Ramesh sent me
yes
szeth-son-son-vallano
i want to read it on my pc
meh
imma just use my nook
if we can get cy far enough
i get to change the gc name to stormlight trio
i read the "prologue to the stormlight archive"
4 pages
do you understand how long it takes me to read things
wait it was 4 pages?
who was the mc
Kalak and Jerizen
read the next chapter
*sigh
i like realistic fiction
i do not like Capitalizedthings
that are made from Twowords
that do not Makesense
ill at least read the first chapter
read
the next chapter
this is the wrong chapter
hes reading the right one
that's like
he is now?
yea i think so
szeth
okay hopefully that hooks him
Szeth son son vallano
szeth is insane
ly good
Lashings
are cool
i must also read scott fitzgerald for an hour
no
this wont take an hour
yes
regarless of what this takes
its like 20 min
i still need to read scott fitzgerald
for an hour
yes but this ownt take an hour
do it
for school
it's a good prologue
k
why for an hour?
cuz im a slow reader
cuz i have issues
the great gatsby takes like 20 minutes per chapter
also i need to read more than one chapter
Szeth-son-son-Vallano
*yawn
no i still dont like fantasy
and why not
also the magic of the story only happens later
no i still dont like fantasy
it gives me a headache
Fantasy, Magic, Gods, Religion
Swords
imma find a different book to read
i like books that delve into the fundamental psychology of humanity
ones that produce nontrivially generalized concepts
from otherwise innate events
im sure this book does that to a certain extent
but i do not wish to have to climb over all of this legend, magic, religion, supernatural, and swords
in order to get to it
therefore
you must like this book for a different reason
you must be searching for this impossible theoretical world
*sigh
what is it with me and culture
movies books and games
i never like what most ppl do
ima eat pita chips
you don't
need to understand the swords and stuff
there is a STORY to it as well cy
it's not just the worldbuilding
although I really like worldbuilding
how you know samantha bot is working
indeed
the Samantha bot
do you like to lick socks when socks are in people's feet
this needs
to end
or just do you like to lick feet without socks
k
so i have brought that to an end
at least for now
as no more such comments
will be permitted
as long as my bot isnt dead again
bonjour
Hello
k
It is definitely Cy
I am Cy
Someone, likely Ramesh, has said something that will not be translated.
I'm definitely Cy and I love to see really cute girls
And I just absolutely positive love stroking them too.
Mind that my English is bad, that doesn't matter! Cute girls are my favourite.
look
as long
as we are not licking ppl
im good
i wrote a short story
but i will not share it now
I did too
how short
mine is 350 words
oh
right
wait
mine are much longer than that
twice that
or thrice that
my story is concise
almost poetic
i will now do an hour of notes for history
good bye
Yes, I have seen this before
so now
they are
bouncy
its subtle
but it is there
read
read
it's bad
but like
this is my short story
what do you think of my short story
i like the imagery in yours
but i dont like fantasy
so i am biased in my overall opinion
it's literally NOT fantasy
please burn your font
change it to times or I'm not reading it
books are written in Georgia
not times
Doesn't matter
some
serif font
please
fine
I hate reading sans-serif
there
does this make you happy
or does it make you sad
because my story
is sad
sad
although it is slightly confusing
yeah its a little
confusing
its all like
inferences
also my story is fantasy
but
there will be no magic until the second book
no hes in class
No i here
no read
mine
also cy were you confused by mine
somewhat
what were you confused about
lemme read more of it
um
is good
the other parts are not in order
considering that u said that it was suppose to be sad
its sad tho
while reading it i dont feel “impact” like i can tell its kinda sad
but its not really sad
if u get my drift
sorta
what do you think of mine
its about
this person
wait did akhil read
who dies
mine
yes
no
ill read urs next
no this is mine
i suppose someone dies in urs as well
so tell me what you were confused about
i want to make sure you're confused about the right things
and that I wasn't too vague
im getting harcore SA vibes from urs
yeah it literally
felt
like
the one chapter
that i read
from SA
lol
i agree
it's more the writing style
than the plot
yeah
its not a bad thing
I will see about that
did
you see
just so you know
the new animations
like
i will
but like I read other books too
remember that book i gave akhil
three dark crowns
i think they do similar things
Courting Darkness?
i wanna read a book that is not fantasy
Ah yes
wait did I give you that
so i will find one
i did
uh yeah u did
read
the fault in our stars
by john green
i heard about that
read it it's good
also akhil tell me when you're done reading mine
ill read urs later
Mattheiu est en ligne
mais il ne parle pas
personne ne parle
tout le monde est silencieux
but cy
what are you confused about in my story
please
je ne l'est pas encore lit
entierement
d'accord
est-ce tu veux que je le lis maintenant?
non, c'est bien
tu peux le lire quand tu veux
meh je ne veux pas faire mes devoirs pour l'histoire maintenant
je vais lire ton histoire
...
d'accord
me dis quand tu as terminé
i read it
so theres this guy
who doesn't like this other guy
so he goes
to the guy's grain house
and burns it
then
he goes to the guy's house house
and burns it
but
actually
not
because
he forgot his tools in the grain house
and then ppl find him
and kill him
what did you derive from my story
i don't know
honestly
does it make sense
my story
or yours
mine
yes more or less
how about mine
no
but I like that
its not supposed to
it's a good thing
what did you derive from mine
what did you understand
some guy is dying and depressed
and something weird keeps happening to the soap
he hides
he spends each night
for an extended period of time
crying
in the shower
without washing
and the soap
symbolizes him
the foam though
the creamy thing
that is what happens if you leave soap in steam
for long periods of time
and its fragile
so if you touch it
it will go away
???
but its still there
so he hasn't touched it
that's confusing
interesting though
ok but in the last paragraph i explain it for you
I will
wait
I made a mistake that contradicts the story's events in T9
since I had not like
planned T9
i must go
I wrote it for something else
to English class
sigh
bye
bye
i wanna learn xcode/flutter/android
but i need an idea
you should get on board with me
to survey a buncha ppl
so we can get ideas
cuz like
i wanna learn web design
but i need an idea
although if i were you
i would look into bluetooth
cuz its speshul
only mobile apps have axess to this teknoligy
its what makes them Unique
hardware access
like sensors, cameras, BT/BTLE, NFC, and such
I wanna make an ESP button
its just a button that runs on an esp01 module
so you plug it in
and press the button
and it sends an http request or mqtt publish
Hmmm
Yea i might do something like those
i might I
?
i see
you mean an ESP buton
or hardware access in apps
Yea i might
imma make a pcb for mine
so essentially
Do u mean plug in the esp to the phone?
no
these are different ideas
the esp button
is 3 parts
an esp01
holdon
a carrier board for it
which supplies power and gives it a tactile button
and a nice enclosure
for them
Oo
hardware access is different
Hmm yea
its like
bluetooth
esp01 doens have bluetooth
it has wi-fi
Yea
so its a wifi button
Thats kinda cool
Use a wifi button
its like an exercise in PCB design
like a very simple
first step
Yea i might try designing a pcb
I see
Im trying to see how those nfc hotel cards work
oh thats simple
they just have an nfc chip in them
u do not make those
So its a chip
those are commoditized
what do you want to know about them
i know all about them
Idk I thought it would be cool to design a pcb that has nfc on it
well you would not be making one of those cards
you would be making a reader
or a transmitter
but not a "tag"
as they are called
Hmm i should look up on this
see
tags are interesting
bc they do not require external power
they are powered wirelessly by the reader
but you just buy tags
and program them
cuz they are really hard to make
yourself
Huh
they are really easy to make in a factory
with equipment
to embed coils and chips in plastic
is there different things beside tags?
well like i said there are tags
readers
and transmitters
the phone has a tranciever
it can read and transmit
i want lora
but alas
ah lora
no not alas
this is not the end
of my fight to reach lora
je vais manger
a tout a l'heure
yes
Wanna build one
I do
But 144 segments
That alot
Idk I'ma do a possibility analysis after I drink a coffee
Alrighty
Coffee break time ig
Pita chips
Ah the best chips
Yes
Stacy's
I ran out of cream
Black coffee it is
oof
imma make hot chocolate
Cy is sending a video
I'm going to write a story
Is that sugar at the bottom?
Another one
Yes
alright
just try too not make it to SA like
Thats a lot of sugar
Too
No
It's like 1.5 cubes
is it?
Its really spread out
It looks like more
i do like half a spoon
yea
I do 2 tiny spoons
Bruh I put ice cream in sometimes and that rocks
But also this has no cream
Cuz I ran out
yes
Rip
u mean milk?
Coffee makers are like printers
Cream
or actual cream
Also I don't do milk
I do plant based
tsk tsk tsk
How much do you think that coffee maker cost
coffee things are like 150$
I do love eating toner
ofc
its just the best
which one is ur favorite
Idk
Cyan
I actually forgot
But I was looking earlier
They don't charge much for the machines
Yes
Have u started cyberpunk
i mean the good ones are like upper 100$
But since they use proprietary capsules
nope
have u seen the CDPR notice thing
I can't do this whole phone texting thing
Yup
I'm leaving the chat and drinking my coffee
they allowing refunds for console users
Do u have the original Xbox
yea
idrc
seems hit or miss
If it’s one x or s it’s fine if it’s orig it’s like 720 p 20 FPS
It’s not good
if i have ever noticed anything playing on a day one xbox, its that visuals are gonna be bad no matter what
so these kinda bugs are things im used to
RDR2 looked garbage on my xbox and bugged out a ton
Next gen consoles actually look rly good
yea
i wanna get an s
Series S looks good, and is cheaper than the X
What made you decide console over pc
ive had a console longer
i mean pc may be better
But you can’t find any parts lmao
but i like just sitting at the couch, picking up the controller, turning on surrond sound and playing
yea
True
Ngl i think the xbox one resolution and stuff is like normal/im used to it
i have a garbage tv regardless
It’s playable at the very least
^
oh hell yea
Which is honestly insane
besides Jan patch and Feb patch
those should fix everything it seems
PS4 was supposed to give refunds but they aren’t
this is
the source code
FOSS
actually?
is
communism
FOSS?
Yup they are making people wait until the feb or Jan patch to be allowed to refund them or something
Free Open Source Software
*Cough, never buy digital*
*cough, never preorder*
ehh im fine with preordering stuff
i usually get it cheaper
i paid 40$ for cyberpunk
I but dig so i might well just wait
yea its what a 90+ hour game
i mean yea u might as well
if its a game im intrested in ill usually just preorder
oo new GTA dlc came out today
I’m just about done at 37.5 with a lot of side quests
Nice
Not nearly as long as Witcher but still pretty long
How longs the witcher?
It took me over 130 hours
Dang
Have u read reviews?
Or been on the r/
for cyberpunk or witcher?
ive seen some
Cyberpunk
i dont wanna go there
It’s a mess
Day before people were so hyped now they are saying it can’t be fixed
all the people i usually watch for gameplays and stuff find the game pretty fun
It’s pretty good I think but it could never live up to the hype
yea hype got way to big
If it was not hyped so much there would not be this much backlash
They announced it like 8 years ago but only started working like 3-4 ago prob believed they were working the whole time
yea, but game development is tough i will say that
True
yea its also not as big of a company i would say
compared to like sony
or Bungie
That’s true
honestly for what it is its fine
they could never appeal to the market
cause when they delayed it the devs got death threats
so when they released it *slightly* buggy, still people got pissed
Oh it’s rly buggy
huh it seems really hit or miss
I’ve had many bugs with quests not updating and having to load and reload
some of the gameplay/reviews people have had no bugs at all
Then randomly getting 3 FPS
oh yeah thats a huge problen
If they were doing mainly early game or just mainline stuff then it’s fine
hopefully, HOPEFULLY, this gets all fixed and good in the january patch
It happened mostly in unskippable cutscenes so it took like 30 mins to get through
Much hope
unskippable cutscenes?
uh
apparently using cyberpunk on linux brings out some bugs and gets rid of other windows cyberpunk bugs
linix
linix
gets rid of bugs?
thats not to bad actually
brings out bugs
as well
i mean it would probably make it run better and stuff
intel
why am i responding
that was a Matthew question
cause if its AMD u need some binaries/fun stuff to make it better
hes using intel tho
oh then that wont fix the frame drops
man game design is really tough
learn three.js
its ez
Yeah I use intel
i have math class in 10 minutes
?
she was out
so she said
come to me
at 1:45
oh tutorial pd
like
no
its like
the audio broakes
a class
in lunix
ramesh
cannot talk
about
lecher les personnes
Someone, likely Ramesh, has said something that will not be translated.
lick the people
is what it says akhil
ah okay
licking ppl
-ing
are you planning on learning three.js
I will
Cy likes to stroke female legs
Not Cy, how could u say that
Ramesh aime se carreser
Ramesh likes to square
Ramesh likes to square
wtf
Ha
no i do not like stroking myself cy
and caressing myself
........
My game is crashing at the worst possible part again and again
Ramesh aime se caresser
there
i spelled it
correctly
oh that suxs
you said they have been working on this for 10 years?
started 8, but it includes funding, mocap and development
so probably actually for like 3 years
i see
maybe its good to wait
and not
play
until
everything is fixed
regardless i will not be playing
i mean yea
why not?
cy does not like this kind of video game
he dont play videogames
or fantasy books
fantasy books are ok
akhil
It rated M, so its not for Cy
where are you in words of raidance
yeah that's why I wouldn't play it either
idk
and I'm not allowed to play video games anyway
yalb
its literally a punch shoot game
you like
punch
and shoot
and walk around
yulch nobody wants a stylus
yalb
*Cough Cough* Violence, Gore, Alcoholism/Drug Use
does akhil know about yalb
*cough* *cough* tylko jedńo w głowie mam

oh finally it sends
Did u figure out the raito of helium one

so yes
What is it
for 81 seconds its 230
g/mol
Oh I meant the raito one that was helium
send a picture
is it the one with helium and neon?
2.25
How
Velocity He/Velocity Ne = sqrt(molar mass Ne/molar mass of He)
if u plug it all in on the right side of the equation u get the ratio
Oh I forgot square root
scalp
Yuck
uh wut
guys
That’s disgusting

It’s perfect
You did a cite for Charles?
no but its my domain
it is perfect
i would have liked it in the middle
but this shall do
The wiki for computers is down :(
yes
the reason is that
nginx
is being a bad
doesnt ur website kinda load slow
there its back up
ah nvm ur webpage is just down
no its not slow
it has cloudflare
is now up
a three.js live experiment
his 3.js stuff
What’s 3.js
its 3d
for your browser
and
its fckin awsome
send him the holy grail website
the corn revolution
that is 3.js
this is life
matthew died in amazement
at the quality
at least
ikr
he died
knowing
why
i want to learn three.js
yes
r u gonna make assets and stuff?
probably not many
i wanna
frankly its a time vs outcome thing
whatever i can do in the least time
with the most wow
is what i will do
i mean yea, but blender is hella fun
its fun to mess around in it
i should learn blender
if u wanna “Learn” it then go ahead
y know what else i should do
Hw?
literally my homework
yes do it
i have been conversing with ppl
for 11.5 hours today
that a long time
started with zoom
then telegram
then a long discussion with Alankar
about everything
hes on it now
to give perspective
for the amount of time
i spent with him
and then
i came here
my mind is stimulated
from all this soshil interactchin
i will not be asleep early today
i have done science on my mind
i have done a to do list as well
and it is telling me
to do my hw
and to do it now
so i will obey
bye
E
i sat up for a minute
and i came back for 35 edge tabs
to*
yes he demonst8ed it to me
it works
it just like
opens tabs
yeah
at a rapid rate
i made it open edge tabs
so i would see it
edge is good browser
on my taskbar
use edge
yeah but ppl bully me for it :(
dont let ppl
get in ur way
i tell them to jump off a cliff and then i feel better :)
good boy
yknow what i should do
my hw
bye
Bing yuck
bing yuck
edge good
literally switch it to google
^
Then why use edge
bc its better
cause its chrome
the scrolling is nicer
but not google
and it works better on windows
and like
its actively getting new features
and it can read social sciences papers aloud to you
really?
yes
it reads everything aloud
pdfs
websites
oo that nice
it is
u know why u use edge
and the voice isn't half bad
edge://surf
thats it
yes
the only reason
also
even Ramesh uses edge
over chrome
but not over firefox
its like
why do ppl use pop os over stock ubuntu
they are the same thing
but one is better
idk, i really like ubuntu server
no like for a desktop env
oh yea
pop
even tho its literally ubuntu
and u can do like apt install pop-skin
on ubuntu
Just use arch
pop is still better
i would use arch
if i had a reason to
i should set up an arch vm
i use windows
windows
ill do it over winter break, cause i wanna rice it
is good
i like
it good
regularly use windows features
controversial topic
mac os is also not bad
that are windows exclusive
like
OneNote with a pen
autohotkey
Wireless Display mode
yea those r nice
but i dont use them
or have any need of them
i use OneNote exclusively for notes
i do not use a notebook
i just use .md
i use auto hotkey for lights
and for ə
and wireless display
just like
always comes in handy
it was truly something at drama club
to be able to cast from the light control pc
to my laptop
and then
just
carry my laptop
to the stage
Cy is Charles a senior?
yes
we have one more show with him
before he is gone
So you are going to be doing booth alone
Booth haha
and no prob not alone
prob with like u
or someone else
¡™£¢§§¶•ª–≠«‘“πøˆ¨¥†®´∑œåß∂ƒ©˙∆˚¬…÷≥≤µ˜∫√ç≈Ω
Pardon me the card table
is schwa in there?
?
no
huh
but fun stuff is there
Since it was a folding table
what
about
the folding table
is this a joke
cuz if it is
The booth for the winter one
i dont get it
you do not want to have to take out the table in the winter
i am lost srry
Nvm
regardless
i heard we will be having a musical
from this person
…
and there were emails about musical auditions
so that means
……………………………………………………………………………………
it is a thing
……………………………………………………………………………………
….?
idk
the musical will be fun
they always are
being in the pit must be cool
this time maybe i can get mr Harvey to use WS2812s
but hella hard
see
our standards are not high
one of
our
lighted signs
last year
started burning
after mr Harvey touched it
and not me
was it the one u made
no
awww
it was the one Harvey wired
mine were all perfect
*cough
Hmmm
instead
i caused
an explosion
in the booth
after opening house doors
uh wut
on the Saturday night show
with the most ppl
due to
a
um
miscalculation
with regards to
the
um
dial
miscalculation?
on the multimeter
it was set to
um
current
and not
um
voltage
so
oh no
when i shoved it in a plug
it went big kaboom
oh no no jno no non o no no no no non no no no no no no non no
and smoke arose
dont be stupid kids
mr Harvey asked me what i learned
i told him
"always check to make sure ur multimeter is not on current"
he told me
"dont shove random crap in plugs"
"after house doors have opened
"on the Saturday night show"
oh wait
thats like
when they open the doors
to let the audience in
yea ik that
im not completely stupid
dont worry akhil
i will not take his advice
i will continue
ok good
to shove random crap in plugs
i thought u were gonna take the advice for a moment
imagine
yknow what was also fun
with that show
2 days before the show
lights?
mr Harvey updated the firmware
on the sound board
that never goes well
and
it
erased
everything
all the cues
his comment was
"Cy, take a lap or two..."
aka
"I might have a mental breakdown and im not interested in sharing it with you"
haha
and then Charles
had to come over
and spend like
6 hours
redoing everything
u should join tech
especially since ur not in all honors
so u have some time
im in AP's
k but like
but yea i might
so am i
and matt
U ded should
Def
dead
I’m def
are you on desktop
if you are
No
up arrow is edit last message
Ah
how does one print their own pcb
now im on desktop so much easier
the sponsor of this video
i have watched enough GreatScott to know
they cost like 20$ for shipping alone
more like $6
they are not too terrible
the boards are like 5$
but its not like having a mill in ur house
$2
for a four layer board
what a deal
yeah what do you want
like
a 10 layer board?
30
no
15
you only need like
2 layers
One for every site you have
yes
with pcbs
because
yes ik
yknow what i need
i am looking it up on google
and its just like
make it say yes
a static site
not a dynamic one
a static one
I will NOT
i repeat NOT
make that right now
make it dynamic
no
why
tmrw
no
because
it would never need to change
I love these stickers
it would just be like
yes
all the time
but what about summer
no i would change it then
but thats not worth making a dynamic site
and guess what
summer assignments are a thing
and guess when i finish them
midnight on the last day
i shit you
its tetris
on one of those displays
an ssd1306 display
yes
or this
e ink display
yes
that too
but
that is not as fun
as a simple OLED display
yes
although maybe it is
idk
yknow what i must do
idk imma make one of them, or both
HW
do it
stop talking to me
go offline
make me see
that you are not there
to listen
Me when taco bell
was space just FOMO?
between the Russians and the americans?
Yup
I can make u one
I'm getting mill
I can also design it for you based on what its purpose is
But I can only mill a 1 side pcb
I think u can do a 2 on a mill
But idk how
ill prob get jlcpcb just to do it
cause they can also do the fancy soldering
jlc has kwality
i have used them
i hate that u cant do the fancy soldering with any other mask
it has to be green mask
we discuss l8r
i have comments
to make
I will probably submit this
oops I have an extra word
um
i mean
sure
if
like
even zoom thinks i should delete stuff
rip
i will not delete
i will ask for ram
and ssd
for Christmas
what if i used 3 channel memory
does that like
is that bad
or is it good
cuz i dont wanna get 2 new sticks
i also dont wanna replace my current 2
3 channel isnt great
no
i wanna just like
it's like
just
bad
buy
8gb
stick
computer might not even boot
with 3
and insert
i don't think that's a thing you can do
I tried it once
I got some free ram from some random dude in a garage sale
and the ram worked
but I tried putting 3 gb of ram
in my computer
3 sticks
and it no work
1 work
2 work
3 no works
4 works
I think
Just go for another pair
^
but thats Xpensive
it's like
not
like 70
50 dollars
no not 70
i dont need 32gb
it's gotten cheaper
for 16
i bought 32 gigs
for 105
here
how about this
ill buy one stick
and see if it works
you should
if it doesnt
buy in pairs
ill buy
another one
it's just like better that way
much cheaper to buy in pairs
asdn;flkajsd;flkasdjf
+1
and in higher quanties
I have 32 gigs rn
ill probably update to 64 later
i mean
if i can convince my parents to pay for it
then im good on the 2 sticks
its just that like
i dont like losing money
on unneccesary things
read it cy
also what storage r u gonna get
i have a 1tb nvme ssd
idk some cheap thing
like
pcie 3
cheap nvme
and a 6tb hdd
and a 1tb hdd
idk or maybe a sabrent
I have a sabrent
i could get a samsung
overpriced
but i dont need that kwality
not necessary
red is blue more like I fucking cried
you didn't
i did
he did
what is this
i hum to skepticism that you cried
but if you did that was the goal
me
bruh
troll
i should read Ramesh's story
yes do
you shouldnt unless u ready to cry
cy
this is
500 words
fine ill read it now
and then the great gatsby
I shed 500 tears
matt
whaddidya think of mine
Yes
dude, u can even just look up summaries and stuff
of what
my story
repost it
I love seeing cream in the shower
lol
i wonder what cy will think of my story
idk i read it
and
im a little lost
about this glass cage
its probably a me thing
good
im generally lost
idk who the narrator is
that was what I expected
is this a person
a child
yes
it like
says
that
what happens tho
like
IPE
he sings a song
just to see if it makes sense
what is ipe
in plain english
He literally sings a song
and cries about it after
about what tho
like
pretend i didn't read this
the song is a bit tricky
what does it mean
oh he sings a song about his life
I don't know
myself
hmm
that's up to your interpretation
you have to see how it fits into your life I guess
see cuz what im trying to understand
see
i saw this child
right
in a glass cage
being carried away
yes
from his family and friends
yes
but
where
is
like
who cares
oh
the meaning and the symbolism
what is the theme
the message
the message is literally
one of the sentences
at the end
"And I’d tell everyone to make the front pane can see the back, but I can’t"
i do not understand
that sentence
do you
not read the first four paragraphs
everyone to make the front pane
is a noun
you can see what the front pane symbolizes
in the first two
the back pane symbolizes in the second two
im getting lost
about the first two
the second two
the people
who are to make the front pane
you are asking the wrong questions
i am lost, ramesh
as to what it means
hmm
i wonder what akhil will say
also I think I made a mistake
it has lost me with beautiful tone
I am going to splice a line
wdym
it is beautiful writing
that has lost me
in a corn maze
with no end
"He feeds her with pride
His friends ridicule his life
His deeds are alive
Burning with the last light of night"
but then
ok but like ik hes being taken away
i go over the stupid word limit
ok
but
it can be
reasonably inferred
he is being taken away
because
he tried to commit suicide
because he's depressed
the baby?
the child comes from the baby
what
this is puberty
he wonders where he came from
and the implications of this
the child
cannot
what
is
the child has a baby
i do not get it
no
the child was once a baby right
yes
so now he wonders
"the baby is alive"
"the child wonders why"
so why was the baby alive
why was he given life
so
hes thinking back
the child wonders
how to make babies
but
who tries to commit suicide
and how old is the child
the child
and what is happening to them
tries committing suicide
and the child is probably an adolescent
since adolescents undergo puberty
2 things
the child
1. does this involve worldbuilding - like i have to understand this glass container
tries to commit suicide
no
and 2.
at first
technically the glass container is metaphorical
but it comes from a movie scene
i didn't even know whether this narrator is person or fish
at the end of some mission impossible movie
it is a person
he has a family
and friends
you are thinking about it too much
i will read it again
cy
i do not make my narrators
pieces of soap
my narrator was not a piece of soap
also i read it again
i kinda catch where this is coming from
i see the glass cage as this separator between the adolescent and the real world
and he looks down on the real world
reminiscing about his life
prior to entering it
but
the "zoo"
loses me
and some of the poem
and you have some grammatical issues
I look behind me again, and rem
i look behind myself again
the zoo
is what
uh
like a caged animal
but
like they observe it with interesting and disinterest
the caged animals
are not commiting suicide
he already
and they did not decide
to be caged
tried committing suicide
did he succeed?
the end result is he is being wheeled to an insane asylum
ah
no otherwise he wouldn't be in the cage
well idk
like i said
i thought he was a fish
grammar
you think in weird ways
literally how
does a fish have school
yes
as a matter of fact
asl;dfsal;f
pun
i hate this
see
its just
too hard
to infer
occam's razor
that he is going to an insane asylum
see that's my intention
but idrc where you think he's going
that's like just not the point
i think hes dead
or not present
in the real world
uh
the last line shows he's dying
so he's still alive
wait
i see
why
this could make not sense
idk i think theres too much going on
look i had to get it in 500 words
you must write a story
with an intention
of being concise
excluding
anything
unneccesary
like the zoo
shrug
idk
it's description
how many ppl have read this
well I doubt anyone is going to read this other than you
no one
have someone else read it
i have
no friends
see if they are also just as lost
were you lost
yes
when you read mine
slightly confused
but not lost
i see
but like
if you keep reading mine
and try to understand it
it makes sense
look
i can derive meaning from things
but
you need
to guide me
like
i just like
your story
the fish thing
must not
doesn't make sense
simply
present itself
it must
guide
my derivations
of meaning
and generalization
so essentially
be more specific
I agree
but i mean idk if ur not going to send ur story to anyone else
then I go over the word limit
ur not gonna get good feedback
i do
they dont read
get rid of unneccesary
them
there is plenty necessary
you can cut things out
you can be more concise
how many times have you rewritten this story
the poem is hard
to be concise on
i think i can do some things though
ramesh
the word limit
should not be an issue
for short stories
i write
long stories
you should be easily below the word limit
well then write a short one
my
short stories
are two pages
did you read "The Landlady" by roald dahl
and like 1000 words
no
its not particularly short
its like 3 pages
but its like mine
it never mentions death once
but it is a story of killing
murder
Yes
This is a good story
it is right?
Its one of my favorites
Yup its all implied
Which makes it super good
YES
The best quote
yes indeed
Arsenic is wonderful
Arsenic?
the poison
i think it was
cyanide
the smell is of Arsenic
oh wait yea cyanide
same thing
cyanide was the bitter almonds
its a poison
yes
new leather was dead flesh
that sounds right
hmm
cadaverine
wait
actually idk
it sounds right
regardless
anyway
its a good story
it is a good story
akhil
what did you think of my story
hello\
did you understand it
send
did akhil read mine
for the third time
both of u pin ur stuff
here it is
hmm
its better than what it was before
it is no different
than what it was before
u added more details i feel
like blue dove bar
i changed nothing
this is the original version
huh then yea its fine
its pretty good
there should still be more impact
yes ik
also
do fish sing
it needs some work
but like
do fish
sing
look
literally like
why
you are weird
so idk
what
u might do
like
do fish
sing
also it might be some other animal
that sings
sigh
personification is a thing
im not gonna understand you
no
dont
im editing it
and tell me if u understand it
to make it a little clearer
please dont wait
no
here
its not bad
its intresting
ok correct me if i am wrong
but the MC is a patient?
basically yeah
ah makes sense
do you understand the title?
cause u mention purple, red and blue make purple
uh that actually works
but that wasn't what I intended
but that's actually a great interpretation
can i give you some hints
or is it something having to due with the line red was the sky or something
uh sure
there was another line
not red is the sky
ah
Let him see the red
and turn it to blue?
yes
and what is red
's
Fire
symbolism
what else
uh blood
oh is it a play on the idea
that blood is red and blue?
no not blood
there is another one
hmm
sigh
look at the context akhil
"beauty lies"
love?
yes
what does blue symbolize
Uh like stability
trust
the Sky
sadness
love is sadness?
yes
that is the title of the story
hmm it makes sense
does this entire story now
make sense to you
if I changed my title to be less puzzling
no keep it
like get it he chases her lies
and then gets sad
yea
but hes too weak
to sever his relationship
built on lies
so he tries to kill himself
and all his friends abandon him as a result
yea
man why yall make such sad stories
what could I do
to make it like
less confusing
its not confusing per se imo
its u just gotta think
cy doesn't like that
i feel like i could like make this
help
since it's not useful
this was part of another idea that I had for this story
but I can't include that
hmmm u can remove it
I would add something else instead
but here is my question
yeah
u rhymed the poem right
yes
it's a song
poem
whats the pattern
random
i didn't really think about it
i just wanted it to rhyme to have a rhythm
ok i would say try to have a pattern
hmm okay
I think there is a pattern at the beginning
like abab or abba baab
but it like goes away
yea
i think this does rhyme tho
abbc
yea but try to stick into a pattern
ok i have to pretend for gym
gl
we're not doing exercise
but still

gym
is over
i think
Nice
i was let out like 5 minutes ago
screw gym
there's also this other part of the story
like
"maybe I could have saved my life if I had told my parents or reached out to someone"
so that's what this has to accomplish
i showed my English teacher my story
and she told me
about mine
exactly
what i told u
about yours
its beautiful
and the style is great
that u should be more concise?
but its too ambiguous
I feel thats the point isnt it
you need to guide the reader more
it is
and she knew this
shes like
yes
its supposed to be ambiguous
i like that
but
thats the charm
its a little too ambiguous
its like making a game
a puzzle game
no its not supposed to be straightforward
but it also cannot be prohibitively difficult
so the challenge
mine is the same
wait
is finding how you can make it as ambiguous
i was quite literally
as possible
telling akhil the exact same thing
while ppl can still understand
and this measure
is almost always misrepresented
by the writer's interpretation
its like hatchbox
and so is mine
they are just
too hard
actually cy
i changed mine
im just saying what my English teacher said
ik
just like
read
you should show your story
to your
this one
english teacher
ill show mine
to my
10th grade english teacher
who
Dr. Kuscenko
Good teacher
i have Harding
shes also good
nah
dr. k is the best english teacher
meh
read my revised one
and see if it makes more sense
k its a bit clearer
but
there are some issues
what is red
what is blue
idk that
let me try something
red = love
blue = sadness
now substitute
and see if you get the entire thing
I mean I kinda get it
the problem is
what
1. I have already read it
and you have explained it to me already
no
i changed
like you have to undersatnd
ik but I already understand the story
the overarching idea
now
what happens
what happens
you told me
explain it to me
he looks back at his life
no
tell me what you understand
sings a song
yes no like
the song is his life
so what is the song about
since the song is like the story
i dont get the song
very much
hmm
this is kinda like setup
this is like
i already explained this
saving the baby
he sees sexual attraction
tires to pursue it
"she won't let him catch her light"
doesn't come to fruition
so his pursuit fails
it makes him hurt
it makes him lose hope in life
and his family can't see his suffering
k so
hold on
he's afraid of burning his friendship with her
he should really take the love and turn it into sadness
so
hold on
And I’d tell everyone to make the front pane can see the back, but I can’t.
but he can't
because they were friends once it means something
the friendship that is going to end shouldn't
this
means
and id tell everyone to make my family see what really happened, but i cant
cuz the front pane
is the family
and the back pane
i would have
like when i was suffering
is what happened
yeah
and his friends who knew about it
k so that was not clear
like
at all
make that clearer
actually yes
i agree
okay
i will do that
i was really confused what i wanted to write when I wrote this first
And I see both sides, but neither side can see the other; to them, the other side is obsidian
this
is also bad
for 2 reasons
so he tries to kill himself
without letting go of his love (since he can't)
it failed
obsidian is black
obscured
the reason it is bad
is that
1. it explains something to the reader - nothing should be explained that should be inherent - such as glass
ok actually this is confusing
2. It does not make sense unless you know that thing about the panes
you know like those windows
like
where you can see outside
but they can't see inside
variable referenced before assignment
k but then clarify that
say that these are one way windows
well they can only
see
the person
inside
not through the back of the pane
idk i think you need to work out
that whole glass thing
i think it makes sense
but
cuz it doesn't exactly make sense
like it makes sense sort of
when you use that line
but that line
is bad
cuz its like
hm
i think
saying
Huh wut?
that the glass
do you understand
is one way
like
without actually saying that
no it's not
and
like
it's not
udnerstand what
explaining
like
it
just
doesnt
stop texting cy
lemme see if i can get it
its bad
let me
tell you what im asking
it's
do you get
that
the family can see the child in the glass
but they cannot see through the back of the glass
yes they look with disgust right
and the school scene (if anyone were there)
can
see the child
but they can't see
the family
on the other side
i thought
it was that
no
thats a given right
it's not
the child could see them
this wasn't developed though
but not the other way
no
the glass does not symbolize this properly.
I think
change the glass.
they could see the child
it's implied
the
family can see the child
and the child can see the family
but not the other parties right
the family cannot see the school
the school can see the child
yea
the child can see the school
the school cannot see the family
its symbolsim right
yeah something like that
the problem is like
how we seperate our school lives from home
you are making
digital logic
EXACTLY
100%
out of like
glass
which
doesn't compute
huh?
fantasy
glass is transparent both ways
fantasy
no there is one way glass
but the rest of your story
is not fantastical
its
rather
literally like who cares
it's technology
not fantastical
that's not the focus of the story
but the reader will not understand
you could probably make something like this
i mean i did
yeah
the idea
is the symbolism
i reccomend you try and make a puzzle game
of family-school separation
and then
find out
how many hints you have to give ppl
before they can win
this is the same thing
i think it's kinda obvious
you think
it is
but
its not
but then why did akhil get it
after like
explanation
and after that line
?
the line
i can see
my family
about the glass
is bad
my family
the glass is not glass
can see me
it doesn't compute
it does not flow
my family
doesn't
see the friends
do you understand what i am saying
that line
the last one you sent
yes i get it
is bad
then maybe it's not glass
Cy is saying that that type of glass is impossible
then
but it has the texture and feeling
dont call it glass
is glass
i bet something like this exists
you need to choose something
for which
does he though?
that explanation is not required
yes
he doesnt have to say
he does
A one way plastic
no
i feel glass works fine
think harder
what
is something
i think the glass works fine
that meets
your needs
you can think about how it's possible later
you could use like
two one-way glasses stuck to each other
it breaks the flow
that wont work
see
then
the reader starts thinking
not this
about how
that is possible
and they get conflicting data
then i encourage them to
cuz on one hand
there's probably a way to do it
ur telling them
that its glass
that's like
which is transparent
not the point of the story
that is what glass is
but then
on another hand
u are telling them
oh so you think that it would confuse them?
that the glass has some magic properties
that prevent certain ppl from seeing certain things
but then like
and they would read too much
into the glass
its not glass
no
they just
wouldnt get it
without that line
and that line
or u could just say that both parties neglected to see each other
is bad
and must go
like
then i can't explain the symbolism
you
should not
i dont think anyone is reading to heavy into the glass
of the family-social separation
explain
symbolism
I agree
some people
like
symbols
don't tell their families about what they do with their friends
fundamentally
do not need to be explained
and don't tell their friends what they do with their family
unless you are doing worldbuilding
yeah that's the glass
and even then
you explain the object
then use it as a symbol
not all at once
idk all im saying is that
this line
in your story
was painful
to read
does it continue to make sense
without the line
no
it does not
exactly
that is why
you must
not choose glass
i think the glass has a charm to it
if you want this
yeah
from the readers
yes
i support the glass
it does
can we get additional data points
but this sketch is not solving
you are overconstraining
essentially
IPE
you are using a symbol
that requires explanation
but explanation is not allowed
so either remove the explanation and change the symbol
the entire story cy
is hinged
or remove the explanation and change the proposed meaning
on the symbol
honestly it could be glass with a privacy filter on it
then
it matters
i am pretty sure theres a way
yes, but no
that is ugly sounding
for example
lemme give an example
shsushushushsh
imagine
you wanted a box
that you could only see out of, not into.
then
you could use a box with small holes
that the character could look through
you do not need one way glass
you simply need
something entirely different
you are dealing with a conflict
and one side must change
either the symbol
or what you want it to mean
please
whatever you do
do not
explain
symbols.
im not
im
telling you what the symbol is
yes
you are telling me what it is
do not
do that
a lot of stories do this
look
they bring attention to it
if you want magic glass
you can first describe the glass
then
in a separate statement
say that the box is made from it
you cannot
say
that the box is made from glass
and then explain
that the glass is not actually see through
that distracts
and hurts
your flow
its one thing to describe a symbol
and another to explain or "tell" it
you can even remind ppl of what the symbol represents
like i do
just
cannot
define a magical object
like you did there
but alas
you do as you see fit
k im done
u can speak
at some point
when
idk whenever you want
maybe tmrw
cuz maybe there will be a snow day
but u didn't respond
they know best
and they are available resource for you
hi
you should listen to them
i dont know my english teacher
i know all my teachers
ask ur last year one
i might
if we dont have a snow day tmrw imma ask Mr Y about surveying
like
if u wanted projects
cuz i think its a good idea
yea
i might, might just piggy back off of ur idea and make a xcode app based on ur web thingy
but prob not
?
what web thingy
i have 15
any of them
yknow whats bad
why?
idk
"We are working on the issue, and service will be resumed momentarily"
-Cy
ah okay
yknow what i should do
did u figure out how to get email server up?
i should make readybeluga and hatchbox systemctl services
it half works
Cy and Matt if u want me just private dm me
this
It’s hard to find the @
They always get buried
use my cycloudd link
ha
ha
*scream
*anger
*sad
i erased
everything
similarly to how i erased hatchbox yesterday
cy is getting mad
things
are not
being done as per protocol
things are breaking
looks
has
an animation
ugly
cy just
came
to understand
the meaning
of life
the reason nginx kept crashing
was because of his involvement
in the .bashrc file
whatg ;alskdfj asdfsdf
now he understands
and now
he feels trust
in his server
red is blue
red is blue and love is sorrow
i have successfully
made
more than half
of my websites
be down
tell me please
how to fix nginx
no dont tell me
lemme hear what nginx has to say about this
tell me what this error means
see whats weird
is if i restart nginx
without doing anything
it unbreaks
and works
but when the pi boots
this happens
nvm the internet is a wonderful place
except that
like
actually
that error
is on an external server
that is always running
*sigh
um what
im watching some movie
ramesh
save me
later
from nginx
use
caddy
no
ramesh
life lesson
when someone asks you to help them with something
dont just tell them to use something else
i have done this to ppl
and they yell at me
and tell me
that if i were applying for a job with them
they would not hire me
that being said
i will examine caddy
cuz it seems interesting
k i solved my problem
by telling nginx
to just
wait
like
take a breath or two
let everyone around you get settled in
then start hammering them with requests
cuz it hammered cycloudd with a request before the pi was even online
this is the command btw
in case you ever need it
put it in your nginx.service file
above the others like it
Lets go
No school tmrw
Kinda bad kinda good
how u know
where it say
School called
the fone?
Yea

for anyone
other than me
si
k
alright
now
actually
nvm

for the statuspage to update
gee
this is not good
my statuspage makes me feel like not enough of my sites are down
it looks too
too
uniform
and static
i want more sites to be down

what
you just email the one on the poster
ima make some revisions
then submit
i also made some revisions
i am not reading urs again rn
i changed one line
i do not have time
neither am I yours
thats why im only changing very little
im just gonna make it slightly less ambiguous
but she said that like
uh
and maybe fix some of the paralellism
2 people submitted stories
not the teacher someone else
you and one other person
no like
2 other people before me
3 ppl so far
probably
maybe more
my friend might not know much
theyre probably all gonna sumbit like at 11:59
no one will submit
theres like
no incentive
meh
idk what im even submitting to
so like
it's a club
who will like read your story and choose one to publish on their website or something
k
imma make edits
then
do more homework
mhm
m hm
o right my stupid gym assignment is due tomorrow
i wanna add "flickers" by Wrabel to my radio on my site
its a really good song
i was satisfied enough when someone read my story and said it was "intriguing"
since like
that's what I got from yours
go do that then
my radio is down
and i
am not
putting it up again
right now
d'accord
And the next morning – it was he, who would not hear me speak, who would not hear my cry, when I did. It was he, who would not hear me tell of my woes; my woes for which there was now no one left there to listen.
why did you choose a he
you're not having enough gender diversity in this story
there are reasons
which
i will not
describe
did you submit yours
not yet
is my writing good
like not like
the story
the writing
didlss
your writing is good
um
i was gonna elaborate
but
i dont pay attention to didls
and stuff like that
i sort of
read with my own rules
but i can say that your writing sounds like that of a professional, like Brandon Sanderson
at a low level
speaking of brandon sanderson
you should consider
reading chapter 1
no
it's like only 2 pages
not really
but it won't be long
im not reading that book
im reading a different book
if ima read a book
please read it
it's like worth reading
i do too much else to be able to read books
it's like fun
that i am not interested in
you will
slowly
get interested in it
you will see what I mean
also i dont particularly like his style personally
that's literally
the first chapter
yes
that character's way is weird
and also
your story
like
i can tell
by your writing
this one is not
the like
the grain house one is
but this one is not so much
ima look at lists of good books on the internet
literally
just read the way of kings
find ones that sound cool
and are rated well
and then consider it
and are not fantasy
you are biased against fantasy books
you have to read a good one
i dont like mushrooms.
even if they are the best mushrooms
i dont like mushrooms.
that's like
i hate brussel sprouts
no matter how they are cooked
i hate brussel sprouts
and then you realize
there is another way to cook them
you can come to like something
if you need to
but
you can also choose something you find yourself to already like
if the consequences are not present
i hate linux
no matter what kind of linux it is
i hate linux
i dont hate
anything
so i wont try to like linux
i wont
consider
a new linux distro
that seems intriguing
but i have to delve further to see just how polished it
is
look ramesh
heres the scoop
im sure
with enough time
i could come to like worldbuilding
but you must understand
i have mental issues
i have a disconnect
between the 2 parts of my brain
my ability to read and understand
is directly proportional to interest and excitement
i cannot read 1000 pages
if i am not interested in them
ah but you see like
similarly
with ppl like you
what if
you can read 1000 pages in 3 days
you become interested in the 1000 pages
if you are interested
it took me
a month
to read the first book
what if i dont though
then dont
and i dont understand
but 1 chapter
isn't a good indication of that
1 chapter
that's not even related to the main plot of the story
i do not understand why we are arguing about personal preferences
books are like music
and movies
and design
they are a form of art
that strikes the mind
im not arguing about personal preference
and
it must
im simply trying to convince you
strike the mind
to read more of this book
in the right place
change that to plate, and you get a scene in the book
look next time i have time
literally
striking plates to get art
ill think about it
is a scene in this book
its just that
if i find myself counting pages
i did too
i was trying to finish it
so i could read the fourth book
there are books for which i do not find myself counting pages
i find myself enthralled
you may find yourself enthralled
but even at the end of part 1 you might not come to love it
the reallly good part of the book is towards the end of it
but hopefully it makes you interested enough you want to read to there
im not a fast reader
that's fine
i took
a month
reading no other books
to finish the way of kings
last year it didnt take me that long
it takes me 3 months
to read 300 pages
in the summer
well try it
if it fails
at least
you gave the book a chance
i dont have the time budget
also
if you dont wanna read this
read mistborn
it's shorter
also
and fantasy
i wanna read
and still good
something
you havent read
왜
*sigh
ha
ok imma like not
i have to sleep soon
i have to do 1 hour of math and 30 minutes of reading
and take a shower
and prepare everything for tmrw
to go to school
and sumbit this story
good night
good night
zoom just crashed
ahhhh
yay?
no
wait yea its def broken
ive been waiting for host to start meeting for like 7 min now

But its prob not
What has heritage to sand and the sun
It would have to be a plant of some sort
Huh it could also be a bike
my moms m1 mac came

Gym teacher: doesn't put the assignment's due date in Classroom
Gym teacher: emails me

WHY GOD WHYYYY
Covid-20 boys
Yup
I mean it was bound to happen
yup
But this is like the worst time
Bc we almost had the vaccine out to ppl
So now we gotta deal with 2 strains
where is it prevelent in?
We don't know, but so far the uk
thats their problem
Yuh
rn US gotta focus on Covid 19
then they can worry bout covid-20
Yea but it prob gonna spred
I mean its prob easy to beat that
Thats why they gotta make travel restrictions
just stop traveliing to and from the UK for a couple months
Cuz we hav existing reacherch
yea
So we only hav to change a few sequences
Yea but like essential travel like drs and packages and whatever
Might be a bit more than just a few
yea thats different
Yea but u know what I mean
i mean human travel
yea
I gtg back to my debate tournament bye
Have fun
the world is dying
plague v2
Ima bout to throw up my enchilada
I just won my first debate thing
ayyy
what event?
Nice
Congressional debate
intéressant
I b Nancy polosi
bruh
what was the competition's name
Cfl 3
mmmm
i have heard of that one
Like its a series of events
And u get points based on ur rank
And if u get enough u go to nats
interesting
my brother was very good at forensics
he got 3rd in nationals
Wowwww
What event
i think International extemp
Dude that is hard
U hav to know like tons of forghen policy stuff
yep IX
I checked online
mobile is becoming not garbage
Es bueno
ifone
skreen
rekord
safaree
plz
Is nice
skreen rekord?
Except it takes forever to load
Yes
Is sending
Those images r buggy sometimes
yea thats a safari mobile only issue
i have no fkin clue why
its like
no sense
No it happens sometimes with edge as well
it has never happened to me
on edge
but
it happens on my moms iphone
Ill scroll and all the images will disappear and stuff
yeah
ik
cuz
it annoys me
why
why is this
Idk
its like
probably something to do with the fixed backgrounds
here hold on
imma remove the fixed backgrounds
and then u try again
try again
skreen rekord
Its a bit better
But wtf is taking the website to “load” so long
i think its the audio
which is down rn
hey the images arent broken anymore
in that video
so i think
safari users
will get
another compatibility message
and will have their fixed backgrounds disabled
essentially there will be one compatibility message
"plz use edge or chrome bc ima not devote my life to browser compatibility"
"thx"
oh btw
ive spent like 15 hours with alankar
last 3 days
this is getting excessive
Yes please stop
Do you need help?
If so ask
click the egg
I understand that web dev is addictive
But its a gateway drug
To worse and worse things
we actually only did the web stuff today
R u joking
U want me to click that damn egg 2 million times?
yes
plz do
see its interesting bc like
and then his dad like
proceeds
to
buy
an EC2
Nice
hes a dev tho
so i was like
"do you want my help"
and alankar was like no
and i was like
then why did ur dad wanna know what linux distro i like
and alankar was like
"idk hes probably testing u"
Arch
The only answer
when he said this
Arch
i got like
into gear
and i started saying all the things
i was like
Arch
what provider are u using
and he was like amazon
and i was like vultr is chaper
and he was like shut up its fine
and then i was like
use nginx
regardless
we got an ec2
and hosted some things on it
although i think his father
is intending to use it for his website as well
cuz like
after i looked through the nginx config he put up
also
fyi
Let's Encrypt Authority X3
is now called R3
Huh
but
this is effective as of like dec 4

R3

i wanna try modifying the theme files
to change colors
i might like

no point in using the dev one
ill get the one on the website
that one works as well
thats easier to install
but u cant theme

unofficial repo
Red is gameboy i think
okay
yes
it is
so install the game boy one
and
dont press install yet
get the rom for red
okay
and add it with the custom file section
okay wait lemme do that
what should the file extension be for the rom
uh lemme check
.gb
for gameboy

ill probably install tetris on it
nes tetris
and leave it at that
also i think its a bug but
if ur gonna install using the repo thing
u gotta install everything again
congrats, i literally put this in the slides presentation
so if u try to install tetris, it will uninstall everything else so u gotta select khicas, gb em, red and tetris, and the other nes em
themes r jsons so u can change them as well
uh
how do I control it
Red?
Uh i think
Power is select
how do I make it like
bigger
my eyes are hurting
Idk thats how big it comes up
Thats gb size i think
what about NES
is nes any better
Its bigger
Wait lemme show u
ooh nice game

Send me the rom for this
I couldnt download one without a virus
yeah i dont want to hurt my head playing gb games
Its not the worst
Get gb color games

haha
its 2 mb
ok what games do I put for nes

i have zelda and super mario
Okay I'm using Chrome and installing tetris
and that's it
nice
since that's all I'll ever play if I have to play with it
and Khi
true
duh
i might get snake on it
or donkey kong
or 007
i wish
it supported snes
the zelda game for that one is good
i mean yea
but i dont think it can run it any good at that point
the gb version kept tearing
also toolbox is save
i mean mine does as well
but its not as bad
yeah nes emu is good
also
how do you like

in khicas, if you press shift clear
it clears the memory
covid-20
is bad
i want opinions
bad
what is bad
about it
also it has been updated a little since 15:28 today
there were issues with fonts and icons
Wait thats kinda cool
what
my website
or eve devices
this
ah yes
it is
its like a better surface
yes
that is their selling point
also
i need feedback
its okay
i personally dont like the design
why not
idk
it seems off to me'
what specifically
the font
the cover page
the colors
the blur
?
ig its the harsh contrast from the picture and the neon green
ok so about the neon green
i need a better monitor
cuz mine does not render colors
correctly
^ get this
its $1400 and not coming out until god knows when
but that being said
i would
if i could
i wanted an original V
when the original V came out
but i didnt wanna wait 3 months for it
i needed a new laptop for robotics
and i needed it soon
so i got the Yoga
looks cool and all
but hella expensive
i mean its not bad for the price
i just like
and u can add skins
want my website to be good
is there anything other
its not bad
that you have to say
uh u know that menubar
at the top
yes
i would shift it to the right
so right align it
and have the logo on the left
yea
i would do that
i was considering it
but i decided against it
because
then the logo would appear twice
and
makes sense cause big logo
the logo does not look good small
its actually a t-shirt design
have the logo appear when you scroll past the huge cover thing
also does the cover fill ur screen?
no
its supposed to only fill 80%
notice their covers
only take 80%
yea they r pretty similar
hmm i think thats everything else then
just the bright neon green
and right align
idk about the right align
but i will take your opinion
and ask everyone else
theirs
and see
also
on my website
what do you think
of the angled menu items
i like it
i see
k thx
..........
its like
the art
is it for sale?
of making props and stuff
but
in a 3d printer
no
well maybe
as like a one time thing

yup

looks kinda cool
cyberpunk
Yes
Bruhhhhh

алексей навальный на ютубе
No it's dead
Until I work out https
:(
Https being my dilemma
non
I need to have a reverse proxy
That doesn't touch ssl
then don't
use https
in nginx
I need to have a stable reverse proxy on my nextcloud server
use nginx
And it cannot mess with https
if you
configure nginx right
it won't
To localhost 444
,m.wait
my keyboard
im pressing random buttons on it
yes
you can do it with nginx i think
This tutorial said to use HAproxy
how do I CHANGE THE LIGHTING MODE ON MY KEYBOARD
nah just use nginx
i gotta read something for english
They said it's a lot harder
Cuz u have to use streams
I don't think imma go to tec
I have things to do
Did u hear that piracy of movies and music could now get up to 10 years in prison and a felony
No
oh no
Yeah it got snuck into the covid relief bill
Wtf
Covid relief bill
DMCA
Yeah
><
My nextcloud is going down
While I deal with this reverse proxy stuff
I hate typing on phones
Maybe I need a bigger phone
Cy r u doing tech club
I have things to do
In anyone in here in ap comp sci
yes
why
only kinda *
cough
how do you do the final coding bat
it makes no sense
what does it look like
send me a picture
i can probably tell you
I dont get the order it returns for expected number 2
link me to the codingbat
you should
loop through with i+=2
right
yeah
it's not even numbers
it's even indices
im so dumb
ok
np
yeah
indicies
akhil and ramesh are online
ok
ramesh suggests
We did it
for my https problem
i made an omega theme
cool
to use nginx
hmm
i mean u should always use nginx
my main issue is this
firstly nginx requires setting up a stream
to do this
which may be unfun
and 2
be it HAproxy or Nginx it needs to have if/else logic
else go there
why?
cuz this is an upstream reverse proxy
it only takes what is for the nextcloud
and gives all other https traffic
to the pi
it does no ssl
ssl is handled by apache on the nextcloud server
and nginx on the pi
hmm
this is the issue
i search "how to make nginx/haproxy route all OTHER traffic"
but i get not result
well hold on
same way you always do
every connection has a hostname associated with it
has akhil not done reverse proxy before
then why dont u just filter that request, but have it not reject the request
i havent
i see
well this is just a syntax issue
i have no need for one
i have many need for one
cause i have seperate machines for all my stuff
all running at my house
i already have a reverse proxy
but i wanna notherone
for https
that is stable
and upstream
cuz it has to handle nextcloud
which has to be stable
cuz my family uses it
ramesh knows how to solve this issue
please solve this issue
apparantly the judges like my story
according to ramesh
what was that story even for
fun
and Devil's Quill
ahh
also
tell me your opinion of
design wise
Maybe a darker theme
k
anything else
about section centered or a pic on the left
k
and if a pic a smaller box under the text
k
ok
thx for ur feedback
np looks good though
different purposes cy2 is just a series of links and 4h is more info driven
i see
what do u guys do at 4H
komputers
is it like comp sci club
yeah kinda
but the ppl are younger
like
middle/high school
and a 10 year old

I dont think so
One of the biggest players in the issue of Gender Stereotypes is Stereotype Threat. Stereotype Threat is the fear of conforming to a stereotype, and, in effect, proving it true. The main effects of stereotype threat are increased stress, and changes in decision making, which can affect the outcomes of tasks that are being done by people experiencing stereotype threat. For example, girls in education, especially in MSE, Math, Science and Engineering, may experience stereotype threat, because stereotypes tend to exclude them from these environments. This consequently results in increased stress, and in turn lower retention of information and lower test scores. Studies found though, that what you told these stereotyped individuals before they took the test had an effect on how much they experienced stereotype threat. So if you told them that girls generally tend to do better on this test, they would perform better. Gender stereotypes and stereotype threat also exist in sales and finance. Studies found that when
except it cannot sound scripted
Pause and say um sometimes
so i did a speak-script with highlights
Hmm here and there
ikr
Pretend to lose your thoughts
Its a skill
Called
Deception
no i have that skill
and i also
actually lose my thoughts
the thing is i cannot look at the script
i have to be looking at his eyes
i can glance at the script
i think i got it pretty good
i just practiced
now i need to do the same thing for another section
learn to use OBS
and maybe listen to a little music
cuz why not
before 5PM
Prerecord ur stuff
no
Prerecord a video
this is live
tmrw
in class
Play it during zoom
Oof
questions will be asked
i meet with my group at 5
we finish our TMP
then we rehearse
and ideally we record as well
as a test
im actually not taking down my nextcloud server
not until break
cuz i might need it
between now and then
unless i can get the whole thing up and running tonight
which is unlikely
meh ill just upload my TMP to youtube
that way mr y doesnt get greeted by a nice connection actively refused page
hes a communication guy
he doesnt like it
when ppl activley refuse his requests
to communicate
americans do not listen to Emily Burns
at least on spotify
but then for like all the other ppl i listen to
its like
chicago
and dallas
and chicago
and dallas
i should stop listening to music and do AP seminar
so imma do that
also i figured out obs
you install it
click auto configure
then you click add desktop
then you click record
not gonna say it couldnt be simpler
but its ez

are going to stay free
and not giving them to free ppl
so i might be fine
but i might not
je n'aime pas
They would just sell some leaks from the ccp
the thing is it is really unsustainable to run something like this free
hes like
"i have been funding it from my own money"
which tbh is probably pretty easy for him
hes like some billionaire
Like it was found on telegram that there were 1.9 million ccp members around the world
and telegram is awfully well optimized
I mean
i have to do my PE scavenger hunt.
Telegram does not rly need any improvement
Same
signal
is a messaging platform
yes
What does it say
Uh interesting
Now
Is the story actually
On that website
Oh

cuz for some reason i concluded it could not be done with icecast
wait what

the end of the video there's a shazam
oh yes there is
pop-up shazam
on my home screen
cy uses an apple product
haha
its good
I too use shazam
its the best
it barely works
and it works on android wear
but it is the best
it always works
Okay
lemme
give you a video
i pretty much exclusively shazam from my watch
i have a button dedicated to it
tell me
what song is in this video
tf
yeah mhm that sounds right
let me see
this is a romanian song
with lyrics
it is not this
you like that kind of music
no
the kind in the video
not that one
like the ifixit video
don't blame me
blame shazam
bc you tried to shazam it
ppl shazam things they like
that song is probably custom tho
someone at ifixit probably made it
like this video
doubt
so cloudflare has blocked more attacks
than it has served ssl requests

I haven't opened presents yet
And desk
Panatoneee
German Christmas bread thing
O
It looked like a panatone
It's probably similar
Yuh
Although I think panatone is more fluffy
Not rly
It has the same colored raisins
I think a lot of things have similar raisins/things like those
It looks similar to like a tutti frutti cake
?
This
Never seen it before
I see
My german family makes it
So my dad makes it
Idk
Probs a regional thing
My fam is from Hesse
Prob
My dad says his mother grew up in magdeburg
Mågdeberg
this is what i dont get
what is wrong with it
like
santa got me a vakoom kleenr
cuz i has dust
and reallly well done
that's
considerate
i turned it on
and then
and it worked
for 10 seconds
then
it came to an end
brand what
what brand
i suppose it wasnt charged
Gezundheit
ill charge it and try again
ha
looks like some random thing
its a black and decker
dustbuster
and its loud as hell
especially when ur under a desk
and it echoes
but its better than walking all the way to the closet to get the central vac tube
i need xplanation
it's just
awful
the font size is bad
the scaling is bad
the colors are bad
why dont u make me a prototype
no
why
I am doing my own things
not your things
fine
like
you can fix it
the font size is awful
idk alankar liked the site
box-shadow is overrated
?
this square
just
objectively looks better without a box-shadow
that square
has an outline
no shadow though
filled squares
need shadows
it doesn't appear to pop
this is not 2013
we use shadows
i hate choosing shadow color
whatever
that is ugly
is this
um
no shadow
no
ha
idk shadows are needed here and there
it depends on the design tho
I may copy this
that is not a shadow
that is like
I know
an abstract shadow
but it makes it pop
this looks
not terrible
is bad
dont care
why
uh
since
im lazy
when i tell ppl about ramesh
and they go there
haha
and its ugly
ill just replace it with the previous version
which was better
it doesnt work on mobile
and the fonts
and boxes
and icons
are bad
"ramesh hates"
"mobile devices"
"cy doesnt hate"
the thing is i have no motivation to fix it
"anything"
since like
it's already so bad
i mean just make the background black
change the font
kevin said
that was bad
round the boxes
i had it at black once
kevin
please show me kevins websites
firstly
his website is off white
which is completely different
from off black
secondly
it doesnt work on mobile
and thirdly
why cant fonts just support japanese fml
its not secure
fml?
for my life
ah
what site is that button on
this
is a file
not published anywhere
what is it for
do you wanna make a new website for devilsquill
no
this song is interesting

But we made it work
AHHHH HELP

Yeah
One sec
Once I’m done downloading some steam games
I’ll go into the bios
Ok
what
make sure it's named GIGABYTE.bin
and
then it works
did you enjoy the suffering
while you thought you bricked your board
We used the wrong flash drive
noice
what gpu though
Random one from cu
I haven’t gotten mine yet
We j got one that would post
oh

I can try your server
is just too long
How
Cy
yes
Your'e not cy

Iot stuff is fun
I haven't dont anything with lora
Hmmm

from those years on zoom classes
windoze bad
windows on raspberry pi
is good
its fast
and its better than linix for a desktop environment
that is
once they fix sound
not true
and wifi
it is true
on Raspbian
the fonts
are bad
in krome
and there is no edge
and half the programs u wanna run just dont
cuz arm
on windows
these are not issues
AHHHH
How did you even do that Sam
IDEKKKK
This is the buos^
How the frick do u change xmp profiles
linus tek tips
This profile is 3600
what is the speed of ur ram
But it won’t work
3200
I believe
I see
um
Lemme check
sam
enable
xmp
No it’s 3600
idk how to do ram tuning
i like
didn't
do that on my pc
you should ask ramesh
um
idk
i just set mine to 3200
like
i enabled xmp and then set the multiplier
then it works
the end
uwu
Issue solved
We looked in task manager
yes uwu
UWU
And we we’re good 😎
so am i
soon
soon
Should I get some led stripes?
strips yes
This is all the lighting I have
oof that's bad
which kraken tho
X63
same as mine
yees get some
my mobo has some lighting too but not much
Bruh it’s been a constant 45 even while plying cpu intensive games 🥺
really
that is nice
linux can't track zen3 temps atm
Oh rly?
yeah
but in a few days
it will get updated
and i can
im getting a new mobo soon uwu
what is this garbage
cy has an issue
see
in his house
the router is in the basement
but
there is an access point in the exact middle of the house
perfectly placed
but
he cannot manage more than 400mbps over this access point
and he suspects
that this is due to the access point being connected to the router over coax.
ip over coax advertises 700mbps
uhm
what if the router is throttling
why would it
idk old linux router thingy right so uh
it get lliike
i mean heres the thing
overheat
so im testing
by running an iperf server on my nextcloud server
which has a GbE connection
to the router
I need to order two power supplies
i tested
from my pi first
which also has a GbE connection to the router
and it got 940 mbps
with iperf
now tho
from that access point
over wifi my phone gets 370 mbps
and over ethernet my phone gets 450 mbps
and my laptop
over ethernet
gets 240 mbps
and over wifi
gets 2 mbps
sigh
that
is a router issue
why
just like
if the wifi is slower
it's either a router issue or your wifi card is horrible
yes that is a
well my laptop is bad
laptop wifi
bad
yeah
my laptop will get 500 mbps over wifi in school
and 1.2 gbps over ethernet
in school
but i tested from my phone
to avoid this issue
uhm
poor wifi network configuration
but why wouldnt it be the coax
thats the issue
if you
plug into ethernet
on THAT router
what do you get
you mean on the coax AP
on the coax AP i get 450 mbps to my phone over ethernet
your phone
has ethernet.
no im using a usb ethernet adapter
for all the tests
on laptop and phone
sigh
uhm
why are intel cpus so cheap idk what to buy anymore
ik it is not the bottleneck because it has given me gigabit speeds
ok
and the coax router
gives you fast speeds
on your phone?
the speed i search
is 1gpbs
okay like
i mean
normal speed
not 2mbps
like
more
than that
yes it gives me normal speeds on wifi
okay
what about
your laptop
running lunix
my laptop runs windows
what about
your laptop
running lunix
i dont have it ready atm
literally just get
a
usb
and
do
things
*sigh
just do it
and tell me what you see
i have elementary os on a usb stick
do that then
and i dont think it boots on my laptop
ok then use the like
the
most linuxes dont boot on my laptop
ssd
no that ssd is in my pc
and im not turning it off rn
i think i should test my phone's network interface
to see if it can do gigabit
no just
Asdafadagshdahsfs jumper cables
cy is satisfied
because
he just figured out
that the raspberry pi has a fully functional serial console
that is already enabled
and can be accessed on serial0 at 115200 baud
which means
if you need to do network testing on a raspberry pi
and you need to use it "headless"
without a monitor
and networking is not guaranteed
so you cannot use ssh
you can access it over the serial terminal
using a donor arduino
on the Arduino:
you just use a jumper to short the reset pin to ground
which disables the microcontroller
then you connect ground, tx, and rx to the pi
and plug it in to ur computer
then you use putty
the serial terminal is very limited
it is fixed size
and black and white
because the rs232 protocol does not have support for text color or dynamic terminal size
but it works
and cy is happy
corning is the only company allowed to have their logo look like this
because their business is literally glass
Lmao
Uh my 5800x just jumped to 4.9 ghz is that normal?
Yes
faster?
My gpu won’t show in task manager
Nah it's too trash for that
Is it seated properly
Our gpu
It's his now
No it's still mine
You guys share a wife?
And he's gonna return it
Yeah once I get mine
If*
Yea w8 why he hav ue gpu
Ur
I have none atm
I'ma watch tv with my dad
Bye
I’m waiting for a rtx 3080
*ur wife
Bruhhh
This book im reading is so goooood
That will never arrive
Hmmm
Im not even kidding i saw this and i thought it was a picture of an anime girl idk how
Wtfffff y u need ryzen 9
Because it was in stock
If I’m able to should I j get a rx 6800xt
Like most of the games I play are strat games don’t need rtx
Yes
Or a plain 6800
i got fios gigabit
but im on wifi
so its more like fios third of a gigabit
Yuh
The big sad has begun
No cpu installed, press f1 to continue

winter break is the time to binge watch ben eater
his videos are like 30 minutes long
Can I eat ben eater
but theres like 12 in each series
Time to take out the most stupid dumb pc case ever invented
Like you think engineers are dumb... And then you realize there is a whole new level of stupidity at Rosewill
Yes
That looks like a Rosewill employee
cy wants to go to best buy
Except it's Cy and Cy is smarter than a Rosewill employee
he wants RAM
and SSD
and a monitor that represents colors
XDR display
see his dad
gave him a paper for christmas
that said
cy can go to best buy
and spend $200
Ur missing a zero there bud
no
Get this
Best display for color
Its only what
Like 4000$
seven and a half
used convertible pontiacs
Yea but a pontiac doesnt give u accurate color does it?
true
the thing is
the ram and ssd
are gonna be like $200
or maybe $150
total
i also wanna see the pixel 5
but not buy it
What ram u getting?
16gb?
16gb
Nice
although i have to match the speed to my current ram right?
Think so
i also want a 1tb ssd
alternatively tho
i could just get another 512gb
Get this
+ pcie raid card
I dont think u need raid
me neither
Get this
k
Cause u have like a 50gb swap
which brand tho
The cheapest one
k
Kingston mabye
i currently have the cheapest one
i have the micro center store brand
i just woke up
imma eat breakfast
bye
bike pedals are 9/16 of an inch correct?
Hi I'm lost
Hi
That's like half an inch
What dimension
?
i mean the size of the hole the pedal fits into in the crank arm thing
cause mine is stripped
so i gotta tap it to 5/8
then add a metal insert
You mean where the foot thing attaches to the arm
yes
I could imagine that being 9/16
it prob is
its just a hassle to tap it to 5/8
I see
Interesting
오늘은 12월 30일이야
don't
t
don't
guess what it means
idk
im just like
*cygh
taken aback
by the fact
at how
that
detailed
windows
with commands
etc
get help
is telling me
to "open an elevated command prompt"
yes
as if im actually not some dumbass consumer
ooh cy is swearing
interesting
the troubleshooter is actually working
extremely interesting
ramesh is writing atm
cy is updating windows atm
then hes gonna go to best buy
and buy RAM
and eat it
we'll see about that
now that the "get help" is working
I did it
Nice
Why?
Ah i see
If i put anything before wildcard its gonna change it right?
yes
Nice
R u gonna use this for ur web proxy?
tbh idk what imma use it for
i just wanted to know that it was a thing
im trying to get a email server working
yes
Nice
its been an hour
when can i get the new windows update
Windows has a built in system scan?
Im assuming it does system integrity and stuff right?
tbh i have no idea
this is what windows help told me to do
huh
i never trust tech support people
no this was the automated help
i never trust tech support bots
i just dont trust the entire department
cause they r never quick
they take forever
huh
well have fun
at least its at 69%
its at 74 now
awwww
not nice|
|[]|
now you see
i need to figure out ssl on a wildcard
i still wanna go to best buy
nice
best buy is great
i can never get stuff from there tho
they all expensivo
I checked ram prices
and theyre kinda the same everywhere
also I mainly wanna go so I can see the fones and the komputirs
hasnt the ram market calmed down
like before they were kinda expensive
meh theyre still not as cheap as I would like them to be
now gpus r expensive
my dad uses gpus for ai
pretty sure like a 1080 is 500$ or something
well his colleague
they have big boy computir
with 256gb ram
oooooo
sometimes they need more tho
so they go to google cloud
thats the machine for you
never have to use a swap ever
and u get all ur icons
yes
my ikons
i wanem
is it a PC or like a mac pro?
its not a mac i can tells u that
1.5tb of ram
it's a mac
mac pro
cheese grater
its probably linix
linix
my dad still has equipment running on MS-DOS
Dang that old
lazirs kost a lot of money
they kost kwarter of a million dowers
that a lot of money
my dad has lazirs
oops
wrong chat
the one you stand next to all the time
oh no
hmm
i wanna go to best buy
imma go ask my dad
to go to best buy
bye
nice
idk why port 25 wont open
wrong chat
haha
Wow I love Linux
i see
Yes
you see
Quiz
how do you exit an angry ssh session
that froze
today's junk
ehh
why is it ehh
cause its an ehhh game
its bad
you've played it?
but not the worst out there
seen gameplay
E.T. for the atari 2600
was that good or bad?
just look it up
you will see
Oh god
its bad
yep
thats not good
at all
they buried the game?
sounds like cyberpunk lol
damn
yea
except cyberpunk isn't that bad
its not
its pretty fun
that's good
havent had any bugs
you've finished playing it?
not even close
im like 6 hours in
ive just been doing side missions
WoR > Cyberpunk
this is awful
i should be getting much higher than this
iperf3 time
is dead
aw
thats sad
making progress
cy got an mx master 3
and 32 gb of ram
Nice
I dislike the look of the 3
But it has usb c
tbh im not sure what I think of it
its like better
but also
not
I love my 2
Once u start using that side button
U cant go back
the wheel or the button?
I too have a side button
I want one
The button
On the side
there are 3
my problem is the scrolling
its sort of
messed up
The one under ur thumb
oh that one
i have it set to show desktop
I have it set to mission control
idk its just a little off to the left
i have to move my thumb
Mine fits right there
Its the forward and back
That i have to move
But i barely use those
i like the forward and back
i have mine not set to that
i have the top one set to pan
I just reprogram them
?
Program them per application
and the bottom one set to pause
so i can essentially scroll using only the top one
and then i have the pause and volume on the lower button and the side wheel
since those are 2 handed gestures on my keyboard
Mine change per application
idk like i said my main issue is the scrolling
it sort of
lags
?
Ik it has direction issues
But it lags?
idk i guess im just not used to an inertial scroll wheel
Set it to smart shift
my old mouse had a light rubber one
so if you let go
it stops
instantly
^
its like that out of the box
Is it?
yes
Idk smart shift is the best
I like both click and speed
ramesh is gonna buy stuff at micro center tomorrow
Nice
Happy new years yall
Havent seen u guys for a year
Happy new year

ramesh is trying to do something with a udp socket server
Nice one
indeed akhil
Yes
good
im getting better
U r
faster and faster
you won't be able to catch me soon enough
We shall see about that
우리는 보겠네
you know when the messages come in as notifications

i know
I don't like that
They should
yeah
But pretty sure jt deletes the message when u edit it
Ah “{:?}”
Akhil

and lists
Huh

upload anything yet
i didnt
k
um
maybe try something smaller
no
make it bigger
um
there is no limit
i uploaded
a
750mb file
i think cloudflare is mad at you
try a smaller file
like an image
why does ramesh
try to break things
I like
breaking things
my name is calum
even calum doesn't do that anymore
github
can go die
idgaf about how this sounds like it's slavery
i literally
do not
give
a
h*ck

Twist tie
Twist Cie
Ouau
How do you say wow in french

dunno the rest
Mono Lisa
yes
La Joconde
no
:(
she doens hav eyebrows
No need to call her out
i wanna make translatebot work
Do it
but i need to set up some proxy
that doesn't interfere with my ssl
the question is how to do this
Magic
and the answer may be HAproxy
So magic
yeah
ima read up on haproxy
and ima not go to bed at 2 today
ima do homework
l8r
Wow
The links don’t work
its an xperiment
i spent like 5 hours on it
and didn't spend a second
on making working links
hi
my name is cy
Yes
Hussein coming in clutch
see this is exactly the opposite of what i want
i want ssl non-termination
i want ssl passthrough
Cy I have no clue what you’re talking about
But yes
ok essentially this
ssl is a pain in the ass ok
but
my nextcloud server
deals with it for me
so
i want a reverse proxy
that just passes all the ssl stuff through
so nextcloud can deal with it
and not me
then
but
now
since i have a proxy
i can get all the non nextcloud ssl traffic
and deal with it on my experimentation server
without disturbing nextcloud
which my dad uses
Yes I now have a 1% understanding
that is an infinite amount more than before
i feel accomplished
ima watch this
Ok gl
wait wtf is this something i did actually worked
haproxy is actually good
i like haproxy
now i can install certbot on my pi
that runs all my sites
I hate
web dev
Fight me
cy is so mad
and it was all gonna work this time
it was all gonna work
and now
use cloudflare
it will
automatically https
i am
but
certain things
require actual https
and i wanted to set up wildcard ssl
so it would be done
once and for all
can share an ssl certificate
No
I tried that once
nightmare
why
dns records werent updating
no you dont understand it is working
it just wouldnt renew —dry-run
this is annoying
and then
every
single
event
has to be
because the python cloudflare version was out of date
put into a queue
but now
i updated it
And wait
this is wrong
wait
stupid
I have to update all the types to Arcs now
and then letsencrypt comes and tells me i cant
since the reference is being passed into a thread
like
get the same certificate
more than 5 times per week
and guess what
my refcell
needs to be changed to a mutex
except
that wont work
and then if I use an RwLock that wont work either
actually
an RwLock might work
multithreading is fun
i am going to retrieve my deleted key files from my filesystem
ramesh has concluded
an RwLock will work
the final solution was more complex than an RwLock
yogart is almost still a thing
50% chance akhil even remembers that he did that
YOGART
bruh i remember that
why would i not
make it permanent
nothing is permanent
ima listen to dr p
bye
indeed this may work
this may work
Nice
u has mac
I have a mac
oh god
*Yann
why
^
why what
dont
big sur looks ugly as heck
install
10.16
im still on catalina
im installing
and plan on staying on it
the latest
10.15
install 10.15
no
im installing 11
oh god
tbh 11 looks much nicer
nooooooo
install windows
i need macos
for what?
no, you don't.
literally
whatever can be done on macos
^
because things need to be tested
can be done on windows
and linux
in macos
can be done on linux
can be done in windows
and i need an iPhone simulator
drop mac support
today
drop ios support
Oooh
have fun with the required 100 dollar license
for certain ios development features
i'd sooner drop linux support
u dont need to
why
u need 100$ to pay to get an app on the store
i just need to see if certain things work on iPhone and mac
I'd gladly offer windows and linux
yep
everything else will work without one
and also if i ever actually need to make an app
like for real
like for 4h
then 1
i need a mac
and 2
i can pay the $100
so i can get it on ios
its sad but whatever
cy
stop being attracted
i mean i heard from the guy who did the 4h fair app
to apple products
he was like
that is if it passes the three month wait time
it has costed us $400 so far
and
they rejected us
because
an ad
^
Yes have fun it's APPLE
for our app
said
^
"get it on Google Play"
wrong gif
right one now
dont plan on making an app and publishing it through app store
yes
ill just figure out how to implement PWA
and be done
web dev
is stupid
fight me
what is it with rust
rust is fun
have you ever gotten a web app to work on ios
ur not gonna use rocket?
like used one
I have
which app
ive made one
hold up wdym web app
it uses
udp sockets
hold on
not http
gimme a moment
ah
bonk
nooo
dont send me to jail
http horny jail
haha
time to get the rpi up so i can do the ssh thingy
I needa implement
PartialEq
whats partial eq?
ik assert eq is if they are equal
to compare
structs
if they are equal
huh
my phone is being slow as heck
idk why
its not even hot
easy
get an iphone
mehdi sadaghadar
pwaa!
this is cursed
?
nope
?
wdym nope
its an app
that's a web app
idk any ios apps like that
oh
um
theres no option to download an app
apple doesnt even support downloading apps outside the store
Ah ramesh is stupid
he doesn't add the guesses to the list
on eyeohesse
pwa
but notice how mehdi's site opens as an app whereas mine opens as a website
my mak is almost ready
wow apple is wonderful
they like
broke
the setup
i clicked "continue"
and it went back a step
then i clicked continue
and it broke
and went back 2 steps
then it broke
and went back another step
tf is this graphics memory
no
no
not that outline
no
my 3mb of gpu memory have failed me i guess
why does macos look so ugly
ah this
asdfasdf
sdfgsdfgsdfgqasdfg
it looks awful
idk
now heres the question
can I now
switch to VMware player
idk
use kvm
cuz this is workstation pro
osx-kvm is nice
well im thinking cuz like
theyre both VMware workstation
so could I just take the files
and run them in player
me when I was an apple user
Yes
Young Cy
looks like
1980s cy ngl
so apparently minimizing safari breaks macos
those grafix are too intense
imma give it more processors
it has 4 rn
I giv it 12
and I giv it 16gb ram
wait I have to replace ctrl+c with win+c
yea
im installing edge
the problem is it like locks
every 5 minutes
nope every 2 minutes
its like it has to respring
cuz that's what apple things do
sldhfkjashdlfkjha it dies every time I click anything
i hate how the red x does not actually terminate the app
it just like
minimizes it
alright
wait what
I mean it's higher than I thought it'd be
its the same as mine
the graphics tho
are like
so bad
garbae
i tried imessage
um
VMware has some sort of direct memory access
well like software DMA
cuz
it doesn't show up in task manager
but im only at 50% overall memory usage
i am getting the ifone simulator
first i need excode
excode is taking forever to download
its 9gb
its going faster now
wow apple
you don't know how bad it is?
I already read this
it's funny
its funny that they dont like
or that they do like
put reviews from 3 years ago
as the second review
on their own software
im dying
one is air
the other is dioflourinethane
why is dioflouruoennadsadethane weird
?
i actually used the sequences feature
during lab today
ik its useful
but y is it doing this
as;aslkdfj;alskdfj;asldkfj excode
not 100% yet but whatever
its taking firevir
ik how to fix it
i dont understand what you are making
this uses
ill let you play too
multiplayer
after I fix this
it should work multiplayer
oh wait im on macos 11.0 beta
that's probably why everything is buggy
tell me why this is the icon for file manager
like as a logo ok
but as the icon for the file manager?
MULTIPLAYER WORKS
Cy
can you try my game
yes
and see if you can connect
okay
lemme push the stuff
and see how to get it to work on windows
this is why you do web dev
no
I hate web dev
so you dont have to make different versions for each os
and have each os
I dont
i just have to build it
although you kinda have to do the same thing with web dev
you need mak
to test
loading
Building slowly
shoot i accidentally minimized safari
wait
it didn't break
ok
yes
no
that only took two and a half hours
the problem is theres no app store
asdfasjfd;jasf
cy
do you have mingw2
I hate windows
I literally hate it
i do
ok wait
i also have wsl
wsl
is junk for this
for what
compiling?
it depends on a library
why dont you compile it
i am
so you can
LINK : fatal error LNK1181: cannot open input file 'csfml-graphics.lib'
literally
the file
is there
shoot i minimized safari
and shoot
i did ctrl c instead of win c
?
if you minimize safari the mak locks up for like a minute
Ohhhh
Haha
I have smoooth
trying to do that animation
anyway now i have an iPhone simulator
so i can test things on ios
Nice
cy is mad
now his android emulators dont work
because they require some windows thing to work on AMD
that i disabled
a;sdlkfja;sldkfj
use linux
cy
do you have logmein hamachi
i cant ngrok
?
what do you need to do
wait
lemme run mine
make
no account
just install logmein hamachi
and join my network

done
now what
comin
lemme figure it out
dont just click
wait
go to target/debug/
then open cmd
yes
then
type
udpclient.exe 1
what happens
This is legit a virus
right wait
Gl
lemme send you the font
now
put this in target
then try it
target/debug
not target
also the UI is kinda bad but idc rn
it's not
k it worked
does it show a bunch of boxes
yes
are the boxes
filling in
yes
are the attempts changing
yes
ok
guess
stuff is not implemented yet
like chosing other certain gthings
also it might do anything
you win
nice
you can also make a game and I'll join
close it
and then just
udpclient.exe
no args
k
guess
lemme see
oh it logs the word
haha
It works though
the prototype works
ok thank you for testing
i will deal with that
you will deal with communism
later
HAHAA
I get it
bye hamachi
you can look at the code if yə wã
it's
U gonna publish to crates?
when it works
this is like
REALLY early prototype
cy wil agree
Secure the name
yə cã lək e ðə cõ
later
Just make release v0.0.1
no not yet
Yea later
should i make the same thing
with web dev
Yes but it'll be less fun
i need to learn how to use sockets
^
websockets
this uses like UDP
or something
I also need to learn sockets
Oh god
But im lazy
?
I do
soemthing
and then everyone else be like:
haha
how does this do the connection
do i create a UDP server
when i make a game?
I aint making what u did dont worry
sigh
I know
this
idk
i did something
what
Hes a genius
Why does the rpi flasher take forever
i added stuff
a low quality video of cy very sadly poking the black screen of his google pixel on stock android 11
in dark mode
cy likes pixels
cy's pixel is broken
sad pixel
its not worth $90 to fix it tho
not until i stare at it long enough that it becomes worth it
scrcpy is a thing
I told you about this before
but it defines a new category of hand-eye coordination
I like scrcpy
to poke a black screen
in the right spot
yes
its easier than it seems
but
i like it
what do you think
i see you dug that out
im looking for a screenshot
Gas laws
fun
anyone do this one?
ima try it and see what I get
no i got it now
ok
i can help u tho if u need
nah
k
chem easy
well this one it was like
wet gas
and im like
is the dry gas
does it have a different volume
cuz u remove the water
but no
yea, we had lab question on that
i didnt
and I had to ask the almighty alankar
haha
bruh
cy
yes
i am trying to host my website
like small html thing
i can do that for you
how i do
its just an html page?
yuh, just for seeing how to host it
um
then ima do some css and java script
you can use hosting providers
or
u can ask me
and i host it on my server
bc it ez
i wanna try and self host it
for learnz
ㅗ
but when i finish
you can do that but u need port forwarding
can u host it
and nginx
i made a port
and a pi
to run all the time
ok
u hav domain?
no
send html
but im trying to get free one from github
ok
i stored file in one drive so it takin a bit do download
i see
do the draggy drop to the tewegwam
finally
it is just a giant picture of elon musk
and words
oooooooo
omg
that is
the most
beautiful
yuh
how i host tho
yup
um
you can use GitHub pages
you can use
cloudflare pages
you can use
replit for dynamic/service sites
you can self host
or
then ima self host
you can use Cy2 Hosting
you can just give me ur domain
then i put it on ur domain
in my nginx config
im trying to get a domain from GitHub student dev thing
ok
yup
i was like, what is the best thing to write
and i was like, that
ewon musc
yuh
ima add css
and see what happen
then when you get a domain
you can put it on cloudflare
for easy https
or
force me to use certbot
which i need to learn
and i already learned
ima try cloudflare
over break
yes that is better
although it is not actually secure
which doesn't matter
i mean
if they wanna see elon musk smoking pot
its only secure between users and cloudflare
so it appears secure
go ahed
but then
between cloudflare and your server
its not secure
o
but no one cares about that
unless there is user data being transmitted
so they offer this "flexible" option
they call it
so u dont have to deal with actual ssl
they just do the ssl for u
via the proxy
ooooo thats nice
my sites use this
although some will no longer use this
such as readybeluga
hatchboxpla
as well as my secure webhooks
like the one for translatebot
which doesn't work because im lazy, i procrastinate, and im disorganized
all at once
multitasking
oh god i just looked at mikey site kode
its better than the site
yuh
hey ppl
this good
sine it
Ramesh doesn't want to
but it is good
so sine it
my zoom client is dum
You're locked in a room with a friend... permanently. This means... forever. This is someone that you're close with or are attached to (this doesn't necessarily mean romantically interested, but that could count).

... The room isn't bad or anything. You'll get supplies, food, and stuff like that. Books, whatnot. You can even get a computer, but you can't access the internet on it. It's rather large and sufficient for two people. But there are no windows, and you'll never get to see the outside again with your own eyes.

But there is a way out. And there's a way out for your friend as well. 🔪👀

Kill your friend, live with the emotional pain, and you will get to see the world again. And vice versa. Or be trapped in the room forever.

Would you kill your friend?
sure
much kill
quality response
why
Could you stand seeing your friend in that pool of blood?
the lack of windows
You get a computer
^
oh
that windows
i hate closed spaces
Yeah I guess so
song
yes
yes
ima make an alarm clock with wifi
so it never loses the time
Wife
not wifi
wife-fi
LoRa
that is the name of Cy's wife
WIFe
its an element

Cy's WiFe is LoRa
*sigh
Context: some dude opened his laptop while in Iran  (visitng parents) and went to github
Github blocked his entire company
I had a chem lab 😔
I already broke mine
this is a really weird sentence
the French direct translation is
who says new year says resolutions, good resolutions
...
Makes sense
it does but its nothing like the indirect translation
who says new year says resolutions = it wouldn't be a new year without resolutions
Whoever
Maybe
uh
Ce ne serai pas un nouvel an sans résolutions, bonnes résolutions!
hi, resolution
hi-resolution
my name is cy
Hi resolution, im dad
im listening to electro swing
The playlist?
no
this song
this album
i like the first song
its one of my favorites
but im listening to the other songs
in the album
this one is really good
sounds like something out of cuphead
idk what that is
its an “80s” theme gamed
music and look wise
this is not 80s
electro swing
is like
its not the 80s
that was just a random year
but its similar
i suppose
these are some pretty calm ones
idk if theyre even swing
they go slower
swing is usually noticeably more than 120 bpm
Swings not based on speed
no its not
but
it plays a part
i can swing a thing at 70 but yea it wouldnt sound good
idk what exactly defines swing
off beat
instead of hitting 1 - 2 - 3 - 4
1 - 2 - - 3 - 4
or 1 — 2 3 4
um
im not totally sure what you mean
u know a metrenome
how it clicks
no i know music
but like
its adding slight "spaces"
where u dont adhere to the straight quarters
hold on a moment
but doesn't pop music do that too
yea
lot of music swings
but i think the "swing" style is more to do with other aspects
i dont know much about the genre entirely, but ive learned how to “swing” notes
wait
hold on
Rustacean?
Recording audio?
i wanted to share the first 1.5 seconds of this song
it didn't work
but i think i see what you mean there
DUM dum dum DUM DUUUUUM DUM
yea its kinda like that
i think what makes electro swing sound the way it does tho
is like
the combination
cause its jazzy
well that
but
combined with old record filters and electronic sound
which contrast
that
its also prob not in standard
Jazz is the most annoying genre to play
cause triples
there was this rhythm
that i had to try and figure out
for a piano arrangement i was making
hold on
this song
the bumbumbum in the background
at exactly 30 seconds
hmm
thats an intresting beat
this song uses that same beat
at the beginning
well a variation of it
i think theres a 4 beat pattern and an 8 beat pattern
thats different i would say
yea thats nothing too special
ikson uses the 8 beat i think
no that's the length
i know
eigths on one, quarters on the second
those are not eigths tho
they r probably 9ths
this is what i got when i finally got it
Yea sounds about right
kords are kool
kords are annoying
luckily i cant do cords
what are the 4 7 kords
in order
i no play piano
i think its major dominant minor and diminished
i dont know what those mean
i just bang something and make music
does Cy like cute girls
Ah
the people have disappeared
Haha
see
I just inquired about cy's sexuality
Hey, please listen to my Aroundsound recording of 'Evening Recording'. Click on the attachment to listen.
I aint downloading something as sketchy as that
its me playing Prince
aroundsound?
what happened to deezer
listen
listen
it has too many mistakes
that version
just cover them up
i have like 26 versions
and theyre all called "evening recording"
listen
I figured out how to solve this issue
but
im lazy
so im repeeating code
nice
or
watch this guy
at that time stamp
and be blown away
nvm
rust
wont let me repeat code
screw this
how tf am i supposed to do this wtf
this is so dumb
dont use rust
that is not an option
why
and it's not rust's fault
it's the
library's fault
for being designed poorly
wait
Think I’m gonna cry
Dont do it
Why
Why a surface with mac
Too late
Which one?
Please not Big Sur
Wdym
No
Catalina
Good
Catalina is better imo
I spent like 8 hours trying to do it the hard way to just use someone else’s efi
But worth it
Yes
hackintosh?
I have one
Yeah
I never bothered updating it
What r u on now
Arch Linux
I never actually used it as a main PC
it had 10.15 or something
Yes
Why you should learn Rust:

Elon Musk's son knows Rust
what you dont understand
is that
im about to
run silver benchmark
in a repl
actually nvm i couldnt install krome
i could only install firefox
haha its replit in replit in replit in replit
Cy uses discord
miraesori uses discord
as well
Yes
i wanna install a vpn server on a replit
Sigh
Does it have a public ip
um
i actually dont know
i dont think so
i think its docker
it has its own domain
ramesh
challenge
where is replit hosted
Idk
cool wallpaper
i might put that on my laptop
something about ppl being men and women
apple
i am a woman and i eat some apples
uhhhh
what
that is
a werid sentence
is the noun gendering correct
idk
why do u use an ifone
Do I
yes
you do
And why you think that
the font and shape of the message
hi
Hi
is
cy
okay because
of the font and shape of the message
what even is this
?
that one is actually good
how do you say it in arabic
idk
how do you
transcribe it
idk arabic
cy is updating his bot
get ready
ooh Yes
bot is loading
just wait
come on
its going through the queue
almost there
bots dont usually take long to load
bot is loading
bots dont usually take long to load
no it takes this long
because
telegram has to send it
every single message
and each one takes like 400ms
Aide-moi
Help me
since it was disconnected
No When I move my mouse to the upper left corner it was 1 in the morning in direct proportion to the net benefit they have on the people.
Were back on the bus together ok ima do i386 it sets a precedent you may need something stronger like a coin or metal plate.
Ich bin einen Frau und ich esse dan Apfel
I am a woman and I eat apples
huh
ha i guesses that
but what about
the grammatical
stuff
like
the
"einen" is that right
is the gender of the article right
idk german
but probably
is the inflection right
are you sure
no
But so how do i stop nextcloud and nginx from conflicting ? ... Where are you.
말해 주세요
Tell me please

testing it
I dont have it this marking period And it's out of stock Idk what happend to it i has many a thing to do.

су is an interesting person
just give up
I can agree
to not
say the weird things
why cant rust be like c++
and have an impl file
and a definition file
k i added that
су
are
Ha
су is yellow
ramesh is yellow
СУ is interesting
cу is interesting
*Cyghing yet?
*sigh
cу
Someone, likely Ramesh, has said something that will not be translated.
k problem mostly solved
i remember when i had to do this at the 4h fair
with calum
...
he kept
posting
obscene
and innapropriate
comments
about me
so
i had to implement something
that being said
c-y is yellow
c-y is yellow
but at least it has to look weird
its kode
just reading the rust docs
hck
im making a sticker set for this
Ossoff hasn't won yet
things can still change
really
democracie
that's how biden won
i dont like democracie
what do you like
autocracie?
no
technocracie
you need a government that is too complex to become partisan
you need a government which can act quickly
but correctly
in the long term
democracy lately is not government for the people
its government for half the people
isnt he a republican
mitch
oh is he talking about the election of 1776 now
Lmao
very funny
the protesters got into the capital i think
people are evacuating
security threats
interesting
cy is desperately trying to comprehend python
websockets
server
he cannot understand how what where who
what
yep
they breached the capital
its like a solid 5 lines of code
When cy tries to use venv
when cy uses windoze
use linux
it literally does not crash
i mean i have literally barely ever experienced a crash in my life
ive had it fail to boot
linux requires maintenance
ive had it have other issues but ive very very rarely had it panic
use arch
you have to be a professional to even install that
no
I can do it
and it doesn't run half the things I need to run
I can even do it
like
Its stupid simple
all of ms office
for example
The hardest is partitioning
I mean then
or fusion360
Ramesh this is ur expertise
the other problem like I said is that it requires maintenance
so I have to learn how to maintain it
it's not
and update things
that hard
and all that
literally
yay -Syu
is not
hard
to remember
but I have no clue what that does
ramesh can literally do school
its all this rather cryptic stuff
you have to look everything up
nothing just directly makes sense
sigh
once you use it
and its really easy to mess things up
for some time
you get used to it
ramesh can do school
since its so complicated
take 5 AP classes
and use linux
without faililng them
Ramesh spends his time on linux
as opposed to other things
he could spend his time on
like what
getting friends?
I have a few and I like them a lot
among other things
idk whenever I use linux
it breaks within a few days
of me trying to do stuff with it
then I dont know what to do
whether its the ui
yes
you should
read
or the software
how linux works
it's a book
i read it over the summer in 8th grade
was good
no
7th grade
im not reading a book on my operating system thank you
I read it
I literally am fine with linux
u havent read one?
i read one on mac lion or whatever its called
idk the thing is windows is fairly simple
so its not hard to fix when it breaks
and all the updates and management and stuff is all graphical
so I dont have to look things up
it is
every time I wanna do anything
graphical on linux too
it works fine for me
and it has miracast
and nearby share
idk I could use linux for development stuff
which actually brings me to the other thing it doesn't have
hibernate
on windows
I can hibernate
boot into linux
then
shut down linux
what does hibernate even do?
boot back into windows
and everything
is exactly
where
i left
it
^
it stores the state
of your system
huh
its like saving the state of a vm
but for an actual os
huh
so if i have 27 apps open
and im running servers
and i have work open
and things are happening
and i need to shut down my computer
or boot into linux for a moment
i can hibernate
and not loose the state of everything i was doing
and on my laptop
it means
that if i leave it closed for more than 3 hours
in sleep mode
it will go into hibernation
and use no power
to get practically infinite standby time
Ramesh is gonna be like
oh theres this experimental linux command you can run
that does almost that
therefore this is not an issue
tried searching storming
then
this happened
murka
so far only murka website uses nginx
i have looked at many websites
ok this is bad
i literally
did this without thinking
faire une erreur
CY
remember my computer bluescreened
can you please just install linux
thanks
no
yes
or else
instead
i will run my bot
on an actual always on server
^
once i have time to deal with ssl
cygh
but remember
linux
or else
i just bit my lip 3 times
good
in half an hour
thats because
this is sad
windows bsodded
linux
is what you need
last time i used linix
Linux
i forgot to update it
and then
Yes
that was it
use arch
i was done
then it wont do that
yes
use
arch
or if you cant
manjaro
that has an installer
then i have to reboot
every time
i wanna go to school
uh
why
fourth time my lip
a;sdlkfja;sdlkfj;alskdjfasd;lkfj
chewing gum
to run school apps
like ms office
and zoom
idk i gain less from linux as a desktop os than i loose
oh right
zoom sucks on linux
that's a zoom issue though
well regardless of who's issue it is
idk maybe you haven't seen the advantage it is
such as
it used to not
not having to deal with bsods
they are almost irrelevant
they happen very rarely
not having to use wsl
and i have never lost any data
wsl is totally fine
not having to deal with pirating software
?
getting better performance
finding software generally
since linux has nice software
i have more than I need already
thats free
I have a 5900X
Im cool right
i mean
its what you do with it that counts
my windows issues are not very many
windows works fine
or else
Ramesh clearly
likes
macos
why do you think this
he is not recommending akhil
switch to linix
no because akhil
doesnt
hate desktop linux
like you do
i dont
hate
anything
In fact
i just
dont feel like switching
Akhil wants to learn about Linux
without much of a purpose
i do too
learning experience
in servers
if you switch
you learn
and backend
boring
boring
linux desktop is just not really very
relevant
or useful
to me
thats what everyone says
but what do i gain?
"I would rather drop linux support than macos support"
i lose so much
like what
microsoft edge?
hibernation for example
miracast
what is hibernation again
ms office
btw linux has hibernation
its like saving the state of a vm
this is useless
but for ur os
i wrote a 135 page story in ms office
do you think i care
about
what
ms office
do you want
me to use
libreoffice
hell no
that is trash
literal trash
i tried it
you think so
when
it was trash 4 years ago
i refused to switch to linux because it didn't have ms office
also i use onedrive
then i switched to linux
theres an app for that
but u gotta pay
im not payin
its like
5 dollars
i use autohotkey
which im sure you have
for what
typing schwas?
ə
turning on and off my lights
ah
and dimming them
that can be done easily
without ahk
also
i think theres a linux ahk
clone
with what?
custom keyboard shortcuts
you are telling me
the settings application
can place http requests
yes
on keystrokes
you can tell it
to run scripts
that place http requests
on keystrokes
when you press keys
miracast
1 what is that
two google it
i bet it's there
miracast is wireless display
i dont use it as much now that i temporarily have a second monitor
but
here
havce fun
when i dont have that monitor
theres a miracast
no
the windows implementation
is the best
it also support input
it saved me so much hassle at drama club
like you do not understand
literally ive never heard of miracast
that's because you're a linux person
who writes on paper
and uses rust
so
that's insulting
no
its not
its just
it is
fight me
there are different ppl
doesnt mean
i happen to be of the type
you have to stay closed-minded about changing
who knows what miracast is
im not closed minded
i have tried linux
several times
as you know
and from driver glitches
to installing software
Yes
on your
to just installing anything
or booting
i have literally
never
encountered issues with linux
the problem with linux
is its like doing coding
if you use it enough
but to use your os
yes
you have to look everything up
do you like coding
yes but only when i have to
what if
instead of opening adobe
reader
and searching for buttons
i do
bam i have a joined pdf now
ok but whats to say i cant use pdftk in wsl
cuz that's the other thing
wsl is slow
i have wsl
no
i dont like wsl
its not
and it runs all the linux commands
so if i need to use linux
yeah ok
i open wsl
ok
fine
try that
i could just install firefox on windows
try running my hangman application
see how easy it is
almost all the graphical stuff is available for windows
to get it to work
bye
i have to do things
it is a nightmare
to compile things on windows
i dont have to deal with stuff on linux
i dont compile things
i literally tried linux since i was trying to compile an open source game engine
not often that is
i compile my rust code
i like not spending 10 hours making mysql work on windows
then use wsl
i didnt
have wsl
well i do
when i switched to linux
now im used to linux
so i dont really care
what you need to understand
is we have different needs
i hate windows adware
yes but you see
i still use windows
every day
i dont like windows
but i know it has some benefits
just like desktop linux can have benefits
i dont use linux
because
that you refuse to acknowledge
i never have to
because your "needs are different"
easier to compile stuff
yes
customization
running linux-only server stuff on your desktop
no
more than that
like what
but you'd have to use it
that i cant get
from wsl
the gui software is better
no
it is not
does windows explorer
have tabs
huh
wdym tabs
TABS
no but it actually lets me access directories
that the linix one doesnt
wdym
the other problem with linux
is like
hidden folders?
control h
there are too many ways to install things
Like
well say i wanna install certbot cloudflare plugin
pip3
apt
no
dont
snap
use pip3
git clone
dont use snap
use apt
but if i use pip3
and i forgot
then dont
that certbot was installed from apt
use pip3
ever
then
it breaks everything
for that stuff
if you learned about linux
you will eventually
know how to manage this stuff
but why learn linux
or not complain about it
and just solve it without thinking
how does it speed up my workflow
hmm
try
compiling
my game
and see how long it takes to set up your environment on windows
vs on linux
try
editing
or
my onenote
notebooks
sure
i will
give me one
with a pen
ill just do it online
i have a pen
also, I use xournal
it works
on the desktop linux is a bit more promising than on laptop
since there are less drivers
and touch
and stuff
works
i tried it
i was surprised
it actually is usable on ubuntu now
and not glitchy to hell
idk I just need access to my OneNote and word
and onedrive
those are neccesary
online
onlyoffice
xournal
xournal is some obscure thing
no
it's not
and it works horribly on windows
that doesn't real time sync
try it on linux
and in 20 years
ill still have it
since ill have backed up my precious hard drive
OneNote will be usable
since its popular
xournal
no it's not
literally
no one I know
No one I know
its a ms office app
uses OneNote
other than you
my math teacher
and all her friends
since she likes it so much
she told them all
Idk
im not one to promote vendor lock-in
I have to do my spanish homework and sleep
bye
idk its just better
bye
enjoy your linux
ima make websockets connect-four
enjoy copying me
im copying a lot of ppl actually
visvam from 4h reminded me of websockets
and you reminded me of the fun of real time games
and i was about to do my real time with mqtt
but then i was like
websockets are probably simpler and better
also i was gonna use them in a 3.js app
for real time interaction between users of the 3d environment
before you showed me your thing
but yea im copying you
why so long
idk
by the way
u wanna see copying
no
doing work
ramesh
is going to use a mac
for the next
10 days
he wants to see cy's response
cy literally doesn't care
if you use a mac
he does not really care which operating system you use
and he does not hate apple
could someone
open that page
k wait
you see 2 users
right
i mean yea
now 3
i see two connected users
yea
now close it
um
closed it
it worked
i see 2 now
but
hold on
meh
the kode runs
it produces ugly error messages
but apparently that's how its supposed to work
according to the documentation
does this mean apple developers are just incompetent and cant support things right?
um
idk the context
idk sure if other ppl come
akeel is coming
its at 2:30 rite
the server is down rn
i need to fix a bug
hey someone
Connection error please refresh
um
refresh
I win
hold on a moment
ok hold on
use chrome
i dont have wss set up yet
and safari requires wss
so does Samsung internet
aashhdahsdhahahhhh
error
errors
what do you see
error
please refresh
you were connected for a second
i think
um
its broken
i suppose i need wss
hold on
maybe cloudflare
can bail me out of having to do actual work
is fun
to have infinite turns
yes
oh wait i think i tried cloudflare wss proxying before
and it didn't work
time to get nginx involved
and certbot
i dont like certbot
its mainly a linux and python issue though
they keep breaking my certbot
clonezilla is now downloading
hola
did u guys go to rooms?
are u in komp sci
no not yet
almost
ill just join the room
k
im lazy to join the lounge
hi workspace 4
had to get off
i see
ima make konnekt 4 work
in case it wasnt clear
junk
Hola
it works sorta now
btw
you dont have to click toggle anymore
it just
leaves them on
under the blur
wait
lets play an actual game
ha i win
wdym
i won
actually idk now
NO
this game was RIGGED
i will march into your capital
to prove it
hh
ha i win
RIGGED
RIGGED I TELL U
opponent sanity lost
hang tight
if you rejoin
it saves
the state
rejoin
Cant
why
Am about to take a shower
ah
ok
Ill be back dont worry
ima text alankar
do u wanna play
no
not now
Yes
oh god
hey ramesh
1 game
l8r
fine
i will though
remind me like tomorrow night
if i dont
before that
and i will play
and if i dont use my words against me
itll be actually good tomorrow night
ill work on multihangman tomorrow night too
k
Game night
yes
Yes
3 player connect four?
Yes
Tic tac toe, four in a row!
the problem is i wrote my code for 2
thinking
who would ever
want 3 player
connect four
who has 2 friends
me
all available at once
i was gonna add more games tho
if someone does something embarassing
so more than 2 ppl can be on the server
and covers it up
and you realize they did something embrassing
would you point it out to them
Hell no
why
Like why
its a hard question
They probably know what they did
because like
what if it will answer a question
or is of
personal import
if you dont tell them
then they are wondering if you noticed
but
if you tell them
they might feel more embarrassed
sigh
ramesh is an idiot
okay
i would say dont
but
if you do
thats what I thought
reassure them
that its fine
what if it's really not
CySocialSupport
Hell no
sorry
that was too blunt
I'm not saying that you're not social
it's just like
details
yes
ramesh
no give details
Yes
U will be fine
Yes
the thing about a bad decision is
it's not really a bad decision ever
U cant take it back
if you learn to be a better person
from it
Or that
its looking good
cygh
it also isnt garbage
akhil might have seeen
what i would have said
here
I may have
but i didnt
it seems like a bad idea
I may not have
no bad
terrible
no
bad
what
ur not supposed to be allowed to do anything
why
is it leting you
Everyone is red
no
this happened earlier
hold on
when someone joins
and i have my red and yellow going
that person becomes red
then
when they leave
both mine become red
Haha
hi i write kode
That was a good title tho
yes
Obscure
no one got it
sadge
saying
"love is sad" is too cliché
imagine actually using lighthouse and getting 100% on seo so ppl actually see ur results
alright not bad
Ramesh scored higher than me
in performance and best practices
What does accessibility mean
how about
oh did they kill that
whats the best website you know
Nice one google
that's not 3.js
Idk
Yes
Ha
so
i like lighthouse
Çiðî
ramesh
lets play connect 4
no
later
akhil
lets play connect 4
later
aw
cy is confused
ah cy fixed his issue
Nice
Should i store username and password data in the keychain
Or a json
wdym
for what
I need to store URL, username and password data for logins
i can either store them in the os keychain
for a website?
cli
you wanna store all your passwords
im sorry i need more context
ok so im making a cli tool to allow remote turn on and of off servers
ahhhh
i need the servers ip, username and password to do so
i can either take the data and store it in the os keychain
or make a json and put it all in there
how are you doing that tho
do the servers have an api?
ssh
wait
so
u can send a command through ssh
you can ssh into the BMC
yea
atleast mine does
and so you need to store the ssh passwords
ok
um
keychain is secure
if the ssh is not exposed
to the world
i would say
dont worry
use json
k
and dont make the password anything that is used anywhere else
for anything important
wait
my server does that too
yea all servers with a fancy card thingy do it
well mine doesn't have a fancy card
its just its not linux
u need to use weird commands
i have SuperMicro IPMI
yea IPMI is a standard
but its bad
you have iDRAC
yea
tbh
i dont need to turn my server on or off
i just leave it on
alla time
i do
i turn on and off at times
it runs a website
so
reboot it and stuff
they are redesigning windows
i will finally get my rounded corners
now that Panos is in charge of windows
huh
i want
but i dont wanna update my mac
wdym u want
rounded corners
u hav rounded corners
well more round
no the windows ones are not gonna be hugely round
8px probably
macs is like 4
it barely looks rounded
but the main thing is like
actually u know what i want
they will use
consistent
design
what
see that fckin edge
ah
yes
strong words for strong edges
its garbage
i hate it
it looks awful
on windows i can enable or disable the edge
i can make it be my accent color
I wish
well i could
if windows was activated
which its not
spotify has a worse one
activate it
so im stuck with hot pink / orange
salmon
color
as my accent
in dark mode
with the edge disabled
which tbh is not too bad
yea doesnt sound bad
the thing is
should i do a fresh install of macos?
the only thing
with windows
is that
you cant change the personalization through settings
but
every other way works
and so
my lenovo
was in dark mode
and it synced over
after about a month
and backgrounds
can be changed from the photos app
i mean
how much
stuff do you have
also what does that solve
nothing
then why do it
i just wanna kinda clean the drive
and set up stuff
like vagrant and start using virtual env
oh god
no this is like
good
i dont let my drive go less than 50 gb
this is the largest my free space gets
the main reason being
i already did a mass exodus of stuff
that windows updates take up 20gb
huh
so im forced to free it
until the windows update is complete
then i go into settings
because
windows when you do a major update
it actually stores the previous version
so if you dont like or have compatibility issues with the new version
you can click one button
and go back
thats nice
but i have never needed to do that
when mac os updates the bridge also updates
so i go into settings
and its cancer to go back
and tell it to purge that old version
bridge?
idk what it is exactly
but it includes the T2 chip and the touchbar
to go back u can always restore a previous os version
but to make it work u need to also bring the bridge back one verison
i see
and to do that u need another mac with the os u r downgrading to
on windows theres no real other way to downgrade
than to use this
option
but
i think you can just find old os versions online
yea
or you could archive them yourself
this was actually a big thing when they wanted everybody to upgrade from windows 7 or 8 to windows 10
they were like
if you dont like it
you can just go back
anyway ill be waiting, Panos, for my file explorer that doesn't look and feel like trash
whats fun is i might actually get that
in a preview build
on my laptop
cuz i think its running the windows dev channel
huh
i want them
i need hdds
here
ill send you some
you can take em outta the screen
Gracias
can we get a pic of akhil wearing a sombrero
with some maracas
singing
"gracias"
Haha
I want to see this

wait out of curiosity
akhil put down a piece
akhil
i did
gimme a sec
watch it
Its not doing anything
no wait im trying to find the js function
Make it float or something
its red now
make em all red
akhil
open dev tools
I like
rust
ok but the web works on js
so
I hate js
also
you can write rust to work in runtime web
wasm
*sigh
now everyone is going to do this
?
?
akhil you didn't use the command
wasm
to make chips float
i tried
it no work
so i gave up
more like i couldnt find it
what
you open dev tools
go to console
paste it in
and replace r and c with row and column
gl in cybersecurity
hacking things
yes
see im lazy
ima make my own search page
so i can use google
without ads
idk how to really do it tho
sigh
i need to be able to parse html
did you know
ublock exists
yeah but it doesn't work on google search ads
it works for me
^
ublock origin
not
ublock
i have that
and
it doesnt
work
i mean
no search something more specific
with no card
like what
tell me
secure websockets nginx not working
"google pixel 5 screen protector"
hmm
now they dont show up for me
they are intermittent
but what happens is this
idk what you are using
so it loads the results
right
then
it waits
a second
then
shows the ads
in place of the results
so right when you're about to click
websockets are fast
i wanna do a speedtest
sigh
i did one in my house
but that is not representative
so ima use onnna u
but i needa make it work so hold on
hi someone open this
dont click the button yet
tell me once you have
actually yknow what just go for it
click the button
as a test
can you open my page
Not at my laptop
oh
Ill click when im back at my desk
when
idea
make a thing
that records windows on linux
like
i can press a button and it will select a window
and i can record an mp4/gif of it
and upload it to doggo
Huh
Intresting
Its not awfully hard
Its just auto window recording
it is hard
try it
can you open
my page
no
why
yes but it only takes a second
you open it
click the button
no
then
wait 10 seconds
ask someone else
then stop it
i asked akhil
he said no
désolé
i can now
send
im lazy to scroll up

nonononono
stop
refresh
ok....
k now wait one moment
click in 3
2
1
0
clicked
messages in 10 seconds
nice
including latency
bi-directional
so half were to me
half were to you
huh
which comes conveniently to 60fps
on a standard home internet
my phone on cellular got 45 fps
i spammed the button like 15-20 times
so
yeah it was not nice at first
here we do again
reload
and click
once
done
what
?
i pressed
hold on
that time everything failed
on my end
one more time
le pressed
yeah so what happens is it lags a little at the start
which is interesting
that time I got 56 fps
ch
akhil

i thought this was a linux problem
speshul user territory
sudo audio start
sudo is best command
sudo akhil
welp
guess i ran with admin
but what do i do now
How did u get linode for free
hello people
my name is cy
and i made another website
....
Cy
This
Is what is called an addiction
Please get help
From professionals
no now were in a different territory
not design
this is
websockets
well not yet
so you see
on your phone
go to
No no this is what they all say
U went back to this
U made another
Its an addiction
alright its an addiction
so is coffee
and America runs on it
so
what happens when you go to the site
do you get numberz
No
what do you get
I get undefined
open it in regular safari
I did
hmm
Pretty sure websites cant access my sensor data
Cause sekurity
no no there is a different issue
um
i mean heres the thing
first it wasnt working in chrome or Samsung internet
on my phone
until i enabled https on the site
so maybe
theres some other security check i have to do for safari
yeah so on safari
you have to ask the user for permission
gimme a sec
can you go to the website
and click the "make it work on ios" button
Yea it works
wait it does
that's good
now i can start streaming it
He has to do it slowly i think
hey ramesh
wbat
on your phone
and click make it work
hi is anyone there
*sigh
this would be a message

this would be a message
ws: connected
Null error
not iOS
undefined
yes
but
on your phone
b'cuz it needs sensor data
later
fine
i mean i already tested it
with samuel
i gotta reboot my linode
so my thing reads sensor data now
so now what to do with that...
i must go
bye
i will give you your sensor data soon
getting there
you keep complaining about certbot
that is wonderful
now
tell me
how
to get certbot's cloudflare plugin
to actually do
what it hkin says
in the docs
and read an api token
rather than asking me
for complete access to my account
even after i have installed all the right versions of everything
hi my name is cy
i spehl
why
do you use
cloudflare plugin
i want a wildcard
what if i actually need one
like not out of laziness
ok
uhm
you use the certbot dns plugin
not cloudflare right
um
i want it to auto update
ok fine imma try
see what happens
later
ok but listen
i gotta fix this program
its gonna ask you
for an email
and an api key
but that is insecure
and
they have added a more secure option
where you give it a token
to access only one domain and only parts of it
not you entire cloudflare account
that's what i wanna use
im not putting all my cloudflare access in there
ok fine
wait
haha
you cant
well maybe
if he syncs to goodreads
its honor precalc
kinda like google's Phone X
a mysteriously close iPhone X lookalike
I do
I always sync to goodreads
its a dual skreenshot
Oooooo
Cy uses Discord
he does
See i am sad
why
Ramesh doesn't even notice that he has 2 monitors now
Just that he uses Discord
Cause unlike yall my monitors r different sizes
mine is too
one of mine is 15 inches
mine were never different sizes
even when i didn't have that one
i used my laptop monitor
and it is 1080p
My laptop is 15, but my monitor is 27
heck
even my phone
Its annoying
is 1080p
no those are inches
Idk what i use it on
its pixels that matter
Laptop has fancy retina
Desktop has 1440p
apple screens are weird resolutions
Its downscaled
Its weird
im still trying to wrap my head around the storming of the capital
Hmm yes
its like
why tho
Idk
What did they expect
also
Trumps twitter got permanently banned
Yea
yes
yes
this
is
great
Hold on hold on
Some people will beg to differ
why
who
why
anti - cancel culturists?
however
i think that it better have been preserved
officially
Yea mabye
well
ik internet archive exists
or like
it even loads the video
show the old tweets
Yea i think it would have been better like this
after 3 minutes
but prevent him from continuing to tweet
from twitter's perspective
its like
no
we will not be a part of this
But there was a lot of other movements
Like BLM which was also bad
But they didnt ban accounts for it
the president of the united states
should not
Btw this is great dont get me wrong
be using twitter
to spread
fake news
Thats what i hate
and if i were twitter
fn from_domain(domain: String) {
        
    }
Heck even facebook banned him
i dont understand
ignore this
ok
only for like
till the end of presidency right
what i dont get is this
i still wanna hear what the pope has to say on this
I think
we have so many people in our country
half of them are republicans
conservatives
right-leaning
so why
become president
and not
one
of the many
sane
individuals
Cause he ran ig
who share similar views
people
america
He was lucky
is insane
idk
they thought he was «different»
Yea
Cause he was a so called
i dont like democracy
I think things will become better
the ppl are dumb
the ppl should only share
their ideals
and views
not
choose who the president is
and then the president in office
should be forced
to hold to those views
Hmmmmm
that way
we dont get ppl like trump
but also
issues that matter more to one side or the other
get handled
Well things should be better now
accordingly
Cause Trump radicalized the right
Trumpism
Once he gets out
and another thing
how did masks
become partisan
The right/gop should become better
how the f
did masks
become partisan
Ummm
Trump?
our country is divided
Didnt he downplay covid and not use a mask
yes
Then got covid
yes
Then started to use one
maybe
yknow in this country
there is no government figure to look up to
when we are unsure
Genius
haha
wait
Idk i like the speaker of the house
The old one
Pelosi?
Ryan i think it was
idk i cant trust anyone there
Nah i have respect for him
at that timestamp
That thumps up
Hes staring into my soul
QAnon
watch it
its so funny
That is a cult
Look it up
Its so stupid
no
watch this
Like wtf is this
white ppl
Yup
Conservative white people
I aint gonna call all white people like this
did you see the video
Im watching
With no audio tho
its like a short clip
no its all the audio
its his comment
its so funny
Ugh fine
I mean he isnt wrong
"you're not supposed to storm the capital unless you're prepared - at least wear some googles or some s"
That was good
Everyone was pissed at how they did it
Also did u know
what
The lack of wearing masks during the raid actually was a detriment
tbh
Everyones faces could be caught on camera
all we can hope for
is that those ppl
die
of covid
If they wore masks like they should have, the chances get reduced
bc they dont wear masks
Haha
Just wear a mask
How hard is it
The entire fcking world does it
*sigh
Not americans
i could complain
We have guns
we will fight
the coronavirus
WITH GUNS
For our FREEDOM
This was the cure all along
Those damn liberals
yes
We just needed our guns
*sigh
Welp
I can only hope bidens a decent prez
they wanna impeach him
my dad is like
flaming
he was saying curse words
with my brother nearby
Flaming trump or the congress?
at trump
like these are the words
he uses
Ah i think everyones parents were
when he is under this thing in our garage
and he stands up
and whacks his head
real hard
its like
Ah
cuz its too low
Put a pillow
Itll soften the blow
put a pillow on trump
He is a pillow
no
you may not use that
until you convince me
not to be lazy
and actually
get the server running
on a stable system
Do it
I mean if u want
it takes like 10 minutes
Its a tone indicator
idk tone indicators
Its like to protect urself from people on the internet
what does it mean
ah
I think
why is this a thing
i literally have autism
and i get it
So
Essentially
People cant take jokes
ah
So they need to be told its a joke
*shaking head
Smh my head
Its the most commonly used one
i dont talk on online forums
I sometimes
Le reddit is a good place
Every problem one has
Its prob on reddit
i should go to reddit
and see stuff
idk i just look at it from search results
when im like
why the fck my nginks aint werkin
hellllp me
Google is a great place
make ma nginks work
Have fun
no it works
right now
Imma learn blockchain
and i challenged ramesh
to figure out the cloudflare thing
What cloudflare thing
cuz hes so into linux
so essentially
Also can u not use cloudflare
if you wanna ssl a wildcard
Its harder to hack ur websites and stuff
then you have to use dns verification
and to automate that
there is a plugin
that will automatically update the .txt record in cloudflare
Huh
I don’t understand any of this
but it wasnt working correctly
its simple
in order to ensure
that you own the domain
letsencrypt gives you a verification key
then
their servers
well
first
you put that key in your dns of your domain
then
their servers check for it
if it matches
they assume you own the domain for the next 90 days
before you have to re do this process
Huh
Lets encrypt sounds nice
I should use it
well
only use it if you have to
otherwise
just use cloudflare
in flexible mode
I use cloudflare now
cloudflare also decreases the load on ur server
by 75%
Yea
I found our 1000 people have visited my website
In like 4 months
im actually at 59%
for this month
caching
Makes sense
U have way to many websites
U need professional help
Its not good
i wike websites
Itll feel good the first few times
Then everything will only be about websites
Ur life will go downhil
whats nice about web is this
Stay in school
everyone
can get to it
its not like
i have to compile for ur platform
and force you to open the cli
Okay well i make things i need
also web is just easy
Eh
It might be
it makes sense
I havent played with it enough
its simple
and that's what ppl are gonna see
like
when i wanna show ppl what i have done
i show them my websites
this is not electro swing
this song was released today
at least on spotify
u prob dont/wont like it
Ill listen to it tmrw
yknow a problem
all these qanon and white supremacists and whatever
they all look the same
and there are ppl who look like them
who are not qanon white supremacists
and so now there is implicit bias against these ppl
with good reason in most cases
but there are ppl like i said who are white with beards
and are not
white supremacists
i could name several teachers in our school
who look like those ppl
and now every time i see one of those white men with beards
i instinctively am reminded of this
interesting
how is this a thing
you responded
but did not read my last message
oh
migod
i need
an article
from the recent
storming of the capital
not from 1939
capitol
i was like
is this guy one of the rioters
and then i was like
no
hes wearing a mask
Ha
i am now doing the French thing
ik you asked me about it 5 hrs ago
Oui oui baguette
dégoûtant ne faire pas tes devoirs? smhhhhh
what is smh
ikn
what is ikn
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
>_<
what is ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
passive-aggressive shrugging
shaking my head
Repl
uses
google docs however
does not
replit and internet explorer make a great team
what is it with my phone and always being at 69 percent
when i look at it
Debate and Michael getting no sleep also makes a great team
yes
hence
why you are awake
to see cy's addiction to web design
that keeps him up
at this hour
im streaming gyro data from a phone
to a 3d representation
I want to do web design so badly
Oooo
on another computer
That is cool
using websockets
it is cool
I've wanted to do that with acclormotor
even my dad said so
Like external one
i wanna do it with phone
the idea is
And model rocket flights
you use your phone
as essentially
a wii remote
for something on ur pc
like a web game
Bruhhh
or presentation
or
Ping pong
yeah
something like that
actually that's a good idea
i might implement that
Yuh
but for now i need my spinney rectangle
which i dont have
Awww
cuz i need to add client registration
to my server
before i can do that
repl uses websockets
Ima go to bed cuz I finish debate work for tommrow
Bye
bye
ah yes
who wants a silicon child
"iphones are for leftist communist liberals"
we are americans
we buy samsung
we support america
by being domestic terrorists
*sigh
notice though
the categories of android people
its on YouTube now
what did I do wrong
i have literally no clue
it was like
a joke
using
a book quote
that no one will get
Are you sick and tired of Nitro subs flexing on you?
Ha ha
what do you think though
um
i mean
sure gimme an api key
okay
ill make one
k
um
now what
you um
then once you have cargo
run
k
idk if it works on windows
im like
99% sure it works
wait
uhm nah it works
um
make it werk
Yes
enter
Then it will ask for your api key
now do
emotes help
you should probably make a namespace
like emotes namespace create slug "Name of Namespace"
the slug is what you will use to access
so like
what
did you run
I love how you don't show the command
yes
that's not
how it works
it's
emotes namespace help
hi my name is cy
i do not use
You
cli tools
need
to
emotes namespace create cy "Cy's Namespace"
um
I don't rtfm
k now
how
do i upload
emotes emotes upload <namespace_slug> <emote_slug> emote_path
so like
emotes emotes upload cy <emote_slug> <emote_path>
hmm
also
plz
make
ur messages
mono
so i can copy them
wdym mono
with one click
like
ok
fine
ik
did you upload anything
ah
hi you know whats a thing
you know what is a thing
this is a thing
sigh
hey ramesh
can you go
to
on your phone
then click
make it work
yes
now
leave that open
and open
on your pc
ok cool
it is like
off
oh
that might be
a compass issue
idk
it start 90 deg off
which browser did you use
on the phone
firefox
yeah
so
i think
firefox and Samsung internet
start at 90 deg
whereas safari and chrome
start at 0
if you wanna fix it
just like
turn your phone
i will
90 deg to the left
counter clockwise
then
reload the page
and click the button
then turn it right side up
later
what should i do with this
Game
controller
yes that's what i was thinking
wii
ima make another website
hi my name is cy
wait
before i make this website
lemme see if someone already made it
meh
it exists
but only kinda
so its a YouTube player syncer
so essentially
ppl can watch all at once
and share
the same stream
so for example
instead of teachers streaming YouTube over zoom
they use this
so they can pause
change the time in the video
and
chat
using embedded nochat
all on one page
that syncs
to all other viewers
sorry
Cy
But HOW IS THIS CURSE WORDS
Like in caps
oh
Ah
You mean the users
can you send me the link
see
yes
um
I see
one
i
cannot
curse word
talk
no more
about this
with my parents
I understand
just
I'm just saying like
do not
I won't
send
anything
remotely
innapropriate
ever
See
again
I did not
look at the
user list
like for safety
just dont link to other discord servers
Okay then
i see
FPS: 0.17
this
is the problem
This is probably a remarkable piece of technology though
I'm not going to play it
but interesting
i see
*yawn
i wanna go to sleap
*yann
sleap then
sleap
i wanna
but
i have
2 ours
do it then
of ohmwork
cy has dimmed the lights
now he feels awaek
eye spel
Finally
MS edge has vertical tabs on linux
Ramesh has surviviorship bias from Linux
so i did an experiment
and i actually asked one of the teachers
for a web app idea
i asked Mr Y
and he told me
he wants an app
that can give him tracking data
on who when and how people watched/listened to his videos and audio
like audio of the students
no
or if they had audio on
Playposit
he makes videos
i told him
that
he said he has already started looking at it
but
but idrk
he sort of
dismissed it
in my conversation
he also told me this:
he told me
u should make an app that pairs with a small tile in ur pocket that sends tracking info to him
software for school has to be approved
by ppl
Of course
By the board
its useful for debate
why
xplane
deb8
Cause those buildings big
cuz track city
why tho
cuz he need track us wen in big city
And u get lost in them hella easily
this is an actual issue?
yea
cuz all of our rounds are miles apart
berry
num
num
yesssssssssssssss
Really?
berry num nums for all
berry num nums are like $150
yea, in some cases like at upen
they xpensive
Ah
yea but
I wanted to do debate
But im bad at it
noooo
And am lazy
wait
u be goo
LoRa
trust me
lora
dumb
for this
bc
Ill try next year
what if i made an app tho
ok
for fone
yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
that did trak
u hav experience from berrynumnum
alternatively tho
but the problem is
apple
you could just like
Yup
all have a telegram group
and share live location
that murder battery tho
true
but hardware is hard
literally
like send location at certon tics
hard-ware
like if u on the move it track live
U might as well just give tiles to students
what if i could reprogram those gps dog trackers
wait
with cellular
i just found something
what
yeah but
those dont have GPS
so
they are like
weird
they like
yea but they are good enough for a city
log where you last lost them
so like
if you walk away from them
go like more than 50 ft
like they have a 5 mile raidus and other ppl with the tile app make mesh
they lose signal
and relay info
and log
hold on
tile is big mesh network
yeah but its not reliable
but it cheeeepppppppppp
its mostly for finding lost things
that's cuz no gps
or cellular
yuh
Lost kids
they are expendable
no
thats what the police for
the thing is you could just solve that with telegram live locations
they dont hurt battery life that much
yuh
did you hear
no one wants whatsapp
cuz facebook
Yup
Mandatory data collection
they all gonna use signal or telegram
PWA ftw
ah eyeohesse
Huh he has 30%
you mean
telegram
has 30% of ppl
?
?
im lost
no i mean the commision
he has a 30% commision rate
what does that mean
that means any money he makes
30% goes to apple
ah
from the app ofc
yes
eyeohesse
eyeohesse is wonderful
yes
eyeohyesse
ima make mr y's app
that tracks video watch time
although
idk exactly how imma do it
probably with a flask app
also
since this is more relevant
I should learn
DBs
yes
i recommend Mongo
but u can learn any
"just store it all in a json"
how do dbs work
tsk tsk tsk
this
xplain
like an excel sheet
but bigger
better
i make
big
xcel sheets
well no
excel is for like one-2 people
well what i hear
is that
dbs
DB are more focused on lots of data
allow for simultaneous access
like thousands
and yea simultaneous access and its easier to filter
i see
so if i wanted to use mongo
for example
how would i do that
like
specifically
like what do you do
idk specifically
im learning how to use em rn
have you used dbs
i see
like a few times
but with example code
i see
ok
tbh i might start with mysql
that also works
since its more popular
LAMP
yea
im just learning mongo cause ive used it before
btw
the person who started mongo
i saw a presentation
by her
they started it
by asking lotsa ppl
what are you upset with
and they said oracle
i dont wanna pay oracle
thousands of dollers
or use krap
i want
good software
idk exactly her part
but ik she knows about how it came about
yea mongo is nice
my dads work uses mongo
is there any way to get all my telegram messages
wdym
yes
there is
how?
hence
yes but how
one moment
wait do i need telegram desktop
like the actual desktop app
i rekord my skrean
yes
eye spel
cy did you try emotes
moar
um
what do you want me to do
i thawt cy yousehs dıskawd
cy doesn't emote tho
:(
and he doesn't like discord
for regular chat
oh
is it bwoken now
no
eye cant spwel
yes
200%
not 💯
:200:
ramesh
what is the server written in
rust
?
?
Python
the server
oh python
flask?
jawmes contwibutwed
you should
um
make the things subdomains
so like
um
that might be not easy
idk how u wrote ur app
but
i did it
ok fine maybe
myself
yes
seems easy
also make an issue in the emotes repository
like
i have a flask server
that does this
no ik i can see
this
why
for what
ill forget
literally
say
ah
"make namespaces accessible via subdomains"
k
what is wsgi
idk some like
protocol
for like making web servers
i see
im making a function called disconnect
and i randomly
randomly
heard the windows xp disconnect sound
Ah
This is very ironic
How convenient
Sigh
Yes
Now we are forced to put this into discord
see
ramesh doesn't care much for "data science"
Make a rust thing to do it for u
Data science is cool
I think shile ding
is pronounced shr luh ding
um
so i guess i learned mongo
signal
does not horrible
anymore
does not horrible
does not horrible
does not
horrible
that is correct
also elon recommended it
which is funny
time to install it
haha what is elon doing
that requires signal
why doesnt he just buy signal
ikr
like its pocket change for him
why is signal blowing up all of a sudden?
ah
well we stickin with telegram or moving to signal?
good
i like
not having
to use an electron app
signal is slow
i just sent Ramesh a message
no it's not
no deleting cy
there
i have
one
contact
what is this
no i dont like signal
we use tewegwam
im just seeing
im not gonna actually use it
i just saw
i must see too
yes
cygh
the magnificent crown
ah france
My house rn
ah
constructoin
we had that
for a year
i say no to AWS
why u making a cluster?
tbh idk why they even let you choose
just like
gimme the best one
idk cuz thats what you do
they host 500MB of databases for free
oh nice
i would just host locally
i mean i would too
but like
frankly
if i could get the whole thing hosted in the cloud
for free
that would be nice
like
use cloudflare pages for the static stuff
pythonanywhere for the backend
and mongo atlas for the db
freenom for the domain
a whole web app
all free
it would require putting a lot of the code client-side
since i refuse for the domain of my app
so like
js in the page
would have to load everything
and read all the pathargs
and everything
and then fetch the content from the server
and the db
which is not what i was intending
i was intending
for a flask server
to just do it all
ramesh is
typing from nomachine
in another room
and can switch between monitors
what is nomachine again
remote desktop
ah
ramesh is downloading roms with JDownloader
roms
yay
roms
for what
My brother
to enable him
to play games
k
hi im using MongoDB
hi im using postgres
imma use postgres from now onwards
bye bye mysql
hi idk what that is
readybeluga
readybeluga
uses
a
json
file
……
the thing is
i thought for ready u atleast used a db
no
to be fair
the json file works
you didn't notice
but
the json file needs to go
that being said
it has to be fast
so
um
i cant really afford to be asking mongodb for data every time
or can i?
idk how this works
wdym?
its the same as what u r doing with a json
i have to go the cloud
i have to place requests
with readybeluga
i just
have a dictionary
in ram
and i store it to json
for non-volatility
idk i think itll be the same speed
it might be slower by a bit
meh for now ill leave readybeluga as-is
its just for like
my project for the YouTube thing
will not use a json
it will use
like
mongoDB
idk if i told u
i have never
ever
used a db before
Yes
good progress bar
i need animation ideas people
something simple
but intresting
um
windows xp screensaver
No it has to have a story
i wanted to do that
that has a story
but its way to easy
?
um
im curios
Ramesh's story
continue
no i will not continue
dang
any other ideas
this
things I could animate
which one?
red is blue
thats a bit to hard
idk im not good at ideas
I could animate it
its just that the animation would be very bad
I was thinking I could make a Henry Stickman animation
cause i can copy his character models
but add a twist
then do that
idk what that is
some of the best flash games ever
It's sad cuz flash go bye bye
so you can reload
and it will remember your name
i got it on December 31
so
12 days
for 60%
on a factory charge
Uh what?
I get a month
im telling you
And a half sometimes
factory charge matters
factory charge
is not good
Always charge to 100%
Whenever u get something
yeah i didn't charge it at all
i like
turned it on
and used it
U should expect like a month with constant use
A year and a half idle
k
Dont ask how ik this
i should charge it
Do it
unlike the appow maus
Luckily urs has usb c
you can
like
charge it
and use it
Ik
at the same time
I do it sometimes
Ill just usually let it sit and charge
i have a usb pd charger at my desk
which i use for everything
like my laptop charger
which i use for fone
and laptop
Oooo
and all the usb c stuff
even the pi
I need to start switching to usb c
Lots of my things vary heavily
Ooo they made the charger look nicer
INSERTION
no thats not the one in the box
thats my pd charger
Ah
the one in the box is nice tho
Yea
Also holy cow that scroll wheel is shiny
Nicer than mine
thats a wonderful box
to have placed
right
under
your service
on wikipedia
Ah
aws was like
hell no
gtfo
and now i doubt anyone will want to host them
Nope
solution:
dont be an anti-Semite
Its also the easiest solution
well you'd be surprised
what it takes
to convince ppl
maybe having their service shut down by amazon will convince them
Well they sued
how are they supposed to get anything from suing amazon
who
So it might take more
in their right mind
Idk
would sue amazon
Apparently its a breach in contract or something
actually theres one other solution for parler
They aint gonna get anything tho
techmikeny
but even at that
Haha
with the publicity
they have gotten
and because
this
is on their Wikipedia page
no one
They dont really have a chance to get back
i doubt even hardware providers
Amazon has a nice legal team
a nice one
Very nice one
yes
i mean
maybe
some like
extremist
far right
Welp goodbye to parler
hosting provider
So nobody
yeah
What was parler even?
a social network
for anti-semites
and far right extremists
and anti-femenists
Cough
*cough
*Claps all around
Good job people
it was launched 2 years ago
Damn that kinda sucks
It was a new service
Then got yeeted into oblivion
Doesnt exist
wait
so that means
i could use them
as localhost
Dont
Yes
Do it
I change my mind
Just that picture
That resolution as well
its like
Use this picture
complete aws training
As this
apis for beginners
build your first app with swiftui
BEEF TAMALES
BEEF TAMALES
Hahaha
Youtube is great
i made a db in mongo
and now
i cant rename it
and as a result i am sad
Make a new account
And make a new db
i want
my data
cuz lets say
it was all already there
and then i wanted to rename it
Ah
There should be something to change it
Look it up on le google
i did
this is a tomorrow problem
what do you think of this
reload it
and it saves your name
but what about the design
Its not bad
i see
I like the play pos it look better
i mean thats a material design
But that may be because ive been using it for a while
ima make some PlayTools
which i giv to teacher
playtools will be based on a YouTube frame
and WebSockets
Disable the ability to fast forward
well essentially
what it will do
is report metrics
on time spent on site
and time spent with video playing
Ig thats fine
he just wants to know who actually went there
and how long they stayed there for
cuz rn he has YouTube analytics
but they are anonymous
how do you go home on numworks
like
the beginning of a line
no
you dont
this is mac-level garbage
this calculator
feels like a mac
in a lot of ways
except you can flash roms on it
yes
that is the notable
and gigantic difference
also like
in the python editor
theres no shortcut for comment
the hell is it with my phone and 69%

weird
except like
What do u need to go to the beginning of a line for?
If its python just make the programs on ur comp and import them
Other than that holding left gets to the beginning pretty fast
not if the line
is inordinately long

If our lives are like trees, society is the one that plants us, in a fixed place. It is up to us to grow, to the north, the south, the east or the west, in order to get out of the shade and find the sunlight we so desire.
No i have not
I voted for Donald Trump
The Steal is Real
I do not like how Twitter is ending the first amendment
I will not see Sleepy Joe's face
*Shooooook

Free north
Slave-owning south
Bring that back
Democratic north

akhil
Perfect

Works like a charm
U were saying
i was saying
idk
i wanna make a new government
where ppl vote on ideals
not on ppl
akhil
Si
sí
Then where is it?
its sort of
not anywhere really
but
now you are asking for clues
Huh?
that dont give things away
its not on the site
or on any site
but
you can find it
its the smallest little thing
Lemme load it
ima tell you what it is
No wait
Alright say it
Couldnt find anything in inspext
no so its in the inspect
so yknow how it says
this
at the bottom
yea
nice
dont ask me
why
i look at the http response headers
for all websites
but its kinda funny
that like
there was someone
setting up their site
and they like
added a response header
for that
Some people need to have a little fun while doing web dev
yes
fixed the game win thing
where it like
flickered
Oooh

*cygh
although its an x1
when is it releasing
"M1"
its tri-heterogeneous
it has 1 x1
3 a78
and 4 a53
means what
arm something
it means
it has 3 types of cores
in one chip
the x1 is the new one
its the so called "prime core"
so what i hope
is that we see chip designs with more of these "prime cores"
implemented for laptops and desktops
I hope we see more x86 laptops
no
x86 is done
it has completed
So is Akhil's precalc quiz
He has completed
ARM is bad
why
since it is more locked down
no
its not locked down
and proprietary
unless people make it locked down
Yes
and they do that
is the raspberry pi locked down
yes
how
but not that much
the problem is
android stuff
is extremely locked down
ok but thats in phones
can you boot linux on your phone
this is in pcs
can you boot linux on your desktop
not on my lenovo
not your laptop
and you can
disable
secure
boot
even if i disable it
most linuxes dont work
idk what you're doing wrong
but it should work
I have had like
no issue booting linux on computers
sorry
once people start making good arm laptops
we will see
I wanna make my own arch
also RISC V may become a thing
haha no
no architecture
for u
Yes
RISC V is sloe
RISC V may be interesting
guess who else may be interesting

this
like 99% sure
thats a lot of people
why
Yes.
like
a lot
america is screwed
why do u sympthaize
because
america
is dumb
at least 2/3 are a bit better than the rest
yes
but like
still
⅓ of america believes that it's okay to invade a government building since they didn't get what they want
yea is a lot
i cant believe
they forgot their guns
Bruh
they call it a revolution
where was the guns
they had guns
i think
one guy did right
the scary part is that
the police
doesnt
care
cause he straight up murdered someone
and the
like
the intelligence doesnt care
nor do like most republicans
they supposedly didnt stop them from coming in
they got in surprisingly easy
Exactly
it's like
they didn't care
and supported
a bunch of insurrectionists
^ and let them kill someone
Yeah
and the rest of the people didnt care
and another police officer there
killed himself
after
is sad
exactly
the US
is going to get worse since this will not just disappear
and it still feels like people are not taking this seriously
only time can tell now

don't you just LOVE stereotypes
Not business

this is actually cool
but

time to buy one
read the entire post
now Ramesh likes arm
Nope
Akhil
Its called project sandbox
do you have an iphone 7?
Nope
I wanted to do it
I have a 4
this is Very Cool imo
Not a 7
The team behind it is crazy
Its such a cool project
Technically it works on all of them
i mean
But a lot of them dont have support
Like screen or stuff
the thing is
iphones
have like
no ram
Perfect for linux
not a server
how do some phones not have cpu support
but have like
Yeah
I agree
support for other things
I'm not sure what this means
Idk
But its a cool project
I want a 7
But i dont have one
I uh
lemme ask
if they'd give us theirs for a low cost
Wait cy while ur there check of ios 14 a11 jailbreak is available
I need me a jailbreak
But i cant downgrade back to ios 13
idk that's the project sandcastle website
Yea checkrain should also be there
Like a link
um
no
I dont see it
Ah nvm then
Ill go and check
Wait its there
Except i have to disable a passcode
Damn
disable the passcode then
No SEP services
what is SEP
The fancy security chip
Aka no Face Id, passcode apple pay
Secure Enclave Protection?
Health
Yup
i see
maybe
get an android phone
I will
like pavel durov says
I shall
he says
iPhone bad
I wanna get a pickle
Or a fold 2
i wanna get a cucumber
Fold 2 would be cool
it would
hi im akhil
i want $2K
But its also the price of two phones
Who wouldn’t
I would trade my mac
Except i cant
And wont
*to buy a folding phone
With DeX support i think
So technically its also a computer
$400
Whats the new one thats coming out
Doesnt have dex but is cool
wdym
they all have dex
Nope
Fold doesnt
Austin tried it
And it didnt support/have it
i mean
they might send an update
why do you want dex tho
Idk
Im just saying
replace the rear glass
and its mostly ok
$380
and then
get at&t
since it's locked
yes
samsung website
is a scam
Wtf is this
I got excited
Then saw with a trade in
what phone was that
they giv lotta money for trade ins
Lemme check
Their website is super bad on mobile
Its really slow/hard to click stuff
With an iphone 11 its 650
U have to trade in a flip
To get a flip
At 99$
googll give you
$200
hahha
Nice
Samsung does $170
I dont wanna trade my x in tho
it's actually a good phone tho
The oneplus 6?
I mean its oneplus
They make decent phones
Yes
Get a pixel tho
please
do not
buy
a samsung
I want to
for your first android
So bad
you will hate android
2nd
and wish that you bought an iphone
2nd android
i tutchd the pixel in store
1st android after being a fanboi
it was nice
but
There u go
what else did you tutch
Is smooooth
it only as 128gb
可爱的女？
Thats double what i have
and that is not enough
for m
e
i have 128
seems fine
Idk i thinks its enough
i have 128
+ an SD card
Kinda sad they no longer have free google photos
But eh
my 128gb is 98% full
and my 128gb sd card is 75% full
i need storidge
and google doesn't giv it to me
porridge storridge
ah yes

my mom wants to spend $30K on a lab computer
yes
I want to spend 30k
on
ok nvm
see what im trying to understand
can it run crysis?
is
like
nice one
should she just use like Google Cloud
idk
No
they r special i think
why
Physical > Cloud
why
Because
you
own
the
hardware
^
but its $30k
so
google cloud would be cheaper
since this is not like a server
how much
but its a lab computer
which has to run all the time
yes
then
just buy a server
so you can stop it
it is easier to set up anyway
and not pay
so like if you only need it for 10 hours a week
ok fine but that's boring
just find out
which costs less as a whole
for however long
and then choose that if you wanna be practical
personally I would get the server though
the thing is the purchased one i think they said would be 4 years
before obselete
tbh
idrk what they are doing
cuz they also have a cluster
they have like Rutgers cluster computing services
so you can get essentially google cloud
but on premises
at rutgers
ooh
ok i like that
the main issue she is having
is she wants money
and they want to know
to the dollar
how much money she will need
next year
so like
you tell me
i mean
how much the dollar will decrease in value next year
uh
and how much that will change the price of a $300k microscope
id say a whole 10 cents
it is not really a bad song
thats why u always add extra money
u add emergency funds
ima eat dinner
bye
cya
ima record my spanish video
ah thats always a pain
gl
oooh
done
im🍑ment
take 2️⃣
J'aime pain
I like pain
i do like pain
it tastes gud
Yeah
i like buttered pain
im not sure my opinions on butter
but pain
pain is good
le pain
the contrapositive to that in English is like
i like the pain
when you mean to say
i like pain
yes
i dunno i mean if i were a well meaning republican
i would not want
this person
anywhere near me
hes bad for the party
its like
yeah
even
mitch
might consider impeachment
and thinks what trump did is impeachable
i dont advocate for terrible electron ui's being used as default programs in windows
even though i like windows
btw telegram uses more ram than discord
just saying
Ah
Prekalk
no
no i already did the practice
jeohmeatree
no discord uses more ram than unigram
"Akash M" is taking up 12mb of ram
how dare he
this is
I have to add
so maybe nvm
I saw telegram at like
800 mb
at some point
telegram takes up more
Yea
but telegram
on telegram
i can send videos
yes
look i dont like discord
on discord
im just sayin
i cannot
if im downstairs
is a long list
working with servers
and i need to send a video
to someone
im not gonna go and like
record
then upload to doggo
and get it all working
it takes like
all on my phone
and then
send it
not long
doggo takes like 5 seconds
ok but i have to log in
in the web portal
then go through the crap android file selector
just log in once
on my phone
Oh
when i take a video
Share via KDE connect
its on my phone
send
*sigh
how did u get it in the thingy?
do i have to build as executable?
wdym
that's woof2
not howl
doggo is faster than telegram
that's for sure
This is how
note the doggoninja.desktop
Ah i see
I have to figure out how to get it on le mac
or
install
winux
lol
this is pointless
what is this
riveting
is pence gonna do it?
Nope
besides I'm not sure if a 25th is good
i mean i dont see how he would
we want to prevent mister trump from holding office again
which means
im peach
but 25th amendment doesn't do that
you need to convict
and remove
and decide
not to let him go again
which is unlikely to happen
yes

i am doing my French homework
and then my math homework
Mjagjaxa çîsaş
the democrats are 12% less tech oriented
either that or they're actually thinking about their decision
the thing in the middle
is a man
This is a very interesting image
i would ask where you got it
but i willnt'
But you won't
wait so this vote
what does it mean
if one gets more than 50% they do that?
no
xi jinping does not tiktok
does he actually
that looks like a  meme
its a puppet
ah
cringe
no it funnee
"show ur retina on the camera lense"
lens
ima be studyin death penalty
i was like
china
and my group members were like
no
you can leave
I hav debate prep on that
were not gonna talk about china
they like
kill ppl
regularly
should we ban tiktok then
no
we should
give tiktok
to a us company
i support that
what about
keeping it
like it is
no
and unbanning huawei
china
is
a threat
to the us
so
and its citizens
free market
economy
is a thing
so is privacy and data laws
ppl dont care about their data rn
so is the CIA asking Microsoft for yer data
but once they do
they will realize that US companies
they will not want it in china
are a bigger threat
to the average citizen of the US
than chinese companies
listen
would you rather have china have a record of the lives of americans
by name
or the US
where we have laws
and the people can say
what happens to their data
what are they going to benefit from
having
a list
of
americans
and their lives
look
Chinese law does not apply to the US
real time info on anyone they want to attack
China cannot walk into your house and steal yer stuff
Yes but as an average citizen
am I gonna get attacked
highly valueable user data
that they could use against us
by tracking us
control over our elections
through use of their platform
cool
to promote
their ideas
then don't be stupid
I really fail to see
how
and spread conspiracies
using a
huawei phone
will spread conspiracies
if I am not using
this is tiktok we're talking about
chinese software
well
please provide evidence they are doing that
And I will believe you
Huawei just needs to stop because they steal
my dad tells me all the time
he tells me
how the chinese
steal
wholesale
everything
all our IP
they steal it
and they oughta pay
it's a tricky issue
my dad is the most anti-trump person
except
when it comes to china
I mean
Biden is also a china hardliner
he supports trump
when it comes to china
this is like
a bipartisan thing now
you know
i mean
that's my stance
regardless of the partisanness
Chinese software cannot be a thing in the US
until china follows data rules
and it is clear to consumers what china might do to their data
and china should not be able to sell cutting-edge hardware
ah
because its all stolen
from us
is it all
and from others
most of it
if it were stolen why has germany
is stolen
not banned china
because germany
is not the one
making 5G
they are not the leaders in telecom
or silicon
shrug
i have watched videos
where startups
talk about
how
they made something
and then
the chinese
came
and stole it
and then?
and they were done
no one bought their thing
give an example
there are two examples
i dont remember them clearly
but
one was this light up book lamp
or something
and the other was some sort of cylindrical thing
i literally dont remember anything else
about it
but i think about making a startup
and if i do
i dont want china stealing my ip
then
start your company in china
hell no
why not
im not giving my data to the Chinese government
and why
and risking my employees being killed
by the government
secretly
how much
does that happen
if i dont do what they say
Please give examples
I am uninformed
Of such nasty things
no one knows
all they know
is that
china
kills people
with no reason
other than that they dont like them
other countries have a tendency to do that too
why dont we just ban them all
china is notorious
google does not exist in china
so
baidu barely exists in the US
huawei is banned in the US
because they chose not to give their data to the government
bing
went the other way
well
the way you could see it is
the Chinese are forcing apple
to put their icloud servers
they are complying with regulations
in china
for Chinese users
and we
you really think
should be forcing
china would be powerful
chinese companies
if they were less protectionist
to put their data
in the US
japan was rather protectionist too to boost their economy
china
needs
to play
by the rules
illegal
immigrants
need
to play
by the rules
wdym
and not cross the border illegally
they should
wait
in line
look im not informed on illegal immigrants
so i dont really have a stance
but
when it comes to china
and trade
look I don't really think that china needs to have such a hardline stance
censuring and sanctioning china is going to punish normal citizens
who dont really care about geopolitics
and rather care about advancing their own lives
no
i am not talking about people
who steal ip
because
im sure it exists
the government in china
is the problem
china steals what we have
and sells it back
to our mindless consumers
this is not a fair trade
and it needs to stop
so plenty of companies do that in the US too
in the us we have regulation
Ha
tell that to Google and Apple
in the US we consider amazon "a problem"
And Microsoft
and Amazon
because they are like
anti-competitive or something
They are
imagine amazon just unlocked all the data in all their servers
and read it all
and made their own version
of everything
for half price
It's not as if china is doing nothing about this
let me provide an example
because they employ underpaid workers
Ah well
I heard a case
where china like
ruled that car companies were copying too much
and like did something about it
so did the US when it was industrializing
when it was industrializing
we have moved past that now
it was corrupt
and bad
and people were mistreated
and big companies abused their power
yes
that's right
now compare
china
to industrializing us
but guess what
we have grown up
and we dont do that anymore
and china
we don't
oughta grow up
sanctions
are dumb
have they ever
ever been effective
it doesn't matter if they're effective
the reality is
American data
is ending up in china
and
american technology
is being stolen by china
thus we ban huawei
so if anyone works for huawei here
they can go to hell
and get fired
my dad's company sells to huawei
they are one of the main customers
but even with that
look at his stance
That is his stance
his stance
is anti-china
Look
Idk
tbh what we need to do
is inform americans
that using tiktok results
in all their data
being in china
I now stand in the 0% of americans who think our foreign policy is too harsh
and then inform them
what china does
does it though
is it stored in china
yes
it is
show me
please
i forgot
but even if its not
i want to see where it says that
the chinese
still have full access to it
the government
so if the people
we the people
wanna keep our tiktok
force the chinese to sell it to a US company
look
im tired
of talking about this
k
ill just
ill stop
go somewhere else
where
geopolitics is not important
null island
and the country doesn't set interntational precedents
i like
neutrality
yes i do too
i do not
want
to take a stance
on anything like this
even if it's good or bad
i take stances
or i dont
it depends
its just that like
i might wanna make a startup company
and i dont want my company crushed
by the chinese
yes uhm
i dont wanna have to know what that feels like
you should
look at the ratio
of
crushed startups
to non crushed startups
hardware startups
ima watch that debate
bye

After

Why privately?
not time yet to say it out loud
are they impeaching him or not

Uhm

even if they didn't
what is it
Yup
lemme give you the entire school one
Emails was sent out

Why is there a Republican representative who is Russian
America
During an impeachment proceeding, a Democrat from Wisconsin says
"Let's unite and get 2000 dollar stimulus checks to everyone. Let's unite and solve this pandemic. "

I'm sure these are issues, but I'm also sure that they're not exactly relevant to the impeachment proceedings.
Cy is typing
id1 is recognized
id1 reserves
id1 yields to id2
The gentleman from Ohio is recognized.
id2 reserves
"Mr. Speaker, I reserve."
id2 is recognized
Reserve is actually smart though
Because he can kill the other side's time
id2 line busy
id2 releases busy
So he can hear their arguments and easily counter them
id2 yields back
its like theyre on an mqtt
passing around jsons
Haha
True
bam
bam
bam
3 republicans
3 more than last time
also there are 7
it's not done yet
i like how we're actually watching this
are you too
is anyone else in this chat watching
probably
not
nope
what stream are you watching
cspan
isnt that the left one
isnt cspan the government one
yes
cspan
is the government one
yup its the best one to watch on
85-80
they all have stenographers
you can turn on cc
up to four republicans
yes
my question is this tho
how are they gonna get through the senate
we shall see
if that requires 2/3ds
idk
they might
they might not
what are the chances tho
depends
id say like 40%
i see
ah good ol Mr.Buchanan
Haha
James Buchanan
buchanan
Tom Buchanan
Daisy's wife
srry i have the great Gatsby on the brain
thats why i said it
sorry i have apush in my mind
whats resolution 8?
Impeachment, probably
wait
no
idk
nope
im putting the stenographer against google live transcribe
the steno is much slower
Its allegdely a Bipartisan Backgrounds Checks Act
but google is much less accurate
133-132
133-133
134-133
134-134
134-134
135-137
137-138
140-139
wait theres a time remaining
yea
30 seconds
142-141
vote by means of ewektwonik device
145-142
146-145
wait theres no time left
how does this work
meh
they keep going
im pretty sure that's what happened yesterday
pretty sure all of em have to vote
i need 2 more things
i need things
i dont understand exactly what you need
messgaes
i essentially need themes
add a feature where u can see which ones u have seen before
make it like achievements
so like
ppl are inclined
to click more
to keep refreshing
and add slight odds
how do i store who they are tho
DB
no like
srry
identify
who they are
ehh use a cookie
but then they can lose their progress
i think thats fine
no ones gonna play this hardcore
make the cookie expire in like 3 years
well it would be localstorage
which i think is different from cookies
idk much bout cookies
i could add some js to the site and just make it have a number in the bottom
in really light grey
That would work
9 repubs
And they can get their progress with that code
my my
Yes
We r getting somewhere
Whats the vote
I stopped watching
Impeached
passed
Nice
done
added
i find it funny that it runs faster
over the internet
than to my local machine
idk why that is
1/10 of the way there
2/10 of the way there
5 trillion em
3/10
ah yes
wdym
5 trillion em
gigantic font
ah
1/2 way there
ah cy
did i break it
no
i just restarted it
Why
to make it even lighter
it was too dark
Im gonna lose this progress
no
i didnt
lets goi
its called localstorage for a reason
im in a incognito so i thought it would vanish
it will
if you close
and reopen
the camera literally just dies like 2/3 way through
hi my name is cy
i hit refresh
how many times tho
pleb
refreshed 1000 times
my finger is dying
but its worth it
1/10th of the way to the goal
My wifis bad
It takes like 2 seconds to refresh
use chrome
?????
it does better caching
In a minute
mine refreshes literally instantly
All my progress will be gone
true
unless you cheat
lemme try edge
and use dev tools
that should work
No cheating here
nope its still slow
welp im not gonna try
my fingers r dead
literally
over the internet
now if you would excuse me
i have to advertise a textbook
as a resistance implement
for PE
ah i am as well
idk how
just like
literally
it doenst matter
ima go do mine bye
my video is funny
i would send it
but
cy how do u do google live translate
u know for videos
that dont have subtitles
um
live transcribe?
or live translate
sure
i mean
Yall going back to school 3rd mp?
Im in school tmrw
How about you
Idk
Im prob gonna stay home
K
Cause lifes easier
I'ma eat dinner
And i can le cheat on all tests
Have fun
please make a record
Cy its an addiction
I did
Like H or smthing
ah yes
Get help
this is a test of the functionality of mongoDB
I beg u
This is going too far
why
U have way to many websites
Downsize
U dont need this many
more is more
But less is more
this is about half
Oh god
so simply put
it works
Nice
But its only 500mb
ok but like
1.
i can make more than one db
for free
and 2
i dont need that much
How much did this take up?
for like
wdym
it takes up as much as you put in
Yea how much have u used
so right now probably like <1 kb
Not bad
well cuz the only thing it has
is lorem
Still
It should store a decent bit
I wanna have a rpi tracking the weather
And have it store everything in db
actually nvm
more like 39KB
but most of that's probably overhead
like per-db overhead
not per-record
Huh
I should learn blockchain as well
this atlas thing is almost a dream come true
completely free
forever
and it has all i need
Yea
Imma use my server tho
and its reliable
Cause why not
reliability
is why not
i wanna make reliable stuff
so i need a reliable db
I prefer physical
Cause i can do whatever u want with it
yes
but i see it this way
if the free
Like give it more storage or ram
almost 100% reliable
offsite option
works
then
its better
although i will likely set up some onsite db for other things
like actual data storage
yup
servers r nice
like for example
my dad
wants a log
of everything
in his lab
at work
starting with temp and humidity
to light levels
and the state of instruments
to the temperature in freezers
he wants it all
and i might set that up at some point
at which point i would need somewhere to store the data
and that could add up fast
yea once u start doing that u need storage
thats gonna take up real fast
but for something like PlayTools
i really only need a db to store like
session ids
video ids
user ids
and user logs
that's it
and judging by how many ppl actually use my services
there wont be much of that
but
if i want teacher to use it
it has to be reliable
and not fail
unlike kami
which gives us
extra days
to study for tests
thats good tho
ima show my db thing to my dad
wait
yeah ok it sorta works on mobile
I wanna know
Is there anyway i can have a credit card run a command
Or some sort of card
Run a command
um
wdym
on your laptop?
how is your laptop supposed to read a card
No no
Im trying to make a general use ledger system
um
hang tight a moment
ill be right back
But i need some way to take credit/debit transactions
Off the card and into the db/blockchain/wherever the heck i store it
I may have to just use any card provided api/FDX api
But thats not as secure as id want it to be
so wait
hold on
you wanna
use
actual money?
or you wanna use these as your credit cards
'Murica
ramesh
Hej
je suis ici
tu peux me questionner maintainent
ou demander
i broke it
did you?
try /. and anything as the write value
yeah
hi my name is cy
i know how to use good practices
are you using
mongoose
or like an ORM
no
idk what that is
or like raw queries
raw queries
k
i cant
inject
also mongodb bad
please dont become a MERN dev
what is MERN
Gewgle
what are these
what is express
You will eventually find out
and fall into a trap
what is it
Anyhow I really need to capture an emotion from almost 12 hours ago
and it is fading
which is highly problematic
um
I'll just take out my emotion capture net and do it
catch it
Uhm
yeah that stack is interesting
it seems more modern than say
LAMP
what do you use
MySQL
I actually used MongoDB once
I just don't like it since I'm crazy
SSPL
what is better about mySQL
they said it was bad
Mongodb is complex
mysql is complex
couchdb is good
I like couchdb for noSQL
I see
mongodb gave me free cloud hosting
people are interesting as well
what was that credit card thing
i got a credit card for stuff online
akhil wants to make like
his own currency
and digital banking system
and digital payments
yes
this is the answer
Tried this once
I got lazy
maybe not on akhil's scale though
and I wrote like 1 line of code
but I had the idea
I think JP also tried it
I was just thinking
What is the cost of getting a girlfriend
Since girls like to ask for your time
In return for their attention to you
it depends your job
Since time costs money…
What is the cost of "getting" a girlfriend?
GET http://girlfriend
since you are not secure
its http
HA
funny
cy now understands DBs
Ramesh now understands mutexes
what is a mutex
Not telling you
Although I definitely know
I know what it is ok
it's
a lock on a piece of data
for a thread to use
so that threads dont modify data at the same time
i see
What no
so explain
so you want
physical credit cards
Its to track the flow of real money
Its essentially an automated form of ledging and checkbook balancing for businesses/people
hi i dont do money
For know at least
I may integrate a crypto whenever I understand it enough
sorry im lost
what are you asking me
at a low level
Can i has credit card somehow track how much it spent
with a db
But i already found out the answer
Which is no
wdym
Cause findata is hella secure
what is findata
Financial data
you want to read
from actual ppls credit cards
Yup
how much they have spent
ah i see
yeah no
Well ideally not just their cards
But the entire account
So no
i see
So i gotta use the FDX api
Or the card issuers api
Which makes this annoying
i see
"Strive to be a better you!"
Just like make it a fake card
that works within your network
why dont setcharat work
this is big sad
i should switch to light theme
just to annoy ppl
yes
I use it
since I like it
i like it
but its too bright
like when im staring at something for long enough
i prefer it to be dark
likely honors
hmm alright
why
cause my english teacher was asking what we want to be recomended for
ur in cp tho
yea
i have A+ average rn
so i can go to honors, or AP
does that mean you can do AP?
hmm
idk tbh English and history are too tedius to do at an AP level
theyre not like more conceptual things like CS or Seminar/Research
then ill prob tell her honors
i gotta just keep my A
*knock on wood*
i think i have a B+ in honors rn
thats not to bad
so i cant do AP i think even if  i wanted to
i have a B+ in chem
i have an A in chem
Yes
what is this?
Akhil I am in the same boat as u, I think ima do honors
not ap
yea sounds better
also, you would have more time for other ap courses
also r u doin ap calc next year
cuz u do cp precalc right
yea
i dont think i can jump
idk i gotta ask
AP English sucks
Is it worth doing
Probably
For you
personally I regret taking it
But I'm me
Thats deep
r/im14abndthisisdeep
Bruhh
he likes it so far
"I'm being polite"
That's usually not a nice thing to say
why is it in linux font
i thought all the linux people
were democrats
That
idk
what linux font is tbh
idk
but
you show me fonts
some are linux fonts
Ramesh please fix this site
it has no title
or favicon
Say NO to favicon
Say NO to masks
that is how ridiculous
saying no to favicons is
Say NO to the USA
favicons aren't even political
no no no
just imagine
like
in the future
favicons
become political
democrats refuse favicons
because they waste energy
to serve to ppl
and that is bad for the environment
i swear
i will move to iceland
I will move
to Sweden
nah
north korea it is
ah yes
our old pal
김정은
our old NTSC
nobody gets my joke
Um
Isnt that the old tv broadcasting thing
Its the one that has the nice colors
PAL and NTSC
When nothing is airing
the 2 things that do the same thing
but are different
because the US and Europe
Must be different
Why cant the us be normal
I think NTSC came first
that is the US one
but
PAL was better for some reason
cuz it came next
but then
the US didn't wanna switch to PAL
cuz their stuff was already NTSC
im locked out of webassign
what were the login credentials
Ah webassign changed their login
Its ur bernardsboe
whats the password tho
And i think the first 3 letters of ur last name
um
Plus the last 4 digits of ur student code
no
not
Huh
work
Mines in that structure
wait
hold on
So pernia may be differente
i can find it my looking through my saved password
this is what happened i think
That as well
they changed the sign in to a new page
so the autofill didn't work
but if i find the credentials for the old page
in the saved passwords
hold on
mine was first 4 last name with caps
and first 4 id
but
hold on
nvm
i got in
Junk
Wtf do u mean
is this junk?
No
uhh
its a kinda popular game
then claim it?
yea
if u want
No
You should too
I already
did
I already have the game
ah
paid for it
haha
Yea 5$
was on sale for a holiday
forgot when

Hold on
the games like 70gb
warning u
Nah
mabye even like 80 ish
?
im going based on the size it took on my xbox so
Oh
Well
Lemme see then
its like 60 base
then an update hits u
and it jumps
right i forgot to say
its an EA game
"To the game"
isnt it “Play the Game”?
pretty sure it's to the game
“Its in the game”
thats what it is
fight me
oh wait
ah
the pronounce it like to the game
but like really fast
yup
i cringed less than usual
Looks nice
This got leeked pretty bad i think
Samsungs page was hiding the phone
ima watch some coverage
Looks decent
How much?
idk
forgot it was released today
just remembered
people are weird
im not sure i want another samsung
What cpu
does it have
1 x1 3 a78 4 a53
the entire soc
what is the name of the soc
Snapdragon 888
ew
or Exynos 2100
what about
exynos
exynos is unlockable
depends on region
but no hedfone
can i buy an exynos
no sd
1080p screen
uhm what
what refresh rate?
120
why
adaptive
is it
1080p
why
literally why
cuz why not
my moto x
had a 1440p screen
my galaxy s4
has a 1080p screen
i mean even apple is beyond that
the iPhone 11 was iPhone 4 level screen
ima just not buy samsung
im done with them
they dont have anything i want
i might
they have exynos
ill get a pixel 5 pro
and note
with 256gb
i would get a pixel 5
but it only has 128
or ill get a oneplus
I might just like
not buy a phone
ever
that is irrelevant
no once cares
about those
I care
why
or maybe a galaxy note
if they fix the issues
with the s21
but like theres no reason to go Samsung anymore
or maybe ill just get an iphone
why not
what do i lose
i get a better screen
more optimized software
more updates
more storage options
what
about gewgle
wdym
pixel
iphones are faster
will they make the same argument
get more updates
to buy a pixel
more optimized
more storage options
then get
an iphone
im considering it
im not gonna buy from a company that does not give me what i want
but you're winning the bet
i will not be brand loyal
oh
just you wait till you get an iphone
soon you will wish you had a mac
he's going to become a stereotypical teenaged mac MERN dev
hahaha
100%
U did
more like 80%
but close
100%
An exceptional
Unique person
becomes a boring person
because of apple
this is why apple should be deleted
please
ramesh
stop
with the brand loyalty
What brand loyalty
hating apple
that is not
is brand loyalty
brand loyalty
it is the same concept
just with not liking a brand
brand disloyalty
I just
dont
like apple
the thing is
and i dont
want to hear
why
bye
apple has advantages
i dont care
so my question is
objectively speaking
who makes a better product
I bought apple stock
new samsungs
they makin me money
have no expandable memory
i have lost almost every reason to use a Samsung phone
yea, wich is better for apple, bc they have a better product without the expandability advantage
so its apples to apple
haha
I have to debate this dumb bill on airline passangers
it sucks
i see
im go eat a snack
this idiot elitist
mac cultists
i hate apple
I hate apple too
but they make me money
it should be
broken up
"its just business"
all of big tech should be broken up
no
we wouldent have innovation
yes
amazon is cancer
and big r and d
we would
monee
no they are becoming anticompetitive
yes
and it needs to stop
like standard oil
for innovation
you need
competition
do u see how much amazon, google apple are all pumping into ai, quantum computing ect
yes
who cares
but guess what
do you know
they are
how much
anticompetitive
extremely
they would be pumping
especially apple
they wont be able to do it without big monee
also
if they had competitors?
I hope apple can be fractured into a milliion pieces
us small companies after the breakup wont be able to compete with the big ones overseas that will just munch the rest of the marketshare
like samsung
and hawhei
or however u spell
also
true
but
huawei
华为
overseas dont have big tech software
yea, but
we wont be able to make that softwhere
without the big tech mons
the thing is
when you break a company
that is why
you dont break it
you just
separate it
I want them further regulated
so like
aws would become its own thing
nonononoonononono
and amazon shopping would become its own thing
they did that with lucant technologies and the bell system
and amazon branded products
would die
it all fell downhill from there
that is why for those smaller things we need regulation
not seperation
i think my dad works for one of their pieces
after they broke off
i just hope like
yea, my grandpa was like a head at bell labs and was an exucutave at lucant
the government could like
before the scandle things
regulate amazon
yeaaa
so that they dont crush startups
not break it up
or kill the environment
and mistreat workers
yea, but not breakup
environment would be worse with smaller companies
well essentially
as with the workets
workers
what they have to do is be like
you have 2 choices
1. do the right thing
2. die
no
that is what capitalism does
on its own
the problem with capitalism
is trust
u get that everywhere
yeah
but so
someone is not gonna b more trustworthy if they socilism
you need to come in and be like
enough
enough is enough
and how would you do that
government
we the ppl
identify
that there is a problem
and say
stop problem
and amazon must obey
we the ppl indetify there is a problem and go somewhere else to buy our goods
well that's the problem
instead of loosing our jobs and working capital
we the ignorant ppl
what is socialism
ima eat a snack
hell
bye
wich then with the bad stuff happning rn, would make us more informed
yea. 62%
ima b taxed like a mothafucka
also free stuff
he won
no biden
I support trump and all
but honestly, he did not win
from the facts we have rn
yea
but we cant prove it
like widespred
so we have to keep our heads down
and ride it out
and the best way to do that, is through compromise
so crazy lib agenda does not get passed
ok
thanks for your political viewpoints
i do not support stopping the steal
that is just what I think
as do i
Yeah no I get it
also
i have to debate crazy dumb bill
on airline pilots
sry airline accommodation
new things
yes
this is genius
no but the link
has a timestamp
16000 for a bathtub
thats just pocketchange
First off
That screen looks hella cool
Second
Yes
Why would u not flush remotely
cuz
ur
supposed
to flush
after
process exited with code 2
But what if u wanted to do it with an app
what annoys me is this
kohler charges like $2500 for "app connectivity"
honestly
thats worse
than
$999
for a monitor stand
Hey hey hey
Its a good monitor stand
yes
but this
i mean
apple's $999 stand
looks cheap
compared to this "app connectivity"
which btw i can implement for around $0.38 into most of my applications
like
monitor stands can cost some money
especially if they are good
but app connectivity
is almost
never good
I feel like they would make the investors lustful
by displaying a bathtub
and
it's genius
its really cheap
cy is having fun on youtube
f f f find it t t t tag it
Thats great
the smart tag is available
for twenty nine
great british pounds
Yes
Thats not bad
wait what
ANC for $200
$200 launch price
which means much less
cuz no one pays launch price for Samsung stuff
Yup

no its different
shile ding is presenting
I am
not going
Starting APUSH rn
Nice
Good job
I le finished
that was fun
Yea that was good
i was gonna ask him more about mongodb
but
i think he said most of what needed to be said
Fun?
the MongoDB person
the presentation
Oh right that was today
yeah
Huh
it was just now
I wasnt gonna attend anyway
Solid
Gracias
Liquid
I made notes of the presentation of u want them
Nah im good
Like if anyone wants then
I can learn mongo from my dad
well the presentation was about data science
and machine learning
and the future of data
and tech
he said the word mongodb once
Hmm
Seems intresting
Yea it wasn’t too bad
I have to find out why my internet is bad
And is loading things in bytes
Tf are those antlers?
Samsung re-hired their marketing team
that they fired 2 years ago
this ad is not complete cringe
similar to the s20 one
R they a good team?
idk they just like
arent embarrassing themselves anymore
i guess that's good
i like how of the 25M new users in the 72 hours
0% were from north america
In what?
new telegram users
Ah
Telegrams good tho
Is nice
hi uma murkin ah yuz ah-messidge
Or whatsapp
literally no one
in the us
uses whatsapp
other than like
ppl who wanna talk to ppl outside the US
i mean i remember years ago
like 6 years ago
my Lebanese relative asking me to get whatsapp
WhatsApp is preinstalled on my $25 smartwatch
from chiyna
Haha
Whatsapp is okay
omg i like click on an ltt livestream
and i find linus just like
on the ground
?
then i turn time back
and its the funniest thing
he literally
tries to limbo under an ethernet cable
Dropped himself
fails
then
tries again
Oh no
to do a roll
under the cable
but then
theres a pen in his back pocket
and it gets caught on the cable
Oh god
then he moves backwards
removes the pen
then
he rolls
and his legs completely snag the cable
and everything falls
and he falls
Perfect
Linus is great
How
How
How did he do this
*literally dying
I have no words
To explain how magnificent this is
Right here
Add that find out next episode meme
haha
Whats a good router
My routers busted and i need to get a new one
wdym your router is busted
Idk
Optimum says our router has a problem
idk maybe go for like ubuqiti networks
Hence why we dont have internet
Its gotta be relatively cheap
And at bestbuy
oh
this one looks good
for the price
its wifi 6
AX3000
I kinda dont need wifi 6
Cause i dont support it
But sure
ow rite
ur a mak person
Yup
then just get literally any of them
idk anything about wifi
routers
is that decent?
Cy todays the first time im gonna be spending like till 11 doing hw
Imma just go to bestbuy and find one
People
I have internet
Its garbage speeds
But it there
I saw this
which livestream?
send me a link
i wanna watch later
it was on yt as like a post thing
this link has a timestamp
this guy
does the best
mic tests
Hi I'm SHA-256
I don't really know what I like
but I know I don't like you
Hi I'm Cy
I don't really know who I like
do you get the analogy
but I know I don't like you
No
SHA-265 is a hashing algorithm
Yes
I know that
what else
It does not know your password
that's good
but it can tell you what is and is not your password
Yes
yknow those moments
where you are like
I dont like that
then someone asks you what you do like
and you tell them
idk
Je gagne
Adieu
wdym
wdym
Bruhhh
i click it
and it says
"please be discreet"
"you will now see nude photos"
and im like
no
i dont wanna see em
Hahhhahahahha
cy is debugging his humidity control system
it has a bug
where it doesn't work when it first boots up
it like
requires doing things
like
i think
when it first boots up
the humidity has to go below the low threshold before it actually sets the humidifier state correctly
cuz it assumes the system is on
at boot
i believe
wait
no
its the other way around
it assumes its off
and it has to go down below the threshold
for it to confirm it is on
but
well
and then when it rises above the threshold it will stop the humidifier
the problem is this will cause runaway
because if the humidifier is on
Cy
Stop
and it requires the humidity to go below the threshold to realize this
it will never realize it
because since it is on
the humidity will keep rising
Bruh enough
dnd is a thing
did u study for inglish and komp sci
Comp sci not rly
By English yes
what is limo
Just studied passive and active voice
And vocab
this tho
And reviewed the questions
Idk
wdym
How did u study for English
then
slides
and
sparknotes
Which slides
im at my "do not go to bed hour"
various ones
on parallelism
and vocab
Yea same
and that stuff
see if i go to bed right now
i will be dead tmrw
i have to wait like half an hour
lol
the reason is
Enjoy your half an hour
my sleep cycle
i have identified
Lol
if i go to bed around half hour before midnight
i am in deep sleep at 6am
and i am dead the whole day
Okay
Thank you for describing your sleep cycle
you should identify yours
I will now prescribe that you sleeps earlier so you deep sleep comes at a earlier time
yeah its either before 11
or around midnight
I sleep and I wake up... that’s about it
lol
ima continue debugging my humidity control system
Lol go for it
thx
its literal spahgetti kode
Ooof
the worst kind
wait it was the most trivial thing
I thought the second letter of the word ON
was O
god help me
Cy
Wth
On is two letters
the thing is
i was doing
string
or in this case
char array
so like it was string[1]
and somehow i said
Wait are u studying for comp sci
if string[1] == 'O': the humidifier is on
HAHAHA
but that is wrong
in like
so many ways
cuz like
if it is off
R u studying for comp sci
the first character will be O
but
Lol
that's not the first character
its the second
Ik
it was like 2am
im certain
when i was putting that together
my brain worked
and then
it didnt
Lmao
the system is now working
Nice
it works over mqtt
I do understand how this works beside the code but nice
the main reason i was editing the code
was to change the setpoint
because it was set to 50%
and
um
i have various issues with hardwater and ultrasonic humidifiers
creating
mineral dust
and breaking my stuff
Lol
like i think
my numworks
the buttons dont always click right
i think its because
of this issue
and white dust collects on everything
so i moved the setpoint to 35-40
as opposed to 47-53
hopefully this solves my issue
Okay
also then hopefully i dont have to fill the damn thing up every 12 hours

hi my phone battery is at 84 percent
it was fully charged this morning
when i woke up
and i used it for one minute
to check the battery percentage
83% now
Im at 53
but you didn't charge
overnight
It was charged this morning
but you used it
Yea for like 4 hours
i used mine
for one
minute
literally
1
3 minutes now
wait
maybe i knocked it off the charger
cuz i was not awake 2h20m ago
but really
this is terrible
this is unacceptable
6.4%
it unacceptable
this phone does not get me through one day
with light to no use
that's it imma get a chinaphone
with android one
they dont have enough money make software that uses this much power
mine doesnt either
but to be fair i use it like for 6 hours straight
this
i used my phone for 1h yesterday
what was i even doing for 1h
im going to buy not a samsung
whats annoying
is like
if i had bought that
i would have already had android 11
that phone is like $300
mi a get android updates before samsungs
the problem is that has an absolutely awful screen
its amoled
and the good ends there
its HD+
that means 720p
a 6.1 inch 720p oled
looks awful
Rust time
yes the price is dropping
this is good
it is getting within budget
should seduction be illegal
hi my battery is at 78%
le get it
and make ur pickle 3 work
no its gonna keep dropping
it was like $95 last time
the lowest

no
cy wants to add google sign in to a website
but its too much of a mess
No change
but
Less lines of code
yes
always better

why does this use UDP
isnt UDP old
and bad
and unreliable
what am I supposed to use then
CloudSockets?
TCP
with Blockchain?
websockets
Web
i am allergic
to the web
ramesh
its a protocol
you dont have to do webdev
yes
I am
to use websockets
allergic
to
I just wanted to learn
low level stuff
but you should learn relevant stuff
like TCP
TCP is relevant
Ah yes
UDP is not
Everyone telling me what I do is irrelevant
and not worthwhile
+1 to list
well im just saying the UDP part
but yeah
Rust is not irrelevant
so
I can
program my wii
if that makes me happy I will program my wii
Even though it is not relevant
i mean im just saying
It doesn't matter to me
if you are gonna make a real time game
whether or not
use TCP websockets
Oh right
not UDP
Did I tell you
Minecraft servers use UDP?
Not websockets?
game servers
use
udp
they are old
also
Can confirm
they are lossy streams
^ among us
Can confirm
Lots of games use udp
fortnite
Especially for server stuff
Thank you for telling me
UDP is irrelevant
this is ingame, btw
k so i did some look up
and i determined
what it is
TCP has error correction and is good for all thing, but it has overhead
UDP
is dumb
and simple
but
it has much less overhead
so it is better for streaming
It is better
for games
yes because they need low latency and to stream a lot of data
but
i would still
use TCP websockets
for a game like yours
Too bad
I wanted to do something cool
wdym too bad
And like
I used UDP
So
I'm not switching it
but why do you think udp is a better option
other than that
show me
the rust api
for websockets
well that's a rust issue
no
just look it up
websockets
i dont doubt there is one
i just want to make a point
This
sends structs
also does UDP even have security?
probably
TLS
I wanted to
implement this myself
look you do you
im just saying
i would have done it with websockets
Uhm
See the goal of this project
was to learn about udp
then fine
also
game servers use udp
go tell all the game developers
to use
websockets
ones that have to stream
player details
in real time
Yes
you are not
I am doing
that
streaming
anything
just so you know
I am streaming
guess events
such as
to
no
clients
that's not a stream
in real time
a stream is like
the position
it doesn't close
of all the Minecraft players
all the sheep
all the cows
how would you even implement that
all the time
you have to send packets
one at a time
yes
I am doing that
all the time
there can be more than one game
you are continuously sending?
at a time
on the server
if the server is being utilized a lot
yes
like you have a while loop
yes
that just sends
and threads
to handle
forever
that's inefficient tho
requests
you only need to send
when events occur
Yes
the thread only spawns
when an event get sent
the websocket
is better
Idc
I want
to learn
udp
so I did this
then fine
I really don't think
websockets
would make a huge difference
they would have a lower error rate
Then
there is no fun
in trying to fix errors
and support browser clients
I literally
do not
care
about
browsers.
period.
I hate web dev
you are like me 4 years ago
i was like
Yes
screw browsers
i hate
And I used to like
web browsers
browsers
web dev
and then it got repetitive
and annoying
and stupid
5 years ago i liked google docs cuz it was browser
so I am done with it
4 years ago
i hated google docs
cuz it was browser
2 years ago
i liked google docs
cuz it was browser

hi i talked with my English teacher
about my YouTube tracker app
who is your english teacher
Harding
she said she might use it
oh
even tho she was not the one to ask for it
cuz she told me
well yknow i make videos sometimes
but i doubt my seniors actually watch them
so if i could track that
it would be nice
and maybe i would make more videos
seniors?
oh
seniors
hi Ramesh can i ask you something
do you leave telegram open on a second screen
while doing other things
Yes
Usually
depends on what I'm doing
I see
why
idk i noticed weird behavior coming from your profile
and i determined this could only be why
so i just wanted to confirm
What is the weird behaviour
you come online and start typing at almost the same time
and you appear to have read my messages
before actually "reading" them
hmm
how does this
confirm what you were thinking
cuz i started doing that myself
and realized
that was how i was appearing
i was reading ur messages
without "reading" them
cy learned how hashes work
so now
he can store users' credentials in his MongoDB
Oh
I also learned how hasing works
tell me
how a hashmap works
idk what that is
i learned about its application
in password
and credential management
ramesh
do you have any sites
that use credentials
Uhm
Yes
which one
and how does it do it
Not hashing
That is a TODO
well
You can steal the api keys
that doesn't use credentials
if you get into the db
it uses API keys
same thing actually
no
well
the api key
is literally
a password
ok lemme rephrase
just so you know
sites
that use
accounts
I do
They are not live
but I have made webapps that do
and this multihangman will have accounts
how do they store passwords
and credentials
in the db
raw
passwords
in the db
hashed
duh
salted?
maybe
idk
i dont think so
why would u salt
for 2 reasons i think
the first reason
is so that 2 same passwords
will have different hashes
and the second reason
is it increases difficulty of brute force attacks
if your db is compromised
huh
cuz like
they can have dbs
of passwords
and their hashes
but
if the hashes are salted
those dbs do not work
now i just need to learn how to store access keys in a cookie
and how to transmit that cookie
to the server
Oh right
have fun
every time a user requests
I gave up with SPAs
they are stupid
est
what is SPA
no words for you
I love logic glitches
single page applications?
what
wdym
SPA = Single page application
no i get that
but like
Click
no do reload
but why do that
faster
why
you have to load like
evrything
and all the logic
to manage it
the first time
the page is loaded
i think its so u dont have to load anything else
so it may take a bit longer to load initially
ima just do it the normal way
and have a login page
hence why they may have like the cool loading thingy
and an app page
i mean thats what most people do
single pages r more for product information and stuff
also mining is intresting as heck
its so clever
Ooh
I should learn
Copy you
yea its intresting stuff
blockchain only works cause of miners
I did a bunch of line removal
now I have to write my font resource manager
ah yes
nah
im writing an rcfont
RcFont
Based on this
imma make it work first
i have one
hi im a pc; ima mac; and im linix
you dont like me, but i work; you like me, but i dont work; you want to like me, but im a lot of work
only applies to macs
Literally just so I can do this
sigh
did I send a gif
I didnt mean to
no u didnt
yes
so I can run windows
macos
and linux side by side

should i make the translatebot
work
Yes
pls
convince me to spend 10 minutes
with certbot
i really dont like her
shes nice sometimes
It's not a she
it's a he
but then she just leaves
like
right when
you are about to make it work
she leaves
its so maddening
then she takes your stuff
and you spend like
the rest of your time
searching for her
and trying to get your stuff back
ima make the translatebot work
but like
i really want my wildcard ssl
so this is not a pain in the hss
if we're using h
time to install diesel
oh my god
this is so much
faster

I still have gym homework
haha
the number of errors
keeps going UP
Ah
nice
I might just like
switch to another library
Okay time to switch libraries
I am very smart
AHHHHH HELPPPPPP
wait
you
you got it but they cancelled
On hold wtf does that mean
update
YOUR PAYMENT DETAILS
GO TO THE THING AND UPDATE IT NOW
I am but it doesn’t do anything
I still get the same thin
Google
ask in the stonks server
idk
Is it cuz I’m using debit card?
probably not
go ask in stonks
No its prob cause the banks declining the payment
From what it seems
Check/Call the card issuer and see if they stopped the payment
DOES THIS MEAN WHAT I THINK IT DOSS?

telegram has no passwords
it does
wait
hold on
telegram
cu I just entered one
has 2 factors
but they are backwards
I found it in keepass tho
it does notification on phone as single
lunix
and notification and password as double
probably not
that seems like a lunix cursor
password is optional
yay unigram
you should
make your cursor
less lunix
so I can tell what OS you use
oh ew it makes a worse noise

No i find it very distrating and disruptive we must see white men in in good light Okay thanks.
what
that's racist
what generates that?
it takes
5 random messages
i sent to ramesh
at some point
in the past 3 years
and combines them
makes the first letter capital
and puts a period at the end
huh
using
this feature
no im not I mean just run the 5v through the cable.
999 for latest phone Resistors are not .4 cents. They are $20.004 Like the whole thing im not gonna comment on clothing opinions.

5 times
the api is really fast
also
lame
has a
counter
at the bottom now
of where
wdym
of where
oh i cant see it
invisible
its realllly light
you are not supposed to see it
unless i point it out
i broke it lol
well
i mean
whats the cyquote
k i was worried u found it in normal user territory but u were in speshul user territory so its fine
lololo
lolo
image not having an autoclicker with 0ms delay
ok but that was not the point
the point
was to do it by hand
wait calum
can you go to
on your phone
and press transmit
oh wait
the ws server is not up
its realllly light 
you are not supposed to see it 
unless i point it out
do this
on your phone
then you can go to it on ur pc
and do recieve
i did
no reload
and click "make it work"
false null null null
on your phone?
you have to open the transmit on ur phone
this would be a message
ws: connection error
not iOS
undefined
not iOS

not iOS

not iOS

not iOS

not iOS

no reload
now
wait
it connect
then null error
no no
null error
is irrelevant
are u on phone
or on pc
no
that's cuz
i opened it
on my phone
here
but now
open the site
on ur phone
why does it die
every time
you try
ok
hold on
did u open on phone
or on pc
phone
tf is this
oh working
i switched from brave to chrome
ah
also my screen is having a stroke
spamming numbers
yeah it works on safari and chrome
yes
60 samples
per second
brave is based on chrome
no but
that's not
relevant
cuz the part that does the orientation stuff is not
thats different in each browser
lol
lol
but brave is like chrome
ik
but no google
samsung internet is like chrome
but it doesn't work right
like i said
chrome and safari
work right
whats toggle niceness
it toggles the smooth motion
cuz sometimes the smoothing thing breaks
and glitches
i dont see a difference
um
idk
lol it froze
ima put my phone on a spinning thing
put it in the microwave
and turn it on
it fell
wtf is happening
?
its like
going all over
is it on a spinning thing
nging
ñiñ
ṅiṅ
yeah
what are you doing
to that server
nothing
h{q to login
why
is it having
a literal spasm
so am I
i should sleep
*Sigh
time to turn on
*cygh
cloudflare
heathen
there we go
no more ddos
sad
cyghs
now
i have session
and http POST working
which
believe it or not
i did not know how to use
until just now
u know
ramesh is descending
into insanity
when he starts listening to bts songs
Koreeah
yes
that country
Eyeohesse
ios
but
eyeohesse
yes
is bad
cy is making login work
hashing is not a thing yet
but
is a thing
k
create an account
n
im doing something
it takes
3 seconds
Okay now I will
i got my stupid thing to work
lemme record and show and then i will
wait
why is it not
doing anything
wait it works now
yes
i see you
raylib
in my mongodb
is cool
ok so now to make the signin actually do something
cuz right now
the sign in
just takes any username
do not send
long images
they do not appear
send
less long
images
make them taller
i see
im going back to my sign in page
gbye
hashing is implemented.
now to implement session keys
*sigh
Hi its cy at 2am
i just finished my 150 lines of sign in logic
but it is fully secure and done now
the hell is this ip
how many requests do u get from russia and china?
idk i got a few last night
but this is the problem
weak
you see
my server
is behind
cloudflare
and NGINX
and somehow
their ips
ohhhhh
are accessing it
hmm
directly
ah this is why
It now
does not look
like horrible rectangle spacing issues
hm
my sign in thing works now
it even has sessions
so if you logged in on some sketchy computer
you can go to
and log out
i wanna
hamgna
idk
you can log out individual sessions
zhong guo
deutscheland
how do i sign in
france
no so
create an account
how
also y upstairs
dont ask
kill?
yes
you can kill sessions
remotely
so like i said
if you open privat browrser
and sign in
then reload
sessions
in the first one
you can kill the session
in the private browser
you can sign out individual sessions
without changing your password
akiru
wait these astats are wrong
Uwu
oh thats just last week
this is all of last month
I didn't kill it
it just died
and i didn't undie it
i need to host it on my rpi
cuz it was being hosted on my desktop
which was bad
L
the problem is
also
idk how much bandwidth
it uses
and how much CPU
ur linkpage is kinda broken
yeah the last link
all of them are the same link
oh that
well notice
how its still
an html xpermient
i hate that color
too bad
🤮
i should eat food
also
i just woke up
y does the text move
APU
CyPU
Application Processing Unit
Cy PU
CPU
its like nausieating
Cy Processing Unit
show me a good website
you have made
actually ima go do this
ttyl
but i mean i havent like been bothered rlly
ive been doing more backend stuffs
so like
team lethal esports
my latest project has no gui
yeah i made that for my friend
I know someone
who runs a team lethal esports
its like some stuff
for the actual analytics i just made it output a table
but like nothing real
my main website hasnt been edited in likt 2 years
cuz idrc
cy
yes
how are the passwords stored
are they hashes or smthn?
salted hashes
hm
why
can they be unhashed
by definition, no
k
assembly
yes
is it useful to learn asm
wait
imma do something
k
i need to figure out how to delete everything in my database
since im changing how users are made
thats the point tho
yes
so
Consider not glorifying it
hi im facebook
and you are irrelevant to me
yet
you are my business
M
-M-
is a french
composer
-m-
bye
i have work
bye
cy its broken
i have to enter a new name
ow wait
hold on
also
how do i make a share
you dont
yet
hm
i am implementing that
now
also
yes
everything goes to that one page
yes
well
not everything
like i cant see my account
no so
anything
not explicitly set
will go to that page
so that
hm
i can have like
lol
be a video id
to vew the share
oh cool
but isnt that bad
cuz if u put a video id
what if 2 ppl wanna share that video
then its the same id
no
the shareID
sorry
oh
hm
2 shares can have the same video
why is it not somthing like /share/id
buhcuz i wanita look gud
because what if the id is account
then it breaks
the id will not be account
because
i will make sure
the length of the id
is not the length
of any explicit paths
but that if i break the thing and send requests of stuff
?
like the connect4
i can just send random stuff to it
and hack the game
i mean
i can protect
against
that
to a certain extent
i mean
hmmmm
this is for like
teachers
with
like
non tech
students
lol
no one i know
has like
the intent
to do that
especially in class
or the knowledge
isnt it funny when the technology teacher cant use a computer
this is not for the technology teacher
this is for the AP Seminar teacher
what is that
some class thats interesting
hm
its kinda hard
but then again
i have a 104% in it
marketing forgot what an OS is
k
so now
you can put a ytVideoID as the path
and see it work
sort of
but no actual shares yet
Custom server support is coming to the game
plus db connections
and stuff
MultiHangman?
oui oui
i see
cy는 chatting 좋아해요
ramesh likes chatting
uhh
Су는 chatting 좋아해요
Someone, likely Ramesh, has said something that will not be translated.
Hmm
that is strange
I said
Cy likes chatting
you must have said lickes
I literally did not
fix her hckin bot
i could
but
im not
why
is u lazy
im working on stuff
k
i should sweep
is saw that
like
26 times
its a good commercial
this is almost a thing
flask
yes
LFMuN stack
MerN
MERN
Linux Flask Mongo uWSGI NGINX
I personally prefer Php + mysql
im not sure about uWSGI yet
raw php ofc
i havent learned php
i could
but
no
php
sucx
ima write this one in python
why
why
it just sucks
it is like
clunky
when used raw
why u use then
with laravel it's good
didn't know anything else existed
ah
*cough
me
*cough
flask
try
ruby on rails
no
for now
that's the only thing I would use
im not
trying
anything
for web dev
flask is "cancer"
why
it is
slow
to work
ruby is faster to make things wokr
also ruby syntax nicer
i see
maybe next time
please
that is repeated code
?
i hate lifetimes
ik i could do it myself
but no
Ok so I uh
what
Rewrote the entire thing in
raylib
when I could have just fixed the lifetimes
*sigh
as I just did
is this for like
the ui?
so ramesh is a royal idiot
yes
why
are you using Rust™
Since I want to learn how to use it
but it works now so idc
k
also like
raylib just like magically solved
works
a really stupid bug
but
that I couldn't figure out
not for real
it like
where the program would crash randomly
can find video ids
now it doesnt
wow
*yawn
i should sleep too
im making this thing
more ux
i should make (x for x in literally_everything) work
so instead of editing code
yu type in ip
and it saves it
k
err
i dont feel like working on PlayTools anymore this evening
Yes, I like this
pointless windoe
but then again
this exists
cy
wth is this
uhm
How about "Okay"
^^timestamped
Even better
This is what I knew about
haha
it now actually creates
stuff
*literally dying
8 megabytes
is big
for such a small
thing
Why
cuz
yes.
you can even see the hair if the light is bright enough
Nvidia Hairworks
im actually surprised by how well this worked
should I
try it
Yes
how hard is it
took me 10 minutes of work
tell me how
took my printer like 4 hours or something
whack
you essentially
take a photo
upload it to this tool
which turns it into an STL
of like the brightness
then you cut off the bottom margin
Hmm
like the bottom thickness
Oikay
and then
cuz its bad
and then
pwint
you set some settings
okay ill try it tomorroh
make it thin laier
0.05mm
also
make the first layer thicker
and higher flow rate
then print
'kay
tmrw
k
it looks realllly ugly
until its completely done
is
song
憂鬱
Melancholy
it means like
oh
utsu means depression
Yes
Let's
Run an x86 VM on ARM
And watch it get 1 fps
i swear
every time
i look at it
69%
this needs to end
it is reminding you
of sexuality
which one
i have a lot of domains
uhh
isnt this a long story
um
i made it short
clearly too short
for calum
yeah lol
so he asks for more
some random guy
on the internet
gave it to me for 10 years
does this sound like a lie
sounds sus
well guess what
that is literally what happened
im gonna move it to namecheap and renew for 30 more
after I get some monies
freenom yeeted mine
so like I'm gonna get a real one
Uh
github student developer pack
yea
but that's 1 year
I'm looking for all the options
I have 10
wait
idk just get from namecheap
porkbun
no u
its cheaper
yeah probs am
no
porkbun?
that one
hm
yea i pay like 20$ a year for my 2 domains
8 for a .com
wait
12 for a .me
wait
wait
wait
can u transfer to porkbun?
yea
they also have 2$ a month email hosting
hm
cost?
if it's cheap I am switching
hm
could I get a year on name cheap and then transfer?
yeah
pog
yea
I'ma probs do that then
still costs 26 dollars to transfer to pork
how much is pork's email?
oof
no
it's only for my domain
since mine is a .tv
some are free to transfer
oh
2$ a month
Nah
ill go fastmail
yea i would as well
they do have free email redirects
which is what im doing rn
hm .me domains are 12
yea they aint bad
.tv tho
lol
yes
crates?
yes
rust
hm
is it a domain
no
so what is it
did they email back?
no
damn
school is nice
free adobe
it is
my previous one game me free adobe cs6
but not premiere
unless u found the one from like 1990
my current one will give u a VM with it but only for specific classes
u can pirate it
extremely easily
it's like trivial
cc?
yes
you just
install the free trial
download the patcher
close cc
run patcher
open cc
the end
hm
ive done it before
b4
what do you see
im sorry
what
does that mean
Accident
but keep it
?
ah good
now
could you
go to
and make a share
no
later
why
it takes like 2.5 seconds
ok now i will
also add opengraph support
please
what is that
google
what
you click "use current name"
if that wasnt clear please let me know
it wasnt
hmm
k
what does this mean?
so
essentially
"viewers"
are people
"views"
are like
the number of times it was clicked
"viewers" doesn't work yet
cuz essentially
for my teacher
he wants to know how many ppl watched
not how many times
it was watched
me:
no so
it will track
all that
with WebSockets
oLYBUceID
just casually not listening to Rick Astley

weird statement cy
*Not Cy
hmm
does it do it for you too
But then i didnt wdym My printer is broken Okay.
like if you say
"cy likes pie"
does it
say ramesh likes pie
yes
so it is impossible
for the bot to say cy
yes
I see
it cannot comment on me
on others' behalfs
yeah but that's cY
not cy
so
this is becoming a problem
hold on a moment

jif you go to
it may work
it may not work
ah if i explicitly state https
since it does not use cloudflare anymore
does it work
if you explicitly state
ok
i will fix that
later
it hasn't
propagated for me yet
but
those
are not
my emotes
um
yes
try
using an emote you uploaded
so like
it was like
working right
before
it works now
i think
right uhm
and i had to explicitly state https
ill fix it
i cant test it since it hasn't propagated yet
wdym
it worked
on the test
server
i see
okay
now I can
it is like
having a spasm
nginx misconfiguration
engineks
or enginix
should I try caddy
sure
i should do homework
but
im listening to music
and i cant do homework and music
at the same time
and i like music
how do i shutoff unigram?
idk
you can probably like
it wont stop
wdym
like exit
completely?
yea
um
windows settings
i killed it with task manager
and it didnt stop
haha
idk i never had issues
so idk
i should try mesos
tbh idk what happened
but it should work better now
and now it doesnt
ah
if you add a trailing slash it doesn't work
yes
i fixed that though
works
yes
with https
how did you do it with linode tho
what did it require
certbot
no in terms of authentication
An API key
you can restrict it to only work for domains
yes
now
instead of being able to work with other stuff
i wish that feature
which is advertised
as working
use linode instead of cloudflare
in the cloudflare one
actually worked
I got it to work
actually
with cloudflare
perfectly fine
how
but
it wont work with
freenom domains
uhm
why
idk
i just used like
the pip version
i see
and like
it was finnicky
but after wiping out every other certbot install
i have no need for subdomains yet
and just using the pip3 in root
it worked
werent u like
trying to do this
i was
and like found it
prohibitively difficult
close to prohibitively
try again
it works
the problem is it like
deletes everything
and breaks everything
every time
i think it will work
try it
if you already
installed certbot from pip
i installed it from apt
ok remove that
but then what
will the pip one like
restore all the data
from the apt one
it uses
the same directories
i see
i also
have the cloudflare
one installed
from apt
remove that too
it wont work
itll be outdated
also idk what other crap I installed
from everywhere
fine lets give this a try
yes
tf is this sequence
okay
let me help
do this
then log out
log in
and then try
oh
you might have installed certbot locally
in which case run
already running this
whatever
this failed
the first one
and this failed
the second one
this is fine
this means it still worked
now try
should i log out
and back in
yes
k
try cloudflare with your restricted token now
see um
it didn't ask me
for any credentials
file
Did you
do the
uh
like
credentials file
i have one
but
it didn't ask me
for one
who cares
it doesnt
its not supposed to
then how should it renew
it needs to renew
it probably remembers
wdym
i never
gave it
the key
how did it validate in the first place?
there was some thing in my dns
lemme try again without that
*sigh
no
it still
doesn't work
idk
it works for me
ill just like
manually renew mine
yknow what it might be
im on ARM
and maybe its not compiled
oh uhm
no
no
for arm
no
no
no
add ur email
keep the token
add ur email
wdym
add
why
i only have 2 tries left
dns_cloudflare_email
then i have to wait a week
idk it works like that
also this doesnt take tries
ur not like
making one
each time i retry it
it takes
one
it only counts if it works
of the 5 attempts
per week
yes but
it works
every time
for some reason
send me
the entire output
of the previous attempt
not the snippet
it only did it once
?
it only worked once didn't it
yes
i dont see it making a certificate more than once
only the first time
no
it like
this is the last attempt
of 3
ykw idk
i just use
linode
and be happy
what i dont get
is how it works
the first time
and not
when it renews
it works the first time
regardless of everything
this is very clear
the rest of it
heres
the thing
it should renew
but how come
it requires no credentials
or anything
it stores
when you first run it
the file
i inputted
no file
it says
credentials
the first time
this
full screenshot
oh
bc it recorded ur file already
thats how
but i just installed it
how
it
doesnt delete
ur old configuration
stuff
it had tho
because
it doesnt
delete
/var/certbot
or whatever
this happened
after that
that's
not wildcard
what
it is tho
idk
idk
look idk
i see
it works
hence
ramesh shall ignore it
?
for me
ah
and technically for you
just so you know
back in the old days
there were no plugins.
so you had to manually do it
and then wait 12 hours
and then try certbot
and hope bad things no happen
i think for now
ill just stick
to regular certs
mhm
well i needed a wildcard for emotes
when i need wildcard
i will cross that bridge
when i get to it
but also
mq02 is broken
*tired
*has some hw
*will not fix mq02
*no not tonight
this
._.
yes
that is a thing
it was written by teenagers
probably
i like how kognise claims
to be
some 13 year old
he is like 14 right
also
it's <13 not <=13
tbh idk the whole deal with kognise
and doggo
and all that business
he ignores me
I tried to file a bug report with him on discord
really?
he answered me
I also thanked him for the service and he ignored me
but
if he's busy ig that makes sense
how tho
like i dont get it
parents
freedom
wdym how tho
how does a 14 year old
get a card
i mean
i guess
i could
they are not 13
not
idk
i was 14 in ninth grade
and I knew flask
so
true
i need to write a privacy policy for playtools
and add bad person protection
jp was like
ppl are gonna come
and break it
jp
is correct
how do i implement that tho
just say "I added encryption" to him
and he will stop
saying anything
no hes like
ppl are gonna script it
ik
just say
cuz you totally can
i added encryption
Literally those words
well actually
its behind
cloudflare
under high protection mode
so likely not
haha
i wonder what I'm doing wrong
nothing
this book is filled with swear words
hm
lets go
Collegeboards dropping SAT subject tests
and the essay on the actual SAT
wdym
u can no longer take the subject tests
what
and they r no longer offering the essay
link to source plz
its for the pandemic but they may continue it
NYT also has an article
hmm
i like this
it means a more even playing field
i mean AP exams are like 100 bucks each but yea
its nice
but its annoying as heck
why
i needed either a 5 on 3 AP exams or 700+ on 3 subject tests
for what
admission requirements
for what
for University of Oxford
but i mean
if there are no more subject tests
they will update that
its not a US school
but
then
wait
is collegeboard an American thing
or is it global
Yes
American
but they have global locations
but then like
i mean if the university wanted subject tests
they cant be like
oh you still need subject tests
that you cant take
i mean yea
thats prob why they added an AP part as well
*sigh
im working on playtools
the menu
is less crap
its a bit better
i made the radii correct
and the buttons bigger
for easer use on mobile
ehh theyre still too small
lemme make em bigger
there
much better
also
im debugging on a live server
so like
every edit i make
wait WHAT
WHAT
WHAT
qHAT?
where
send
gododofasldfkjasl;fkjsal;fj
links above
poggy woggy
my
subject test gets cancelled?
yup
pog
however they may/might not count anymore towards college applications

and my password is Password
yes
um
i have class
bye
adieu
fixed
click the link again
it now leads to the right place
cy is dealing with timestamps
the worst thing
to deal with
idk if they are even all in UTC
i think
my timestamps are all in UTC
but
i need to make sure
so that if i run my app in Iowa
it wont cause all my times to be messed up
but then also
i need to make sure that all the times are displayed in EST for users
and now
they are displaying in EST
but
idk whether
that is
no
this must
end
i hate
this
there is EDT
as well
a;sdlfkaj;sdlkfj;aslkdjfasdf
yall get unix time
no
i cannot
no
this must work
no i dont like this
no
cy has solved the time problem
using moment.js
time
cy has 20 minutes to eat snack
then
its an intresting think isnt it
he has to interview grandpa
as humans, are lives kinda depend on time
yes
and now
my website
shows the right time
based on your timezone
as opposed to a unix timestamp
good luck reading that
why is time different in different places
cuz
now
i gotta go
eat a snack
gbye
and admire working time
Ooh snowing
ah yes
i has to interview grandpa now
and
im gonna use
the google recorder
oral history?
yes
ah
and the google recorder
yes…
I did Father for that
will auto transcribe
My friends did Mr. Galesi
?
HUSH
This is just a test to see if the Google recording app is actually gonna work so I'm just gonna like, I'm not really sure but. I don't know say a few things yeah. I mean, okay, so well. Here's a question, what is it? Okay, well, I see you heard my question. 

So how about you answering? 

Are you not gonna answer? That's sad. Well, I guess we'll have to end there this recording has been 46 seconds actually now it's 52 and now it's 54 and now it's 56. Okay and let's. Bring this to an end.
ah
oh that is smart
I also used a TTS
i used my gcp subscription
and wrote a program to transcribe all of it
and just filled in what was missing
yeah imma just use this app
cuz it does that
all
automatically
i wanna find my script
Ah
Discord is down
Oh no
wait ramesh
how long
was your oral history
idk
too lazy to look
like generally speaking
1h?
0.5h?
Umm
let me check
k
See
I have no clue
i did it in parts
and slowed it down
im just like
so the tts would eat it
how long should this go
more happily
k wait
i think
i dont wanna be too long
it says in the rubric also
or too short
wait it does
hold on
9:49 + 6:51 + 11:49
Add that
i am going dnd
bye
adieu
still online
?
what was that thing
that you said
i should use
for like
chats
like add to my website
opengraph
yes
this really watches like a meme video
uploading
It really does
Man what a presidency
Its unbelievable that its been 4 years
Feels like he was elected a couple months ago
nah
not for me
i mean
i do remember the night he was elected
but
It does not feel like 4 years
i was much smaller
i lived in Bridgewater
Really?
yes
I don’t remember anything from back then
i watched on the big tv downstairs
in my pajamas
then
i got tired
and realized
i didn't care
and went to sleep
then i woke up
and my mom
an anti-trumpist
came to me
and told me that trump had been elected
in 7th grade
we stood up
and said "not my president"
on inauguration day
CRUD
what
yes. full on account and session management. finally
wait they should be sorted by date/time
Huh
Im trying to figure out what im gonna say for my gym flipgrid
I have no clue what to do besides life a textbook up
come on
30 seconds
you can do it
this is my
uh
pause for 5 seconds
Yea but
resistance
It has to be creative
tool
pause for 10 seconds
then be creative
sound happy
U gotta say more than that
U gotta say like why weight training is good
yes
i did this in like 1 minute
it took me 0 time
you have been doing this since like
yesterday
Well no
Its more like i put it off till today
I see
Anyone want an intel mobo for $135 lmao
um
not for $135
bot protection.
at least for sign up
this site cannot persist
it needs to end
maybe
like
big maybe but maybe
i will think about it
If not I will probs j go to eBay
it no work
whenever I go off the page
it no stop video
or Is it just to log
whoever watched the video
it is supposed to just log
it keeps playing even when you leave the page
although
well
yeah no it would not be very easy to implement that
mq
cy
cy pic
from cy's channel
wait
WAIT
hold on
is it really
THAT easy
literally some static crap / videoID / mqdefault.webp
haha that's the 4k version
this is fun
how about
not 4k, but 4u
4x4 pixels
i like to play with open apis
why is this Ramesh's profile picture
What is that
Do you know
no
Akhil might know
like
its probably like
stormlight archive
related
yes
if you go to
you will now see
some images
that are badly formatted
very
look i was like
lets do math homework
then i was like
wait i now comprehend the meaning of life
and then i was like
5 minutes
and i was like
yes
and so
my 5 minutes
resulted in images
but
not in formatting
I do all my happiness stuff after school
and then I
do work
and then I
sleep
so you are a me first
hw second
Yes
person
i see
akhil
is not
see
if I did a homework first
me second
I would never get to the me part
ikr that's what always happens with me its like
not to get all psychological
but
1.
there is more of a "guilt" to skipping an assignment to do me stuff instead of an assignment
like when i say
no we can do this tmrw
time to do me stuff
and 2.
time after homework is more "free" and ends up wasted more often
Yes
I agree
Usually in the night
I don't feel like doing stuff
with that said tho
i would like
not to be stressed in the evening
and 1 and 2 are solvable problems
so i am working towards a fully hw first, or hybrid hw/me first schedule
to properly deal with everything
no
I like how it is now
i dont
doing me stuff makes me thoroughly satisfied
so I can do work
for the rest of the day
also do you ever just tire of people
see i am never satisfied
and hope they never talk to you again
even if they will
i mean
sometimes
somewhat
how do you solve that
do you just
tell them
'no i dont wanna talk to you'
no
since that's mean and it might result in problems later
cuz usually they are very nice ppl
yes
those people who keep talking to you
are very nice ppl
i dont usually solve that issue
who dont say no
i just let it sit
who will never ever say no
yes
but instead say things
instead of no
like instead of saying
'i wont tell you'
they will say
'it is a secret'

given it's the third time
thats why u should not procrastinate kids
thing is

no of course
i mean
theres someone

Its especially fast when someone dies
yes
They switch everything so fast

Quick
Past tense
ramesh song
i like
Hmm
Welp im done with school
wdym
Im done with classes
how tho
both period 8 and 9 are not meeting?
8th lunch

that would be fun
9th no zoom
if we were in school
Michael also has 8th lunch
hi my name is fortran
and i am 4 times older than you
i remind you of AP tests
because just like Java on the AP test
you had to encode me on paper
back in the fifties
wide mitch
i make no active effort
to send these screenshots every day
they literally are just there
i am not kidding
yes
"Turn off your cameras and work"
me: time to read
i broke the news to mrs harding
that her ideas
were impossible
what ideas?
she was like yeahhhh….
at least impossible for me to do
Did she get mad
no she was like yeahhhhh...
ik
and then she was like
still
thinking
uh the second one is what every teacher does
about when i told her about password hashing
last week
wdym
no like hide it after it has already been posted
ah
and completed
like
she wants
to
do this:
Well u aint google so u cant do those
put all students in breakout rooms
that she can visit
secretly
create a test with google docs on google classroom
post the assignment
start the test
then
if ppl go over, it highlights red
and then
after everyone is done
she wants to hide the assignment from the students
so they cant click it or see it anymore
and then she can show it temporarily for students who need makeup
that is what she wants
Do this
Honestly
It is possible
Pretty sure google has a possible features thing right?
just make my own test platform
told her
she said
Where u can post ideas
already asked
Huh
Hold up
Why?
Exactly
well that would be the solution
but
Thank goの
goe
and so
it was determined
that we could not do this
also
what teacher
would use a test platform
made by
one of their
students
None
Cause we cool kids
And can haks
also
i own it
so i can just like
get in
I mean
U could make one
tbh it probably wouldnt be to hard
And give it to the IT department
you get some open source web document editor
haha those non-brains
they make all our passwords the same
and buy new dell computers
during the pandemic
Right i need to make a cool kid password generator/thingy
password generator or manager
Both
so like lastpass
Yea
But wont connect to the internet
I see
Sekurity
imagine i add 2fa to playtools
It cant be that hard
no
but iuttasdf asdfasdfasdf

asdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfas\
Fix backspace then
banb=ned o =as dhbaiow =

Rn im making me my i dont wanna do zoom script
what
Shuts off wifi, waiting 1:30 min and turns it on, 30 sec, then off again
wait
why
Makes u connected to zoom
But zoom wont work
No camera data gets sent
so there is a 1.5 minute delay
before you must come back online
Well no kinda
2 minutes
30 sec ish before zoom will close
And display a connecting window
so how come you can have it turned off for 1.5 min
Ur still in the meeting
ah
When this happens u have 1:45 ish
To get connected
i see
why is this
Otherwise it will kick u
why
u want this
Idk

cy should make a power supply

yes
no no no
Cy needs to make a power supply with its own firmware
no

cy has to write his own packet sending protocol
YES
CTP
CyDP
CyTP
Cy Transfer Protocl
CyWAN
now tell me please

why javascript

see
the problem is
you are not providing more details
*cygh
we are back at the amphitheater
cy is very excited
cy likes the amphitheater at PVP
its non-standard
and it means cy gets more fun jobs
cy now understands why certain larger websites do not use Let's Encrypt
Trust
some corporations do not want to trust modern, free, untested cert authorities
they want to stick with the old, paid, well known, and well-tested ones
if let's encrypt has a data breach
or there is some bad actor there
all user data
could be breached
Yup
without anyone knowing
a secret attack
and thus
I like the old ones
They r nice
It was super easy to install mine
idk letsencrypt is pretty easy
Without port 80
well u can do letsencrypt without port 80
how
See my home network “blocks” port 80
Idk
but how did you install ur cert
I said i had an email server on it
or validate it
So it asked me to put in the email
And it emailed the “admin”
Idk what the entire deal with it was
But namecheap just let me validate and install it on the server
yeah i mean if you go through your provider
then they will just do it
in fact
maybe GoDaddy just has ssl certs for me
On a pi
My domain registrar just gives me certs
so i dont have to deal with this letsencrypt wildcard stuff
ima check GoDaddy
Im trying to figure out a good naming scheme
Cause my hostnames and users r really random
i see
bonjour je mappelle French class
google docs
is like
14 years old
they must have started development in like 2005
like when i was born
no wonder they dont use websockets
like everyone else
websockets are only 10 years old
Wait
although apparently Microsoft had this in the 90s
just not based on Web 2.0 obviously
but of course
who could forget
May I remind you
You are born in 2004
As you are older than me
means close to
or similar to
Corellium
i see

Yeah that was my thought too

lets do it in comp sci

cause im finishing chem rn
i need to deal with expired players
every time someone opens a player on playtools a "player" document is created in MongoDB
if they leave gracefully,
the document will be erased
but if they do not
the document will not be erased
and will remain
expired
stop spying on people
in the database
the death command
ah how many players do you want to delete?
many
it deletes
everything
is everything many?
no so
delete_one
deletes the first thing that meets the criteria
deletes
delete_many
everything
deletes everything that meets the criteria
{} means anything
so essentially
it means
delete everything that is anything
DELETE FROM users ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 4;
SQL IS SCREAMING
which one?

A Chinese government media company making a video criticizing their own failures?

Ronald
use your real name
please try this
I did
I see
quite literally
and make a new share
idk if old ones work
you can see the new share dashboard
honestly bill wurtz songs are like good
they are creative and unique
youtube is like usually full of garbage
that is the reason I say this
ramesh
make a share
No
Ima sleep
gnight
The ebook is full of grammatical errors
I worry that they are employing people to pirate books in developing countries or something
It is concerning to me
hmmm
it's actually lunix
ah yes
a “illegal hacking OS"
Cy
did you literally get everyone to go to school
Then again theres culture The frog now has a mask without having to modify anything I think this is how you do it right.
cyfinfaza: the bots just broken
And subsequently fails dont just put "Checkin" scroll snapping y proximity mode a new government.
No i do not i like acrylic i guess not look i have antennas coming in the mail tmrw.
But you see I noticed a lot of attention to detail in deepin that I do not see elsewhere but you would not qualify for AP capstone i believe the ink will bleed.
Caburum: I don't get this
Bootcamp i dont want it yea you dont need Autodesk i paid $300 i think.
I identified and fixed the 18k days bug
in playtools
what was happening
was that
sometimes
the player reports "pause"
before it reports "play"
and so it starts as start:0 last:0
then when it pauses it becomes start:0 last:actualtime
then when it plays
it does not set the start time
because the last time was within 20 seconds
and then when it is done
the times are subtracted
and hence 18k days
so the solution
is to not run the pause code unless the video is actually playing
so that bug should now be fixed
huh
so marqueez is fixed?
Idk where it is now is it tho? except it is yellow round.
ah bots kinda working
nobody send any commands
cdknight: did you literally get everyone to go to school
A CO alarm i see what is sli Idk how to use discord.
And consider everything im curious and updates to last for years the people can stop the government if need be.
cmon
You can set an angle when i start to think about iphone i am less than half way through my second book *sigh.

people don't bully people in school by physically hurting them
they bully people by ignoring them
Im getting a headache from reading that
"de go out kill strength,"
"should often clean glue mosquito on metal, clean time, first cut power supply, open faceplate, use soft brush clean"
Of course dont u ever just want to de go out kill strength someone?
i think
baidu translate
would do a better job
honestly
Yea
Thats some really bad translation
Like beyond awful
this go out as save energy mosquito utensil is;

i want me a mosquito utensil
electron go out mosquitto small a night lamp
where
my site had a spasm
and generated 1700 player instances
way to fill the database
that was like 25 seconds
how
did you
do that
cy
just like how
essentially
it was like
hey server
server is like NO GO AWAY
and its like k ill reload
hey server
NO GO AWAY
k ill reload
hey server
NO GO AWAY
and it just got stuck
that being said i oughta figure out what happens if my database fills up
i only have 500MB
wait she had two wives
huh
but i have like 3 tabs of this open
tbh im surprised
1.
Cloudflare is actually letting this through
2.
its Edge that's dying not Werkzeug
diesel is garbage
Wth are you doing
sorry
devtools has died
stress testing
idk what im stress testing
but its really stressed
i forgot to join
the table
i kinda want it to fill my database
but its taking too long
so ill just directly run the generate player function
in a while loop
until death comes
how do I cargo test
cuz i need to know what happens
Meow
MERWOJRWOLIER
RAWR
I have work
due on a Friday night.
in two classes
how dare they
i have work today too
not much tho
ill do mine l8r
i wanna read a book
i wanna fill my database
ima go do that
bye
The animations on this game are just so smooth
they get all the little things right even though like the network stuff doesn't work\
to my database
slow
k but at 300 bytes per document
that's a lotta documents
100k
i finally killed it
*claps*
that took
What does it do?
Does it delete excess
Or does it not let you upload
no it just raises exceptions
but i mean
it took
1.3 million
players
Damn
i did it in about 10 minutes
but i had to like
extract exactly what i wanted to write
make 1.2 million copies of it
this is what they used for osu
and then write them
with insert_many
so
i think
i should be fine
Huh
Whats osu?
a game
ud probably like it
has to do with japanese stuff
Ehh i dont actively seek out games with japanese stuff
But i like when it comes up
Like cyberpunk
It ended up having a decent bit of japanese stuff
how is cyberpunk?
Ive been enjoying it
A lot
Maybe
haha im a google service now
what if i left it as Google Product Sans
also you cant sign into playtools
its dead
i have to delete all those players
illegal
Take the google font
Change it slightly
Bam its not illegal anymore
yes
yknow i dont actually like some of the characters
i erased all the players
no
ramesh hates
implementing crud operations
Kognise's status is a transgender flag
does that mean he is transitioning to a she
if so this makes this doubly strange
people go into the hack club community one gender and come out another
it's happened more than once
Hold on
and there is a very active LGBTQ community there
it's almost as if
something is causing them
to become gay
We cant jump to conclusions yet
or transition
etc
or
they could just be like
What if he/she/they just support them
true
but still
they actually are different
How does one “transition”
but at the same time seeing so many LGBTQ people could make them question their own sexuality
and gender
it's happened to me
so they can just get like
Do u just one day say imma be a she
and then u get a surgery
or something
Wait actually?
uh yes
and then
u start dressing like a girl
Huh
this doubt
because of so many people being gay and transgender around you
is that a thing
and then you question yourself so much
you transition
Yea
that is concerning
i get it if it's separate
Peer pressure?
yeah
Some extended family member of mine did this
i think its more of a “Delusion” of a status quo
like u join a community
where this is apparent/mainstream
no I think there are people
who are actually gay
and actually transgender
but maybe not all of them
ik
but peer pressure
not even pressure
it's more like
"there are so many"
^
Yeah
there r so many that u kinda think that its just the thing
Even if there are actually thing
yeah
im like
idk how to feel about it
honestly
if peer pressure is doing something
I thought conversion therapy is illegal
its kinda concerning
yes
hack club
if u wanna change ur gender go ahead
do it on your own
i have no problem with that
but if a community kinda makes u
thats a problem
but like i feel like the amount of things that you see about lgbtq
makes you wonder if you are yourself
so ur mind is like
skewed
its like depression in a way
everyone says they r “depressed"
but no one is actually depressed
they say that
they are depressed
to lower their expectations for their life
so when they exceed their expectations
they are happier
this is why people say "im stupid"
"im gonna fail"
"im sad"
etc
that makes sense yea
lower ur expectations
so any result exceeds them
Yep
That's what people in my grade do
honestly my grade is cursed
thats what every grade does
well
u see
i dont know anyone in my grade
so i only get to see that people
do that
its kinda apparent in my grade
i mean
theres also a flipside
ur also lowering other peoples expectations of u
yeah well
not always
they might just
inherently think ur smart
no matter what you say
the problem is I feel like there's that pressure on me
even if I literally know no one in my grade
Cause sterotypes?
like asians are smart
no
since I got
a 103 on a precalc test last year
ah
and got very high grades in that class overall
idek how u get above 100
curve + doing really well
when everyone else failed
huh
we havent had any curves this year
the thing is
but im also in cp so
yeah
well the thing is
now that they see ur smart
what they do is
they pretend you are a sharp saw in a shed
and like using you
to cut their trees
without appreciating their tool
or caring for it
so eventually the saw is going to stop working for them.
is how I like to use this analogy
I am the saw
i was about to say
thats oddly specific
it's a good analogy
right
yea
but how r they using u?
trying to
talk to me
just for the sake
ah
of repeatedly
asking me
school questions
i hate that
Mhm
I do too
it's also only girls
boys never do that
really?
Boys do it sometimes
much more rarely
and the ones that do ask for school stuff
talk to me about other things
yea
it's not like
I can't
talk to girls
it's more like for them it is out of bounds
and they refuse
becuase they only want me
for their
usage
manipulation at its greatest
tbh
this may not be 100% true
im just mad about something
and I need to rant about it
so I can get it out of my system
go ahead
like
I had another friend
where
she used me like crazy
not for school
but for programming things for her
but at the SAME TIME she also talked to me about other stuff too
and like
I thought her as a friend
hmm
wait
im just like thinking about my life
this is funny
ah its philosophy time
i like philosophy time
this is making me
regret my life decisions more
but it's fine
bruh
how tf was I supposed to know
that i would be treated this way
its a bit to early for u to start regretting decisions
eh
u dont
i already regret more than this
exactly
thats what life is
so then
ugh
I guess you learn at the same time
then what about the friend
the friend
who treats you like a friend
then all of a sudden refuses to do so
but only asks you for school help
and refuses to talk about anything else
and extend the scope of your fake "friendship"
now thats extra special
in terms of weirdness
that takes a special kind of person
but why
why would a person act so special
why
why would they suddenly decide
they want to terminate your tiny friendship
hmmm
i mean there could be many reasons
but its kinda a messed up way
what if they weren't actually
like
treating you as a friend
but rather as a person that they didn't know
and being « polite » to you
I hate that
an acquantance?
sigh
i mean
friend = acquaintance
just replace those words
I have a tendency to confuse them
well they r vastly different
not really
i mean for me
it can be blurred
a acquantance is someone i am confortable speaking to
a friend is someone i talk to often/outside a class
i mean yea it can
Yes
what if you talk to someone outside of class
thats where the lines kinda blur
i mean ive had people talk to me just for school
and i treat them as acquantances
idk
ramesh is weird
he has friendship aspirations
dont we all
I mean like I usually dont
i would just count myself lucky to have met people in elementary school
I had no friends
until high school
I mean maybe one or two from middle school
and all my middle school friends left me
i mean some have
some of my good friends “left”
or moved away
But this kinda saved me
mhm
cause most of my current friends rn ive known for 4-6 years
most of my friends rn
ive known for like
2-3
yea
im writing a poem about the saw analogy
yes
es bueno
not done yet
ueehhhaeaeaeeeaeeeeyyy
Quality resolution
this pronunciation
Okay wait lemme ask this
Does the L make a sound
no
Why
it's french
because it controls the other things
you don't say
the last thing
yeah you almost never pronounce
the last letter
Huh
of any French word
But if it was english
Would u say it
that is not an English word
it has no direct translation
i dont think
Huh
it means "home"
but like
Intresting
French has two words for "to know"
English does not have these two words
yes
conocer
there is savoir
and saber
and connaitre
aka
savoir
and connaître
Ah
English is a weird language
savoir means to know something, like a fact
yes
connaitre is like
to know a place
connaitre means to know something like a person, or a concept
or like to like know a person
intimacy maybe
yes
that might be the word
but you see cy
it is a more "intimate" know
akhil already knows this
Like conocer
since he knows what conocer and saber are
Yea
in spanish
yes i would assume
pronounce
ca ẽ
nasal e
pronounced like
aw
but nasal
and the a is like a in father or cat idk
i think it's the former
its not can
its con
unless this is spanish where caen means they fall
this is a French city
for French hw
veey idayahl
oeil
Isnt that caída?
pronounce
u eel
like french u
wait

dont ask
this question
what
is this
question
this webassign has stuff on it
that was not in the notes
ahhh
the notorious webassigns
most of them r fine
but this one
is not
this webassign
which one r u doing
is the first one
where i get a question
wrong
um
huh
the one due today
is it 6.5?
6.2
i have tong so mine are already done
ah
people said that one was bad
it was ez for us
most of the questions were trivial
but there were like 3
that were just not
in the notes
I'm almost done with my physics homework
this is fun
only took 1½ hours
fisiks
do you have to take a study hall to take fisiks
네
are you tho
no
you do
for ap fiskisk
fisiks
huh
u have to take a study hall?
ugh
so you only take one elective ramesh
yes
which is
APUSH
ah
right
ugh idk what electives i wanna do next year
i finished Career i think
im doing
i gotta do animation
ap psych and ap econ next year
and im doing 2 art electoves this year
i wanna do ap econ
and AP Research
i have art and career
i also have to do financial lit
what were the other elective requirements?
thats it besides financial lit right
this tho
im doing it over the summer
stop
stop
pls
what is it
i need to answer it
and idk it
do scientific
2.55*10^7
dont ever make them decimals like that
why tho
cause its easier
but what is the answer
and our webassigns only accept em like that
how do you solve it
ah this one
u need to do a couple of equations
ur given joules
i did the energy to wavelength one
yea so find out wavelength that would produce that amount of joules
but then what
cuz i did that
thats the answer
in meters
but then
why
doesn't it work
calculate frequency first then
and calculate wavelength from that to check
wait i might have typed something wrong
also make sure u used plancks constant correctly
6.626e-34
*sad
i has
dyslexic
i read
6.26
instead of 6.626
nice one chief
and 7.36
instead of 7.63
nice one
i still got a question wrong tho for the first time
since like september
*cough
i get one wrong every time
not this question
this one
metal frequency wavelength
a lot of people got that one wrong
yeah it must have been
even tho it can legit be simplified
to just metal and frequency
hi i have grades
or even just metal and intensity
good job
i have a B in english
why
lets see
ah its cuz im not that good at english
i am not as well
hi im genesis
i tell you ppls student ids
in the url bar
and hence access to everything they own
yup
Cy William Westbrook
u r correct
yes
CWW
my name is shorter
Cy
then ur initials
dang
than
imagine having a middle name
fix you're grammer
no i shalln't
wait
you have a
middle name
did you not know this
ramesh's attention
gets piqued
by middle names
no I did not
i mean u told me i think once
My parents were like
what if he doesn't like being Cy
Hi my name is Bill
hi
i has grades
Thank u
I was about to be pissed
you get to see any one grade
but only one
Gym
really akhil
haha
Thats all that matters
its like the fiji water
you see one
remember that
you choose wisely
Hmm?
you get one free item from the vending machine
and akhil chooses
That was great
the fiji water
mentos
no he choose mentos
no the fiji water
the most expensive
most useless
thing
I chose fiji water
what does cy choose
no i did not choose
this was
I gave it to cy i think
real
no it wasn't
no
you give it to cy
you kept it
i didnt
no
well
im discarding akhil's request
unless
U also got a free one
cy also chooses fiji
no
i choose
like
idk lemme look at them
He chooses lemonade
I usually get a snapple
yes
i would choose lemonade
And one time someone forgot to end the card transaction
so what is lemonade
*remembering time before covid...
Minute maid lemonade
yes
no what does it translate to
So i chose the most expensive
on the table
Fiji water
Akhil stole someone's money
That was the best water i ever drank
No no no
wait
you bought the fiji
I did not steal
with someone else's money
HILARIOUS
no so essentially
They forgot
the machine
like
stealing
if you dont click
ik
"end transaction"
and you walk away
the next person
can just click something
and it will just buy it
So i didnt know
So i apple payed it
on the last person's card
no so you did
But the payment never actually went through
cuz you tole me
No we found out after didnt we?
i found out from you
that you knew
I found after
I think
*sigh
it was not as bad as the cortana incident
That
Was
The
Best
Damn
Thing
I
Ever
Did
Oh
it was
i dont remember it
but
i know it
Cy had set Cortana to some button
why do my friends like to trick me
OH it was his pen
so i stole the pen from him and kept activating cortana
and he didnt know wtf was happening
yeah
and he like
thought his computer was problematic
and was enjoying it
i did what cy does
up to the point
he realized
akhil took his pen
i think i was dropping hints
and he still didnt figure out
till i made it blantaly obvious
yes
cy is mildly
gullible
but also
he doesn't care
he may not
but u gotta admit
that was so funny
it was
frankly though
ah the things that i did last year
it was also somewhat defeating
because
ik
i will never be able to trick anyone
like that
i dont even know how i got the pen
you um
opened
my pencil case
cause u like keep watch of it
and took it
ah
so it was my skills of theft
i see
i oughta trick ona you
whilst you are not paying attention
please do
i did it to calum once
it was the simplest thing
at the 4H fair
he was annoying me
so when he went to sit down
in his chair
i removed
the chair
and he fell
to the ground
ungracefully
ah
the classic
it takes a decent bit of skill tho
yes
it does
cause they cant notice the chair is pulled
no you do it at the very last moment
u gotta do it while they are about to sit
james remembers
another funny moment
at 4h
so like
james
has 2 straws
for his bubble tea
and they are attached
and so this little girl comes over
and sees the straw
and shes like
"that's a really long straw"
and her dad is like
"well you dont hear that from girls really often do you?"
HAHA
it was the funniest thing
literally
the little girl is like
so lost
thats great
that dad is a chad
i see
ramesh is here
wait
that is
an innuendous thing to say
…
and it's a little girl too so it's more sketchy
… how to make of this je ne sais pas
ever stop to think,

what
I wanna transcribe a book
wdym
Hi
Ig transcribe aint the word
please
But i wanna copy a book
why
Like pen and paper
And just copy it
Idk seems fun
you do you
contact telegram
and ask them
why their bot api isnt working
matrix을 조용해 줘
Cmon u stupid bot
this is supposed to happen
why bottle
use
gunicornm
Why dont we just make a copy of the bot
i can just make a copy of the bot frankly
Like it doesnt need all the features
Just translate
actually
For when the actual one doesnt work
that might be a good idea
hold on
네 전 이런 생각은 있어
hold on
Should i make a tg bot in rust?
hold on just a moment here
i almost have it
almost
just gotta copy the code
wait
actually
wait
네
yes
And its yours pirating books is bad for the economy i think it wouldnt be air.
For $800 wine yes unlike powerpoint and vlc.
so somehow
I dont wanna add a timer and get really mad it doesn't really cost anything i think even one year can make a difference.
It has been spoken of too many times to house their 2700 metric tons of ammonium nitrate its all open and available a CO alarm.
heh
so now
SERVER BLOW UP HOUSE TIME
definately not cy is taking messages
and not cy
is responding
hi
i know what im doing
cyfinfaza: i know what im doing
nice
….
um
what
THE HELL IS THIS
…..
NO
STOP
NO
um
so
/
/
s/
s/

휘파람
please force telegram
to stop
doing this
to me
use matrix
ill try writing a bot in rust that does bare minimum translate for the backup
it must be one of the settings of the bot
u try getting the normal one to work
you dont understand
its not my bot
but this doesnnt happen to all bots
my bot listens for post requests
and then
Create A Poll
it stops
recieving post requests
go dm the bot
and it works
try using
rust
it
is no
t
my code
why
why
why
why
why
what did i do wrong
Idk
Something is wrong tho
maybe its my bot
Idk ill try making one tmrw in rust
Seems not to hard
too
not too hard
that is
I typed that
until
it just
doesnt
work
Idk why it autocorrected
what if i switch to flask
No
why did you use bottle
lets see
Thats overkill
idk some tutorial
bottle sounds dumb
im trying
a crate on rust
Telegram-bot is a crate right?
"telegram-client"
Yup
making a bot rn
k
hopefully it works for more than 3 seconds
the thing is this
if i just create a new "bot"
with botfather
it just works again
and then it doesnt
yes
but i didn't restart my code or anything
they are literally using threads
in a hecking
telegram bot code thing
this is stupid
garbage boilerplate idk
k nvm
im dumb
"Compiling"
can this literally compile faster
i have
a very expensive cpu
yes
i know
and I want my code to compile in seconds
not
Cant u tell it to use more threads?
i use python
long
we dont compile
i think it just like uses
max threads
Really?
I thought it just uses a default
Like 4
uses goddamn
shared libs
stupid
Damn
stupid
Nice tmux bar
shut up
bully
Its a nice color tho
still
The bars just ugly
its Wrabel
ramesh is being an idiot
ive been wolling the wrong stuff
unsurprising
i was like lets watch the news today
maybe we get something new
Good music
blu ray face
ah
cy
ima listen to that one
can see what im listening to rn
which song
Idk i like the entire album
i see
U prob wont
Cause its pop/rock/heavy metal
no i remember that album
from 5th grade
Ah then ur fine
Is good music
it is good
i didn't like it much at the time
but also
i didn't like anything
at the time
^_^
i really wanna see Ramesh's bot
and if it works
this library
compiles
slower than the linux kernel
wasnt that their like one hit
in 2015
that like pushed them
into relevance
Um
ramesh knows no songs
Blurryface?
yeah
Idk i like their old music as well
have you heard of OK GO
Nope
hold on
yes
heard that
like the first song
Es bueno
one of the best music videos
along with most of the rest of theirs
i think my physics teacher shared an okgo video
entire thing shot on a drone at half speed
in one take
not multiple clips
no have not heard that
I like the band
Oh no
Not monogatari
why
it's
catchy
Is it?
listen to it
some "boy bands"
but they are good
oh and of course
cant forget
there was this girl in drama club
absolutely obsessed
with 5sos
girls are obsessed with music
there
i made a perfect generalization
Ah
yes
males
Them
yes
them
ta men
他们 means them in chinese
i suppose
you have not heard
of the songs
i
post
not i the latter ones you did
who could forget
Ah
Odd Chap
Its not bad
Its kinda jumpy
I only like the beginning
i like this spotify background
Yes
Only 146k
its Haywyre
makes some of the better remixes
these
Yes
caravan palace
akhil
idk
this arabic song
is from the nokia ringtone
Hmm?
Is it?
I cant listen rn cause i dont have headphones near by
wait
youtube
just
became
a PWA
it wasnt before
Leave it to alphabet
akhil
listen to the arabic song
ramesh
I dont have headphones
make your bot
Ill listen first thing tmrw
hi im line us
blast
it
make it
it is compililng
i wanna see
what
for cgods sake
how long
does it take
to compile
it is running
add it
i can compile the entirety of Mbed os
faster than this
wait i need to make the bot respond
yes
you do
ima switch libraries
this one is bad
its linus
and ramesh
ah conro
that canadian
for gods sake this is an async
sad
working for Monstercat
PlayTools can be run serverless
i think ima run it serverless
how
on some provider
wdym
that provider
is a server
FYI
yes
but serverless in the sense
that i dont pay for
or manage
a server
so its cheaper
and easier
and maybe faster
in fact
if i wrote the whole thing in javascript
I could run it directly on Cloudflare's edge network
with Workers
for maximum speed
but it relies on the DB
which is slow
so it wouldnt make much of a difference
although maybe if i could offload the player client api to cloudflare
or i could host with pythonanywhere
but that costs moneys
or Heroku
or Google AppEngine
also its WSGI so like
yes its a server
but it is shared
it just calls my WSGI app
pythonanywhere was nice
but they wont let me add a custom domain
so no
^^ free
depedency hell
Rust
what is it with girls and an obsession with celebrities
cant they be obsessed with people in their school instead
like normal people
so you want
girls
to be obsessed
with you
but
they a
re
not
too busy
obssesed
interesting
with celebrities
Hmm
did I ever say « me » anywhere
i am making inferences
well
i never said such an thing
hence
no inference should be made
this may be useful
using cloud service providers
for pub/sub / websockets stuff
and like real-time
cuz they do all the management
and the load balancing
and all that
this is what companies like vultr do not give
they do not have such services available

Heres the thing i can make more elaborate purchasing schemes Uhm its gon look cool.
or anything but windows 8
so all you have to do is connect a mac
but its a foretaste
or clogged
Prior to our pickup
because
TTYTh
but among these things i look at
I have a question
and changing
i did
i think it does that
i will send one later
in the way that if you have your phone you can just get them to work even if they're not charged
and
um
ok so what if only u pirate somthing
its being a bad
that have no alternate functions
i find it very distrating and disruptive
what have you found
lol
except now
i think we are dead
Or you buy one
not me
You just shift your hands on the keyboard
my house doesn't have ethernet
nope
Why
did I write
a romance novel
for 138 pages
nope
dead
again
HomeWork
no rn its doing weird flask stuff
I told my parents it was in Brooklyn
censorship is bad
and they were literally on my street
i know your path
mine doesn't run
if i bought it from you
no dont do it now
acting like I was some criminal
No the theme
I send a link
my grandparents apartment has many of those
i may write my first article as a poem
Well what is moving on the screen
hold on
i should get another monitor
its some child account
cool then that's fine
a paraprosdokian
and I didnt have much time to work on this stuff
and for $49
so idk if it even goes to me
well i never really planned to
Then give the website a nice icon
*weep
I can never get Linux to work for me
that's not a UI font
i think its just a coincidence though
what u wanna giv to me?
i tried already
you dont know
But typing is fast
I will test it when I get home
Then don't worry
I cannot at the moment
lemme do that
i came up with the path /beluga/passion
and unlike hackathons
if you have enough ram
No
i am unable to find what you search

I am
Asking for your support
no i already paid you
2 thousand dollars
now go win an election
you dont need my help anymore
aw
ah
i should be able to make a share
that should be a thing
really easily
the problem is
you need
to be
logged in
make the bot
associate my username
with my apikey
you dont have an apikey tho
i would have to make an api
you could like
mbed
the bot in the
flask app
i mean
i could also just like
add an api
have fun
that is a nightmare
or is it
all it needs to do
is export a session key
so you make a page
to get an api key
or a
"session" key
then pass it to the bot
actually
this might be a fun idea
the only issue
is it requires
the bot
to remember
things
i was reading a book last night
it made me start sobbing
i see
literalyl
alternatively
the bot could make
"public shares"
that everyone can view
in fact any time it finds a YouTube link
it could automatically spit out a playtools link
but that would just start taking unneccesary space in my db
so probably no
what would it even do tho
just like
like you do
i know
what it could do
the bot
has an account
and
it can spit out data
hi i just made
an api
im sure ramesh
is happy to hear
and now
i can implement it
APIs are bad
hard to write
i just wrote it
its very simple
show kode
its almost no code
i want see
cuz its just the original code
wdym
show code
api code
yes
the route handler
function
it uses
the same
handlers
as the non-api
except
for the sign in
which uses a different handler
essentially
when you sign in
how many lines of repeated code
um
lemme count
this is all a repeat of the signin function
but that's it
oh fine
it relies on the "api" flag set by this function
in your session cookie
so when you ask it for data
it knows whether to respond in plain text
or in html
what about
json
well
json
but
essentially
text
i mean
yea
json
actually
it is not json yet
i just used the str() method
i will use the json method
haha yes this is working
you should like
implement bot tokens
i could
but
it's a lot of work
yes
it is
and
its not worth it
if you wanna embed video view data into chatbots
and have a UI
they can just make their own accounts
so what you do
with zero lines of js
yes
vanilla
css
not
javascript
and jquery
and all that
yes zero lines
of js
zero
but I will add turbolinks
has some js now
you should add turbolinks
for an animation
look at the animation
yes
j'ai vu
i like that animation
its nice
i just made it a function
mhm
so i can apply it to any element
typeAnimate(<elementID>, time)
yes
that is similar
but the other implementation
where it repeats
this is just a simple animation
once
kode

why twice
i suppose
it now

That is cross chat app
wdym
so i can make bots
that work on all platforms
what
is this madness
oh its for those like
chatbots on websites
Idk
Also
Like
If you write a matrix bot
yes
...
It can be bridged
To like other platforms
yknow i could also
just
write in python
a bot
that
works on all the platforms
i can think of some way
to make that work
i am going to go to sleep
I as well

Paste a valid YouTube link to create an in-group PlayTools share.
you can now implement the PlayTools API
there are no docs
but
there is
this screenshot
which sums it all up
web dev is boring
for me
you should write a rust library to implement playtools
and so they focus wholly on that image
but in my opinion its good enough
broak
Huh
Guess i broak it
Somehow
croak
Im the one who break this
Me speaking breaks this bot somehow
*sigh
i think its someone's username
it messes it up
the one with the foreign characters
Me and ramesh both have foreign characters
i see
then idk
its telegram
they stop
sending me
things
ima eat foods
bye
i think it works fine
fror me
asdf
hi
hi
Thing is this
I can just make more bots
Link them to my backend
And they work
For a short time
And the they die
Like not even restart it
Make a bot
To make bots
Here do this
Make a bot
And set privacy off
And set
Webhook
And you will see
A functional bot
I'm going to use this
ah is it still broaken
Do this
Tell me once you did
i kinda cant do that rn
Why
im more focused on the router
Ah
Is optimum there
i dont need them to come just yet
Have you found any leads
To this issue
nope
not a clue
Did you try connecting directly
yea
i didnt work
Um
Does your router have
Wait
It may have a serial terminal
Or an ssh terminal
thats what i was thinking
or ssh
or telnet
i tried them
Yeah
i could not connect
Can you send a pic of the device
but it was refusal
so mabye
i just got the credentials wrong
Like all the ports on the back
the ports?
Just a picture of it
So I can see
yea i will when i go downstairs
K
rn im doing support
K
ok this support person is super annoying
i think i stumped them
cause they asked what i would like changed in the settings
which is not what i asked for
Hold up
wait akhil
do i have to ask them every time i want things to be changed?
i dont think so
but
i need to buy a monitor
today
what one
do i get
okay
i have a lenovo one
i think its amazing
how are the colors
are they accurate
how are the blacks
how much price
what model
hmm idk what to compare to
r they accurate compared to my retina display
no
i mean i have my dell SE2419H
and its really nice
but the colors
and the blacks
are not
mine was on sale
for like 100 something
when its msrp was 200 something
i mean im thinking of getting some dell ultrasharp
i want like 1440p
i like dell stuff
u can find mine on their website'
it usually is not garbage
yea mine 2560x1440p
70hz
i see
i like mine cause it has a USB-C hub
so it connects to my mac with usb c
Yeah I don't need that
charges it
At all
It's going on a desktop
and has 2 usb ports
yea then dont get this one
cause USB C is the reason i got it
There is only one u should get
Apple pro max pro ultra XDR Display with Saphire + Stand
YES
Sold
Done
tbf
it has supposedly some of the best color
accuracy
Im dying rn
this support person is annoying
and my ankle is dyin
I would try finding a LG one
Or Samsung
Those r pretty nice
K lemme see
U can prob find some for like 150$
U should have bought one during black friday
Amazon and best buy had so many monitor deals
Imma get some 1440p
From Dell LG or Samsung
1440p is nice
On a mac its garbage
I dislike macs resolution
Its so weird
So when u attach a standard monitor
It becomes le fuzzy
I see
Ok support lady is useless
Time to old school it
Turn it off and on again
The ports u wanted
U prob cant see them that well
There are
No
Ports
Literally what is this
Cause things r connected
But yea theres no usb and stuff
It's like just
4 ethernet, 2 phone, coax, 2 power and a reset switch
Hmm
U have like two extra usb
Any buttons?
Reset and wps
Try holding wps while booting
Or resetting it
That way you can gain access
Yea imma do this first
K
But later
Cause im playing on my xbox
And need wifi
K
I ate one of my Apple products
Oh no

for like
it hasn't broken for me
at all
no but remember
mine worked
for like
a few months
yes
no issue
then
they might have cancelled you
it died
actually
can I make another bot
it died
right
when
with me
you sent
some weird
message
in that weird script
yes
maybe
your account is tainted
or something
but like
if i make a new bot
right now
it will work
ramesh
make a bot
and then it will die
right now
and then
set the webhook
to my bot
what webhook
there are no webhooks
what
are you using
wdym
the telegram bot api uses webhooks
at least it can
and that's the mode im using
also you have to set privacy off
i
dont
use webhooks
at all
maybe that's why mine works
what does your bot use
like
the api
the telegram api
how does that work tho
polling?
websockets?
polling probably
it works though
like
i never use web services
ramesh
make a bot
someone other than me
make a bot
please
I did
please
try
using this library
port your bot to it
how do i use your bot
it is down
make it up
it doesn't do anything
make it up all the time
make it respond to like
no
hi
see
k fine
k now
lets see
if this remains working
also
you can just make a bot
and link it to my webhook
and everything will work
l8r
make a bot
and link it to my webhook
I am sleeping
*sigh
ohayō
can you try destroying my bot cy
crashed bot
bot is dead?
hmm
always crashing
is it actually tho
100% of the time
a
yep
it is dead
restart
it
as a doornail
nope
i am restarting it
/
r/
/
r
it wont start cy
ramesh
why
wont it start
i dont get this
i can just like
make a bot
and it will work
in this group
maybe it needs admin
hol on
/
.s
my bot
will not
work
why
why
why
ramesh
i made a new group
oh right
cy
go to the other chat
except the one that works
you mean yours
tyes
and like
the other clone of your bot
so both mine
no
the like
this
this
add definitely not cy ii
and give access to message
s
hi
what is this literal horse crap
stop using webhooks
whats weird is this
i get like
every 5-60 seconds
some message with
a slash
and it invokes an error
normally
its not that
hmm
also
it doenst just like
come in
with every message
wait I have an idea
or even every /
wait
remove the handlers
wdym
just make it return no response
it has to process the incoming messages
without throwing errors
like the issue is
oh you mean
telegram will keep spamming bad messages
telegram
and then the bot will get confused
doesn't accept error 500
even if the message
has passed
yes
make it return something else
k hold on
message
nope
its not
coming in
telegram will not send
anything
to my bot
WAIT
no
wait
wait
its coming in
all the messages
see now
im getting a flood
of messages
see
see
hi ramesh
Aktchulee
I see
are for YouTube ad placement
that does not force me to agree with them
i found this
No
I think so too
If it was the second
cdknight: no
cdknight: k fine
that is interesting
its literally a laptop
even though my dad said he would pay half price
he will likely be more lost than you
i have to wait till like next year
she described it as as if a hurricane had come through
i guess
sorry $700
cy did you disable error 500
bc the software i was using required Nvidia CUDA
no
cdknight: this
i just
um
no stop
well idk but often installing software becomes very weird
i need more friends to talk to
Cool
yes you can
and now its cheese
cdknight: see
hi
cdknight: hi
but in the end its not all that much money
hey ramesh
yeah im right i checked
thats too expensive
you should figure out how to run linux on a surface RT
okay
i had to like
 run ethernet through the walls
 to get to the furnace room
 but like coincidentally
 the router is right on the other side of the wall
 and coincidentally
 there is a hole
 in the wall
 just big enough for 2 ethernet cables
 so i ran
 the 2 ethernet cables
 and now
 it is on ethernet
see now it will work for a short time
yes

it may be
that if a chat group

코로나비르스

and no
no one
will be
at the beach
is this
its the middle
a private beach
no
its like
the boardwalk
in the middle of winter
do you genuinely think anyone will be there
tbh idk why my parents wanna drive like 2 hrs to get to LBI
just to
walk
by the beach
in the winter time
but that is what i will be doing tmrw
i will be in the car for 4 hours
yes
that
this is awful
needs
to go
it needs
to be better
should i
make you
something
a web ui
if you want
I was thinking of making it myself but like
I hate
web dev
cy likes web dev
he could even
make them
well in that case
I have one requirement
0 lines of JS
i mean
so no animations
you can use css
for animations
i can get around
with very little
js
no
zero js
that is your challenge
zero lines of js
i have done it
most of my stuff
doesn't use js
I want none of this to use JS
for the appearance
obviously i need it
for chat
actually
and radio
make it functional without js
but
it can work with js
so like
if you disable js
it still appears
that's what PlayTools does
it loads in
but
if js works
then
it will instantly remove the title
like this
and redo it
gimme your current code
where is it
in github
here
uh
it is a bit
annoying to run
but
wait
you need to literally install
redis
mysql
and then like
what is redis
idk
like
a runtime cache thing
why do you need
all this
Look
complexity
idk
it was a mistake
Mr. I Dont Do JS
there is an issue
what is celery
something you dont need
for like
tasks
background tasks
i could make like
imagine not knowing how to run a thread
it is harder than you think
to
deal with image processing
with gifs
and then you realize it takes
an inordinate amount of time
to resize gifs
just use one of google's hundred or so tools
no
im sure
theres like
I don't
use google tools
some image management tool
and cloud services
but its more scalable
idc
how do i run the app
it is
painful to set up
can i just rewrite it
ill just write enough of it to make it appear
no
you cannot rewrite it
why
I spent time on this project so I do not want my project to get thrown out
It would hurt my ego
no like just enough flask to make it appear
so i can make the ui
oh
let me help you
run it
go to your wsl
and then
clone it
and then
follow the prompts
then
then
go to the directory
um
for the repo
i dont think
wsl
can run servers
why
in the background
it's not in the backgorund
i can try
it is a flask dev server
lets see
put this in
.flaskenv
make a new venv
then flask run
oh
then in another window
you need to go to the repo
hold on i just cloned it
lemme start at the beginning
in emotes
then
what is celery
like a job runner
i see
im installing stuff
hi ramesh
its not working
also
linode
ah
oh
linode
"i cant operate"
wt
nice excuse
wsl2 is a thing for a reason
and it can do guis
hi i dont feel like this
give me windows instructions
wait
its working
hold on im about to have things working
i almost have it running
although pip3 appears to be dying
abuncha red appeared on my screen
show
well flask ran
so
this happened tho
cd..
cd ..
cygh
just like
EMOTES_TWITCH_CLIENT_ID=
add this to flaskenv
blank
and then restart everything?
yes
did you
install redis
and start it
i didn't start it
also
explain to me
how on earth
i have another server on port 5000
different ip
start it
try again
but
localhost
leads to emotes
idk
it like
does weird stuff then
how do i start redis
same way you did for mysql
sudo service redis-server start
k i think
everything
hold on
hi ramesh
this is
beautiful
did you celery
yes
restart your flask
and it was only yellow
the resize function broke probably
you have to obliterate the database
actually
theres
an error
oh
i hate this
right
you need to
install git-lfs
and then run like
git lfs pull
in the directory?
yes
in emotes
restart flask?
hi ramesh
it still
doesn't work
what
oh
this you have to go into the database
just like
wait
should i stop flask
yes
and celery
k now
start?
yes
start celery first
wait i started flask first
meh
should i re erase
doesnt matter
no
and recreate
not work
cygh
how
can you just like
live share
so I can fix this
wdym
live share
share what
has
a terminal
that I can access
and you can watch me fix it
you mean in vscode
yes
um
ok
i has made
a share
k wait
go into some file when you are in
that way i know
btw
the flask
is running rn
i should stop it
right
no
this is kinda hard
as you can see
ramesh i have another wsl session
running flask
and celery
yes
get rid of it
k
oh ik why
wait
can you access
the server
vscode crashed
yes
you left
there
it works now
mostly
I see
it's stupid
yes
it is
but
it works now
i left
im working on a migration
how do i stop tmux
uhm
idk
like control d
twice
k yeah it works now
so now i can make a nicer ui
kewl
should it use
Lexend
idc
also like
follow the program structure
wdym
app/routes/ui
for UI routes
templates/ui for UI templates
ima just edit
the homepage
that's all
okay
there is
ramesh
what
this already uses
js
yes
remove it
well then no preview
k fine
keep it
actually
i can make a preview
with only css
you could link it
to another page
when they click
no when you hover
it like
pops up
Fine
sure
I would do this
but you do you
so much better
already
what happened to light mode
gone
make it dynamic
later
no
it will
remain
dark
or else
glow
doesn't work
well
cygh
ill just add it later
k
1gXZ_h2Vy33FUIZgG3pbJfd5Lv81TDSnd2AfS-o7QZrCWueC68On0C5c_ERywoBsLUVV9dXTUVVadDImJ__6pdMPa4VCJr-Yorh8Fkts-29y9ypwvb4yVkTxq5wxEX_DoNrhm91Ct0K4Wv7AwRT0Hqy76t83AD37aGv5Y30t0ek
random api key
I
hashed all the API keys
and they are no longer stored in plaintext
cy is having fun
the icons
now
pulse
the glow
pulses
interesting
you may have to git pull or else the PR will fail
also tho
it relies on cy2 basicstyle.css
also i have no clue how to use git correctly
that is a big problem
ik i can do git pull
to update
this may also be an issue
then git commit
actually
nah
it's fine
the thing is
that file is
unstable
so you may wanna download it
are you pulling it
from a remote server
and host it yourself
just
yes
put it
in the
hcking
app/static/style
wait i need to make sure it works in firefox
yes
it does
okay
k i made it be in the local directory
how do i use git
tell me
first
then
did that work
what does it say
um
did you fork it
i did
what you
said
oh
oops
okay then
fork it
how
tell me
git fork?
press the fork button
in github
fork
wait
why fork it
fork
you have to
fork it
to PR
hmm
ok
ok...
now what
you
git push origin master
remote origin already exists
sigh
wait
git remote remove origin
then
then this
Everything up to date.
oh cygh
wait

then
k then what
oh wait
ok
k now
i did all that

the compare tab
you have to like
choose yours
what is mine
um
i think urs is just master
um
but
it says
choose different ones
as if
they are the same
the two up there
wait

that was the original
js
s
download stuff
what
yes nice pulse glowy icons me like
I am now

Thank you cy
This looks
not like an issue now
the only thing is
the cursor is not pointer
when you hover over the icons
Yes
You can PR and fix that if you want
no
i will not
do this
all
again
I mean
you know how to do it now
right
you can just add
cursor: pointer
fine
not now
you should tell james
that the icons

I did
what did he say
Diskord
Gn
gn
i should do hw
Cy is typing
The beach in the winter
so like no one
intéressant
I finally got to my servers
time to initiate backup
either that
or the server isn't booting
so it has ssh functionality
idk what the credentials are tho
metasploit tiem
cy mind running ip -c a on ur rpi
i kinda messed up my wpa_supplicant.conf on it
and idk what the default is
and send it
k one moment
gracias
what about that machine id
its just
i wanted to see how different systems do it
why
what is this
its like weird
u should look up how its generated
and python
and one is magenta
It's gonna be like 250
and it will also be secured
and i plan to wait
i wanna do split digital audio AI
it work?
yes
hola
HA
and right before your eyes
it dyes
..........
i am both very dissapointed
and dying of laughter at the same time
akhil
go to the other
chat
i broke
it
on
the
dms
conspiracy
akhil
is the death
of all bots
mabye i just wont ask the bot
people will have to ask for me
perhaps
wait
yeah I mean
well
cuz
when I dm it
it works
fine
do raspberry pis use cgroups
idk
/proc/self/cgroup
does it have something
after the first line
like whats the first line
that tells what cgroups it uses
arch has cgroups
ur supposed to cat it
its a file
hmm
interesting
so only arch has that
since it was on the bottom handle
anyway i dont need a new phone right now
I see no confetti
1gb is not much
CARRIAGE RETURN
Also I dont like the font
i am not COVID-19 research
YES
he understands japanese
i fixed
it
i figured out the problem
hook up an si7021
I do not have a passport
bc i didn't know what to do
the problem was this
you would send a message
python would throw an error
and so the WSGI server would return an error 500
and then
telegram would be like
oh
you didn't acknowledge my message
ill send it again
and then
it would crash again
and the cycle would repeat
until a certain number of tries was exceeded
so now
if the code fails
it just
still returns
200 OK
*sigh
So
he had to go to hospital
what would  be interesting is to run android apps through chrome
i am awaiting my mom's completion of my school forms
Hola
then what
but honestly for applications that small
i utilize obs
the code that does airtable?
Nice
see you are a literal virus
but now
it doesn't die
when viruses like you
send messages
to the server
wait
try
something
other than hola
おはよう
hmm
Not as much
Calum did
おはよう
cyfinfaza: Good morning
idk
at least
it doesn't break now
eating food
bye

I guess i am
bc my desktop does not accept mic signal from my earbuds
thats like the only thing i can say i would buy
anyway maybe ill do ionic
I have multiple Cortex M4 dev boards
i am also an e-reader
what if |
are they in telecom or pharma
I see
why
and you have had robots.txt issues with cloudflare
Or fusion 360 through wine
think about it
youre putting too much emphasis in
you want switches
so if u have questchin
cy is going to do some PCB design
ther
gud
Adios
Ugh
yup
nope
Why
i will identify that issue
another time
i will eat
now
bye
Must my life be like this

I gave up on english and just turned it in
She cant blame me
i suppose
akhil

see if the bot dies
ah youre on mobile tho
Whats command?
no command
just paste link
ah yes
it needs to be
youtube desktop
not mobile
lemme go find the linl
it needs to have the watch?v=
No data yet.
akhil click the thing to get data
No data yet.

i could read
but i havent yet
Nice one
take a look
huh
its like

Huh
Thats cause i dont
Have

or alternatively
i could just
add a condition
for that
Wait
面白い
akhilvanka: interesting
I
Did
It
I
Can
Fricken
Translate
shoot
my database
my page just refreshed
5 thousand times
bugs
i hate bugs
now is not the time to fix those bugs
now is the time
to become
interested
in capitol punishment
and its merits
and downfalls
and the varying opinions
of various credible
peer-reviewed
sources
Yes
wait akhil
did you see
it has a new front page
Oo fancy
My design
i designed
i am now a collaborator
on the github
they pulsate
they glow
Nice
I should do something to become collaborator
They so blurry
they are meant for discord
to be inline
Ah makes sense
you know what i like about windows
just
you are more a software type
i dont let it steep for long enough
Do
I need ramesh to make me a token for it
brew tea
They test things for safety
or asian
well what would be an equivalent amd
safety
or asian
one or the other
try this for your validation key
later
this is where it was the whole time
I'ma ask the gearbest people
see heres a problem
if i stay here any longer i will not sleep and i will fail at honors english
like if there is even 1 cm of water
ramesh where to get firmware
my relatives
Or 15 fps on mid color depth
hahaha
one has to die
its gonna be 15 fps on mid color depth
or my relatives
I could set up distributed data collection with them
This is another one
cuz i dont think chrome is made with .net
if I buy it as a student
it looks ugly
woba woba woba woba
heres a question
what if we made like
our own
messaging platform
that worked in the cli
like properly
like a cli messenger
Hmmm
That would be cool
also like
if its our own platform
it can be anything
and we dont have to worry
about anything
like it becoming subscription
or privacy
or any of that
Thats true
That would be a cool idea
i see
Where would we store all the messages?
on a server
Cloud?
yeah
well it has to be cloud
or else
its bad
Yea
Time to see how to make a messaging protocol
WebSockets
or actually
something like MQTT
like nochat
but obviously with more features
hmm
i will be looking into this
emotes?
you want?
i give
Yes
I'm a Teapot
im going to leave
i am going
to
become a MERN dev
ooo
fancy
ramesh
is mad
without being here
?
he does not like
MERN
devs
well MERN are what, Mongo, and Fancy JS right?
Mongo ExpressJS React Nsomething
maybe nginx
node
right?
yeah
see im not sure if I want all of it
on a more specific note
is a thing
im sure you are aware
of course
react is nice
its supposed to be difficult or something
but I examined the result
of the little example programs
and I liked
what I saw
so I wanna learn that
and it might
send me into MERN space
cuz like
idk
i had pe
she was like
you need to have all your workouts done
and i was like
wait
i thought
we were just coming up with them for wednesday
and shes like
no
you have to do them all
by wednesday
huh
you must be like
why does cy like this
yes and no
i usually try to never question the things u send
i see
but if you look in the image
but i cant help but siliently judge them
you see react
is by default
doing the right thing
and letting the app take up the top space
also
the buttons
are not some crap
they are good buttons
i have no problem using a safearea
if my app will look good
also its cross platform
which is what i need
so essentially
its better
than the other stuff
Xamarin was garbage
Flutter was ugly
Ionic is slow
this appears good
if you get what i mean
it has been good
ive been using it for some smal things
and its nice
its just kinda annoying to set up
ima gota khem
bye
why i cant access the settings
cause one, I can only edit the settings through optimum
and second
optimums router management thingy is down
ah
so i gotta wait till they fix the dang thing
ima finish watching the planning thing
?
ur supposed to watch
the vidoe
Yea imma watch it later
imma watch it now
to get it out of the way
Um
U got more ram didnt u
they were gone
Why r u still bottoming it out?
and then
they came back
Ah okay
yeah im not out rn
oh just streaming video
over WebSockets
to the folks out there
on optimum
you might wanna
switch
to
replit
Uh what
What
WHAT
Can i install openvpn on it
i really wanted to
but why would that help you
U prob can
I mean
you still have to tunnel through optimum
Ik
It speed tho
your speed would be limited by optimum
I get 300 from optimum
So i would be fine
i wanted OpenVPN on it tho so i could have shared networks
with ppl
so its not my home network
thing is tho
if u need to browse the web
in school
um
without blocks
wait
repl it vpn
yes
repl it vpn
does it work
or repl it proxy
replit hosting is real
i like replit
I need to do stuff
k
wait
raspberry pi
made their own
arm chip
Spotify®
WebSockets
i like to snoop
on what sites are doing
over websockets
spotify is playing ping pong
gravity must be really weak tho
cuz it takes the ball 30 seconds
to get from one side to the other
name me a website
that has like
interactive
live content
I did things
ramesh
have you heard of
Redis
Yes
I took your files and did stuff to it
?
this one
try figuring out what this odes
That means u r very wrong
Beyond tangible
xplain wtf this question means
plz
wait
i might have got it
How many electrons
Can it hold
In said quantum number
so like
2 per orbital
and then
No
that * num orbitals
* num sublevels
2 for the first orbital
no
its 2 for all orbitals
wait
no
its 2
for s orbitals
ooh unigram has a pulsing dot now
Idk why it was doing that
now hold on
Ur off by 4 I think
if n = 1
First ones 18
then
its 2
if n = 2
then its 10
Bruh
Its just 2n^2 i think
Use that formula
um
Might be 2n^3
why tho
i need to know
i will derive the formula
good bye
ah
i think
i might get it
?
Why do u have a picture of orbitals?
2(n-1)^2
2n^2
ah yes
U dont need an n-1
that is
correct
what
is this
each orbital
has 2 electrons
arsenic has 33 electrons
Not electrons
How many orbitals
yes
but
if i have 32 electrons
i will fill 16 orbitals
completely
and thus have 17
if i have 33
Its 18 total
15 full
Remember
oh wait
cuz
U gotta have one electron in each orbital
First
yeah
oops
Then u can fill em up
Also idk how u got the last one wrong
N=4 means 4
um
no
U can le check
Its 4
but imagine it were like Gallium
then the n = 4 would only be 2
Would it
yes
Idk bout gallium
well for arsenic
its 4
but if the question asked for anything less than arsenic
it would not be 4
not this
the hell is this
if theyre blank
theyre blank
why
*sigh
done
with
that
Idk
Good job
might as well do 6.4 whilst im here
The next one is also kinda annoying
Cause there is a 24 point tutorial
That normally takes forever
?
The lewis dot structure one
For us it was a webassign
And to draw
U needed to use MarvinJS
hmm
And there was a 24 part tutorial
On how to use MarvinJS
That u couldnt skip
It took longer than the actual webassign
wait
i see it
hmm
Dont press skip
why
No matter what u do
It doesnt give u points
*sigh
So ur gonna end up with a 24 point gap
hi akhil
i did it
with no
tutorials
Nice
We had one
my faithful space heater
has just
stopped
working
you turn it on
and it does not do
anything
the light comes on
and that's it
oh just making a mood board
for French class
in HTML
it even has opengraph
thanks to Ramesh for telling me that was a thing
i like how windows
thinks edge
is malware
i try to launch edge
and it triggers antimalware service execuatable
taking like 25%
of my 6 core desktop CPU
to stop Edge
and then it proceeds to slow it down
and prevents it from working
Microsoft needs to fix this
Stupid fuse
Why
cy is malware
cyware
cpyware
sπware
I need to make a telegram bot
that makes emotes sticker packs
so like the telegram sticker bot

*sigh
but mine will follow a few guidelines
but since unigram is uwp it works nicely on windows
when its done
ok
i see
look i have antennas coming in the mail tmrw

from where to where

im having fun with docker
its great
i am
its so convinent
thinking about
class
and not
class
because
bad
my teacher is like
ohtheresnozoomheressomeslidesgotothepac
and then like
the slides
say
meet in groups
and then
there are no groups
until you go to the slides for today
that were posted yesterday
then you see the groups
and the groups
are like
M
see a problem
?
repeat
that's not even the whole class
and then
when i try to make a zoom meeting
to meet with my group
it just dies
period 9
went
well
today
for me
is 0/0 defined
no
good
Ramesh is no longer scared
Ramesh is curious
f(x) = ?
hi im going to crawl the web
we start today
with 6 letter .com domains
first we identify which ones actually exist
it will take 85 hours
why 6?
short
like how girls' shorts
i mean what is it even with girls' shorts
why is it so short
it makes no sense to me
that's a solid almost 1000mbps
mine is around that
as well
oh
uhm
well
i have to transfer 1tb between my computer
over ethernet
and server
to back up
im writing a link tree generator
what
oh
yes those are interesting
joe manchin is interesting
Cough
Mines 24 mb
what
to ur server?
Yea
Well to my vm
I didnt try to the server itself
how do I solve my déjà vu
oh
they will probably be similar
server a little more probs
also try iperf3 not iperf
44 mb
then it's probably that
The IO errors hath begun
every time
i try
and crawl a page
it leads
to
twitter help
idk
what are you looking for
wdym
i wanna crawl the web
why
i just need to implement multithreading
cuz right now
one thread
in what language
is not
python
use multiprocessing
idk what its called
not threading
but there was this thing on stackoverflow
use multiprocessing
and i copied their code
and
it worked really well
i could like
concurrently download
400 instances of reddit
haha
at 300 mbps
i wanna buy a short domain name
i think it downloaded
like
1000 copies
in 4 seconds
dont make ur domain
some like
set of random characters
cuz then
no one will remember
it has to be memorable
fine
is better
than
sure
tell me a site
that you do not think
will lead
to twitter help
uhm
uhmmm
yeah no
that one
led to twitter help
Why r u trying to find 6 letter domains?
cuz imma start there
well actually
i paused
that
and now i am working on my tree crawler
which works
but
its really slow
But why this?
what else should i do
7 letter domains?
No
my list of 6 letter domains
is 6GB
But why so specific
cuz if i did 7
it would like
be bad
too big
U know what sure
too long
i wanna ask myself
how
leads
here
how
i think
every time
it goes to that page
it finds another
%Bamp
and adds it on
cuz
now its
here
I can get a domain
I have a dollar
what do I get
idk
which one to choose
leam is like gleam
thats not bad
ahhhhhhh
my lunch pd changes
wdym really
do you know what lazy static is
yea i go from pd 8 to 6
nope
Ooof
Mine is 5
wait
SIX?
buddy
5
ok good
i have apcs then
but it's actually my lunch period
?
apcs
period 5
but it's much lunch period
cy would be in accordance
huh
he is in
our apcs class
to "help"
except I can barely help people when people are utilizing hammers
Nice one
although I do help sometimes
dont u just love when the error count keeps going down by one
Nah
i like when it goes up
smh
how
when u didnt change anything
why
HAH
Wait no
the best
is when u have a ton of errors
and u dont change anything
and they all go away
yes
but how does that even happen
for me
how
its whenever I use the wrong compiler
also guys
you should try zig
it's another programming language
I wanna try go
it's supposed to be really fast to develop working stuff
which is appealing
Ill compile C using a python interperter
yea
its kinda annoying
but rust is just like really good
what
accident
why
i also am not setting up gitlab
im doing gitea
wait
why would u set up gitlab?
memory hog
i like this domain name
a lot
thats \
not bad
yeah
cause its is “speakable”
idk what the word is
I really like minimalistic titles
U can say it
but now I can do
um why?
wdym
that was what I chose
i dont set it as a subdomain
I do
I have multiple services
pihole would be
no ew
ew
no
subdomains r cool
imma steal the domain
how
dont do namecheap
i wont
im using the one on tld-list
porkbun
its 1.01 first year
but renews for 9$
um wut
syll is an SA reference
swyl is a corruption of an SA reference
both sound fine
dont add a number
yeah
idk how I feel about xyz
but it is cheap
yea 0.59
but then it goes to 8$
I want 3 letters but I'd go with this
I will transfer it
for something else
thats expensive
.com is cheaper
yeah but i only have a dollar to buy
hmmmmm
i would get either
ugh
both are fine
idk i want something tea-related maybe
porkwa?
idk
ooooh akhil knows french
i do?
porkwa
porquoi
same pronounciationi
*almost
huh
i know french
oui oui
Baguette
ignore this
diesel overwrites my custom schema
vin diesel?
no
cygh
I love lazy_static
only 422 of them
are /r/ pages
indexing the web is kinda fun
why
r
u
indexing
the
web
?
dont be google
cuz its fun
you just give it an entry point
and it like
finds
i have not given it Wikipedia yet
but there wouldnt be much point
since like
wikipedia you can already download the entire index
dont
it runs pretty fast
it runs 500 workers
concurrently
there is a lot of memory overlap
and it cannot count
but
in the end
there are not too many duplicates
^^ it trying to count how many pages it has seen
its fast tho
ideally it would be running on an actual db
and it would be distributed
so like
we could all run an instance of it
it gets approximately 33 results per second
wait
no
probably more
idk
Wide cy?
i have been working on pe
for too long
this
shall end
this
must
end
Huh?
Why
*sigh
im like
in that state
where
i should have done work earlier
but i didnt
Huh
U should have
But u didnt
Instead u started indexing the internet
yes
i will now go do work
bye
I should start doing this PE thing
I want to do it tomorrow
it's due on thursday
i think I might have found my domain
could be fun
IVT MVT Rolle's
Hmm
thonking
idk
time to call linus
"the 10 exabyte project"
Oh are you reading about the xkcd guy
no
remember
im trying
to index the entire internet
That is randall munroe
Xkcd guy
well
i set
as an entry point
for my crawler
Try the blog
it broke my crawler
How
it thought
you owned
twitter
...
and then
it just like
slowed down
i need to work on that crawler
How does twitter
Like my website does not link to twitter
your website
does
link
to twitter
like all sites
No
the issue i believe
is in passing the root
and then
it finds an external link
but
leaves
the root
while crawling that external link
so then
all internal links on that page
its a really badly written program
ima make one that uses an actual database
and it sort of
figures everything out
on its own
that way
you can like
run an instance
of my crawler
anyone
can crawl
for me
and watch
for their enjoyment
where the crawler is
i just need a 10 exabyte database
Yes
Or
its like FaH
Zlib compression
but its CaH
Crawling at home
you set an entry point
and then
crawl it
and then it marks things as done in the db
so that crawlers know where to go
Um
Cy at Home
Also RiiR
Rewrite it in Rust
no
it will remain
python
No
Rust fast
Rust threading good
Think about this
I'ma learn abuncha languages
You have two threads
K
Then one thread modifies thr data
While the other is in the middle of modifying it as well
Rip data
Yes
Rust does not let you
Counting fun
Accidentally modify your data
Mutex or it wont compile
Isn't this called memory safety
No
Maybe a bit
Memory safety is if you like
Free a pointer and then use it again
Also i sleep bye
Gn
Rust also doesnt let you free pointers
Like that
The pointer goes out of scope
Also idk if it's a pointer
It is an object on the stack
To alloc on the heap you use a box
Gn
They did it
They won the fricken courtcase
YES
how to use cycss
cy2basicstyle.css
corellium
RameshCSS
RaemeshCSS
ill keep the ae
i mean
but that uses a css class
its spelled wrong
oh
bluetiful
best button
in whole world
i updated this page
so now
it does not use a class
price vs quantity graph, the green line by me is apple
Yes
what
uh
cy have fun on your apcs quiz
bye
i get to program now
yes.
One UI 3 is mine.
11?
11?
yes
nice
i will also get an update to 12
since samsung extended to 3 generations rather than 2
Ugh
I will only get up to 11
And I haven't gotten 11 yet
I don't know whether or not I should custom ROM
btw
the mi a3
had 11
a long time ago
i may purchase another Android One device
jestchers look nicir
why is .xyz sketchy
I really dislike that people find it this way
since I cannot afford a .me
New media experience
I use both keyboards
maybe it's not
and i plan to wait
B
Battery Life ™
so if I go to school
I would see you
yes
should I come to school then
yes
I want to
how much
do you have to use zoom in school
since I hate zoom
every period
almost
see that is the problem
yes
my
lunix zoom
broaks
i use my phone
for zoom
in school
Hmm
work profile
yes
work profile
I must think further on this
the thing is this
its the social aspect
yes ik
i hate sitting at home
so if your friends are in school
it makes me sad
like
it is nice
yes
but if they all leave
then
but what about the
its unfun
health aspect
yes that too
coronavirus
but also
i am at higher risk than you maybe
getting up and moving around
i have immune system problems
i see
so
that is the concern
yes
thing is this
i am on the line between going and not
i am going rn
but
like
i only see akash
and like sam and matthew period 6
and if I came
if you came
we could walk home
ensemble
yes
that could be fun
the thing is I am really paranoid
at home
about what
about like
sanitation
because of covid
i mean
i can tell you
they all wear masks
and clean all the desks
what if
I wanna drink water
bring a bottle
with a straw
what
put it under your mask
oh
no you can take off the mask for like
a second
or just pull it down enough
to drink
or like some ppl
you can go to the corner of the room
my parents said I could go MP4
so I might do that
I see
they did not say I could go
they said I should go
hmm
i see
yes
so
idk
the thing is I really don't like home
i see
i mean i imagine it gets really boring and stagnant after a while
to just stay there all the time
yes
like
it saps my energy
to sit on zoom
the entire day
tbh i dont have much of a problem at home
one of the things i like at school tho
is like
i am very social with the teachers
yeah
I can do that too
and its much easier to socialize with them
there
and insult my government teacher more
which I want to
do
i can talk to mrs harding after school
yes
this is a thing
i can fix mrs tan's time
i can show ms baker how to use onenote
i can show Mr Y my app
Exactly
I can locate mr Harvey and discuss
the musical
how about the meetings
no
i mean the classes
like is it bad in class
educationally speaking
since the teacher is like staring into the screen instead of at the in-class students
yeah
it depends on the teacher
some pay more attention to zoom
others really long teaching to a class
and so
they focus more on the class
in school
Hmm
Interesting
I have to consider
the thing is
On one hand it will probably make my life better if I go to school
But I might die
moving from dual displays
to like
a phone
and a laptop
Yeah I know
i doubt it
its not very much in schools
also
the teachers are getting vaccinated
like probably this MP
so if ur doing MP4
then
uhm
hmm
they will probably start vaccinating children by then
i wanna go before everyone else goes tho
you wanna see the empty school
and the few people there
such as you
yes
at the same time
if it is so empty
theres like
much lower chance
idk the reports say
very little cases in school
have there been actual cases
there have been cases
of course
but
not many
i mean it is a pandemic-level virus
yes
so there will be spreading
Hmm
It is risky
tbh as a student
i would not be too concerned
unless you have serious underlying conditions
do people follow social distancing
mostly
cygh
idk
although
its more like
there has to be some implicit consent
so like
if you back away from people
when they approach you
then
they will cease approaching you
I do this
some people do not respect it
ok but its a pandemic
you gotta do
what you gotta do
yes
it is a pandemic
I dunno
I have to think
someone make a telegram bot
that integrates into emotes
what
would it do
no
but then
like
wait
it could add sticker packs
so it just appends like
i dont think bots can do that
maybe
idk
i mean
i could make a bot
that like
becomes
yeah but the issue is it shows up as from someone else
i could do that in like
2 minutes
true
*cygh
theme
good night
if there are too many
So you will need to use conventional methods or your system
that could be a motorola
thème
thèse
ykow
theres this
bing image bot
how does it work
here lemme make a recording
k
how does that work
that works
i think its called an inline bot
how hard is it to make one
idk ill read the api docs
and try to make one
like this
does it work for like
pngs
tf is this game
its like
2048
but with cities
btw
gamepidgeon
telegram
that
via bold
aw
no
this is what you want
make all of them stickers
idk
hmm
huh
how to send pngs
thats no fun
basically it needs to become a webp
then
make alla them webps
i can do that on my side
it will just be like
storage waste
cy is going to work on this inline thing
is a thing
I can send webps
and they turn into stickers
voila
so then you just need emotesbot to convrt to webp
first
lemme
just
make
an inline bot
Hmm
It has to be a specific size which is problematic
you could wrap a huge box around
Hmm
No I don't like it
Ah
Ngrok
Bueno
yeah
duh ngrok
so I need to compress it and add
this is gonna be fun
and complex
I would like the bot to do this
or not
*sigh
its not
working
here
its not in here
I would use voir
then yea
on ebay
*cough until your camera doesn't work
so he will leave
4GB ram
why does it work for you
it can be done anywhere
so it only enables gps when the user wants location data
don't worry you should soon grow out of that
but these are all problems that can be solved
can you send me the current names data
they make important decisions
a telegraph is 20 bits per second
wait
Vhat
I may try a webhook bot
rocket or actix tho
I mean u dislike rocket
no
some random person told me
"heHOO rocket bad"
Rocket es bueno
Its the most popular one
idk actix seems annoying
Hola
Um what
because anyone who "hates"
no
telepresence
Hola
emotes bot for telegram is gonna be great
Yes
Hola
akhilvanka: Hello
Finally
Tf was it doing
cdknight: Tf was it doing
Cy is cool
akhilvanka: Ramesh is cool
Ramesh is cool
cdknight: Ramesh is cool
akhilvanka: Ramesh
C—‌y
akhilvanka: C — ‌y
Add a weird space in between
The soft space
wait
i got it
C­y is cool
cdknight: C­y is cool
there
Yes
akhilvanka: Haha i can C­y now
yes
Wait for certbot u have to run it on ur machine right?
And the ports have to be open
no
not if you use
webroot
Whats that?
yes
it works
my bot
works
and then space
and then
a query
and you will get
moose
or whatever that animal is
10x Moose
someone send the moose
so i see its working
ah yes
yes
indeed
yes
so now
i just implement emotes
it rejects
my thing
card
so ill ask my parents to buy it
ramesh
oof
send moose
or I can just go to namecheap and buy it and use all the money on the card
which is a no
no
sendamoose
namecheap is bad imo
no
it has a good interface
but is kinda expensive
then click a result
i hate gym
ramesh
it works in here
yes
who doesnt
it works everywhere
this question is dumb
it is
if i had a million dollars id invest it
to make another million
thats also what id do
cy
what does the inline bot code look like
it requires complex webp manipulation that needs to happen telegram bot-side
I can write that code if you want
the bot
now
sort of
you need
ramesh
to convert it to a webp
somehow
send
an emote
through
the bot
ok so essentially do this
on your server
just store
both this version
and a webp version
of the right size
then also
no
you can do that part
add a search function
that exists
i store the webp version
in the api
you need an api key
Paste a valid YouTube link to create an in-group PlayTools share.
idfk why tf u need a fin api key
thats dumb
Hmm?
Fin api key?
f-in
Ah
Idk api keys r kinda useless
why
Cause someone can brute force it
not easily
Depends
you can make a Rust client for PlayTools
Its its number yes
PlayTools has an API
If its letter and number kinda
If its ascii no
do u want one
an api key
its also down
cuz its not a thing yet
wate
i gave you an api key cy
just go
you can also search
does this like store a session key
no
you have to implement the searching yourself
sorry
but it gives a list of all of them
wait
lemme
just
hold on
this is the documentation
wait
for the entire api
but then
i can only
search
global ones
you can also search non-global ones
namespaces are private
but
but
i wanna search
your namespace
if you are an admin
you can search any namespace
i see
actually no
but then the search is not that useful
no it is useful
you can use it
you have to fetch a namespace
hold on
how
do i search
the global namespace
like walk me through it
this
just replace that with your api key
idk where it is
uhm
does it work
gimme moment
this is gonna be bad
so it sorta works
if you @ the bot
it will bring up
all the global slugs
but its really slow
nah
it's fine for me
no
is it supposed to search
its supposed to
bring up the emote
if the slug you typed
exists
ok fine
that works
what about namespace support
um
it cannot search namespaces
it can
it can however
check
if a slug
in a namespace
exists
yes
it cannot list namespaces
what is the api to see all things in a namespace
in the api doc
but
with your api key
gimme a namespace
not mine
m
that's mine
I need to remove the path
there are no more paths
hey ramesh
it works
Afk
how do i list all namespaces
You don't
k
Intended behaviour
You search the namespace they provide
hmm
wait
Yes
where
Ah
arma kaptions
Cat
i want
my
kaptions
Make it
Webp
no like
512x512
i want it to show
the slug
Use the name
in the result
Not the slug
no
i want
the slug
so that they can type it
next time
or ideally both
but the thing isnt working
hold on
meh
it wont
work
but
you can
now do things
Yes it works
now do m/
and it will bring up
all of ramesh's
Hmm
Phone
Cy
Can u rename the bot
yes
Its a hassle to type
i can
rename
it
no
it has to end in bot
and it cannot be
emotesbot
or emotebot
s
o
it is
Why not?
emotesinlinebot
not available
Ah
Well make it something ez to type
Cause u cant do @ and have it pop up
I hate spotify
I dislike its mobile app
It doesnt work
hold on
there
works now
imma
make it like
webp
stickers
you can actually just like
Kwality
not kwality
Kook
HAH
Bueno
mmmeh
once you have the webps
gimme a ring
it needs to be 512x512
make webps
you are already doing image resizing
make webps
i cannot do it inline
it would take too long
fine
not in the sense that it would take me too long
but to resize images
I can give you the code to resize
in the middle of processing
an inline request
fine
would mean
lag
no you only have to resize it when sending
not while proecssing
true
but still
cuz also
i reference the image with a URL
so i would have to 1.
im seeing how annoying it will be
download
2.
resize
3.
upload
4.
link
it goes into the database
i have to like do weird stuff
ima eat a snack
then
ima do AP seminar
That is true
we will have to see
I see
wait
this may not be so hard
256x256 has to do stuff
okay
Ramesh is working on webp
I see
Akhil is dying
Cause he needs to study chem
And do spanish
cy's telegram
is not
no
this message
is old
you will not see it
telegram is not working
my network is broken
it comes and goes
yes
and
telegram
is dead
again
isnt celery that cron job thing
yes
I see
Why
Does
Spotify
Keep
Crashing
It stops playing music after like 30 seconds
No same with telegram
With me
I'm on cellular rn
Cuz it keeps dying
But spotify is working for me
Spotify isnt
It keeps fricken crashing
ramesh expects this to work
no ok
so
ねこ
idk why it's getting mad
えらうんかわいねこ
Is it not scaling them right?
no the webp stuff is jank
Library?
I fixed it
k NOW i need to do weird stuff with imagemagick
k so
this was programatically made
so now i can do some programatic cool stuff
done by emotes
next
uhm
why is it returning a png
cygh
hey cy
if you download images with ?tg=1 it will do it for telegram
btw imma disappear for the rest of the day so bye
What ?
Does that mean it works?
Yes
Nice
And fast
Like <1 second
Lol
yours takes like
is it done yet?
Lol
Yea it takes a long time
akash
you can send emotes
in this chat
the bot
Tf us that
A parrot?
Dad parrot
its not working tho
its supposed
to be sending
webps
what
There we go
but
no
*sigh
Viber
Why u have to put ur name on everything
yes
I am 3 minutes early
cy
ramesh
emotes bot
sort of works
try sending an emote
no
it loads forever
it might take a hot second
since
I disabled caching
for development reasons
loading
no don't do that
that won't send
webps
for some reason
just like
mention the bot
then it brings up all the global ones
then select one
still loading
also cy
are you using a webhook
yes
then
into the regular code
sure
nrn tho
Yeah that's fine
but also the bot is dead
um
if i were you
ICU too
it still no werk
let me try on the wack
oh i was using the wrong bot
what
namespace n owrk
mine is sorta working
hmm
wait
the mime type is not important
the content-type is
hold on
i think

cygh
stop caching
cygh
Ramesh
2 hours and 30 minutes from now
Is 3:30
?
hah.
Stacy's
yes
but emotes
no
this
should render as transparent
Yes
but
it is cached
No
It's not
it is cached
I disabled caching
how are you sending the images
does it use a link
or a file
Url
yes it is cached
add &v=5 to the response
and see what happens
Hold on
I'm on phone
okay
What url do I need
the old url
For photos
and add the parameters
&v=5
Just that
*sigh
apparently
this is not ok
I think
you have to send a sticker
something
is wrong with my json
hold on
but set the input_message_content
I uncached stuff
wait
if you send
a link to a webp
does that act as a sticker
yes but no
see
now if I download that and send it
I see
but i know the bot can send it too somehow
see
via sticker
yes
but
it has to
be a sticker
make the sticker
on telegram's servers
but
there is an input_message_content
hmm
wait
alternatively u could send a file
idk how
first lemme undie it
cuz its dead rn
after i literally changed like
nothing
ah yes the typical telegram bot
idk
wait
i think
imma figure
it out
ah this bot is broken now
or i didnt add it
its not
in the group
ima make an inline bot
something with the &v=5
is erroring out
remove it then
then it works
but it doesn't have the v=5
a wonderful
http GET request
I agree
i
have to enable it
oh
it cant see messages
k i think i can do something
Something interesting goes here
Something interesting goes here
that's wrong
Something interesting goes here
i dont think
an inline bot
Something interesting goes here
can send its own stickers
im working on things
or its own images
that would be stickers
ramesh
that is
a cached sticker
that is on their server
yes
then you could upload stickers
you could do that
every time
someone creates an emote
yes look I am working on a bot
why is the query caching
just to send stickers
but
you need to
upload
the stickers
let me see
I have some ideas
Now
Hmm
ik
how to do it
now
how
essentially
you need to 1.
you send a message
upload the sticker
on behalf of them
uploading the image
2.
idk
send the cachedsticker id
so essentially
you need to upload stickers
when the person creates an emote
and add tg_stickerid to the database
yes
for the emote
uhm
surely there is an easier way
no
wait imma think more
just wait
k wait
now
uh
what i do is
k so
see this
when I upload thonk.webp
telegram turns that into a sticker
so what you have to do is figure out how on earth that is happening
so you upload a file
and then you get the id
and then you send the sticker
no backend involved
cy
smh
where u find that
the telegram official api
so send as sticker
instead of picture
bot can send stuff like this
bot can send stickers
but
not as inline
yes it can
no it cannot send a sticker
Yes it can
on behalf of the user
InlineQueryResultCachedSticker
let me implement it
cached
it can also send messages on behalf of the user
so
but only text messages
let me see
um
i tell to you
that
the only way
is to first upload
then
send
as cached
then it gets complicated
yes
i have to modify the database a lot
yes
why couldnt they just
liek
not
hmm ramesh is going to think
see
this is a file id
so if I upload a FILE not a STICKER
it should still work
it has to be the right type
like 512x512 png
yes webp
if you do ?tg=1
it does that
no
512x512 png
PNG
it does
no webp works as well
im pretty sure
uhm
that's outdated
just wait
yes
i want
you should do that
to accept
payments
Dont
where is the uploadFiles
now how do i upload a regular old file
for gods sake
cugh
imma
upload a sticker and see what happens
a
and it works.
ok...
but
now it's doing weird wack stuff
i see
lemme inviestigate
telegram says "sticker document invalid"
cuz it gotta be a png
still invalid
i tried to send that cached sticker
uhm
ramesh may be doing a dumb rn
cy is cold
he wants his space heater
maybe
and it doenst have that
that are aimed more at traditional puzzle solvers
like this news that
i just dont like the stability of linux
an immense, continuous fabric
Then how would it know whether or not there is a meeting on a particular day
imma try on my fone
why does it work for you
this is annoying
it should work
I actually like uploaded a 512x512 sticker
but it doesnt
ramesh
lets make
our own
chat platform
maybe
but not rn
I want to solve this
i am 100% sure it can work
{"ok"=>true, "result"=>{"file_id"=>"BQACAgEAAxUAAWATEHCoYyFJLFtRNDw7YnUVrSQzAAJrAQACjFaYRNMKuKoC3-l_HgQ", "file_unique_id"=>"AgADawEAAoxWmEQ", "file_size"=>50943}}
k it still no send sticker right
so
Hola
komp cy
Uh
Sure
One second
uh ill wait till we go to breakout rooms
k
idk
just go to 400
ill join you
k
oh no
kevin is here
is fine
lol
why yall muted?
my microphone
is broken
use ur phone
i also cant hear anyone
k i cant hear anyone
so you CAN send stickers
z
having fun?
HA
Edge lunix
1. Download webp
2. Generate random name for sticker set
3. Create new sticker set
4. Call get new sticker set
5. Get file id from sticker set
6. Send inline
Or

1. Get incoming inline request
2a. If namespace, get namespaced emotes → get tg_file_id from image table and generate response
3a. If local, get tg_file_id from image table and generate response

When uploading: 
1. Resize emotes
2. Upload emote to namespace sticker pack.

When adding new global emotes:
1. Create a namespace row for global emotes
2. Set the sticker pack id there
3. Upload on request
why what is happening now
5 to 100
*cough
It skyrocketed from 5$ a share to around 108$ a share
tf
that's insane
sell now
it's in a bubble whatever that means
No mabye kinda
U dont want to sell now
u do
Cause nobody “buys” shares
just take it and leave
No no no
So essentially
Gamestop is a shorted stock
Means people expect it to drop
So they “borrow” a share
Sell it
Wait for it to drop
Buy it back
And return it
So
If u have a stock
And u didnt short it
U wanna hold onto the stock
For as long as possible
Cause anyone who shorts it needs to buy the stock
I do not understand
but I will do so later
I have to study for APUSH
Yes
I have a bunch of 8t
It
It was like my first shortsell in a while
Nice
cy is still trying to make notifications work
essentially
you need like
RSA galore
Oh no
you need like
3 different keys
for like
encrypting
decrypting
signing
signature verification
Ah
VAPID
gee that's nice to know
I dont want no dinosaurs with laser guns
YES.
YES.
IT WORKED.
Yay
only in firefox tho
now to see if itll work in krome
Thats a start
it doesn't work in edge either
but I know that it is coming in
i think it just has to do with the notification handler
like the one that actually produces a notification when a push comes in
there
so as of now
it works on firefox on desktop
and chrome on android
what are your thoughts
Lemme see
1st,
Nice piano
Second,
Nice setup
3rd
Yea its good
It actually works
it does
i mean
it doesn't completely
like
i still needed to copy and paste
The bare minimum works
the string
the subscription string
from the phone
to the pc
but
^
yes
so
We can build off of that
i think this is doable
Now
eyeohesse
I gotta figure out
Sekurity
On ios
eyeohesse
Cancer
ayeohesse
I dont wanna have to pay 100$ to do stuff
a year
If it just needs a dev key then i might have one
Cause i have a dev account
yeah if that's all we need
Just not the fancy dev account
then its fine
Yea
then that would cover
the low power part of it
and then
all we need to do
is the real time stuff
as well as the long term stuff
and then
we are good
we have a chat app
well we also need a frontend
but other than that
Yea
And sekurity
But thats second
well sekurity
i mean
https
wss
and ur mostly good
you dont need server encryption
especially if you use telegram
which
does not have
end to end encryption
and all ur data
is in Dubai
or russia
pick your poison
Ah
So
U need fancy dev account
My free one has nothing
yeahh
i mean
idk maybe theres some workaround
I mean
I can always
Really shoddily make an app
Cause honestly
yeah i mean
well
Id be the only one using it
cuz the thing is
like
this chat app is for techies
so like
if they have ifone
they can download
ur source kode
and install it
Yea
for push support
Cause i am not fcking signing my apps
Why is the account 100$
alternatively
you could just connect to telegram
and have it run pushes through telegram
or sms
I mean i could
Making an app would be easier i think
As long as a backend exists
yes
it is hard
to interface
with a
nonexistent
backend
Yup
ill start working on the backend tmrw
Nice
Imma start copying tg design
i think imma do an update id
so like
each message
is associated
with an updateID
each message
or edit
or delete
so you create an unchanging stack of updates
and then
when a client connects
they can simply find the current update id they are on
and then
ask the server for all updates with id's newer than that
and then
you get sync
then i could use redis or something
Yea
as a FIFO buffer
Wait should i add multi chat integration?
yes
of course
Hmm alright
but the thing is this
it really only needs to do push
you can just have pushes redirect to the PWA
cuz the PWA will work on ios
just without pushes
I essentially just have to redirect things right?
yeah
so like
when you get a push
I dont think thats allowed but ill try
Cause
Sekurity
no it like
opens a link
so the notification
opens a link
and that link
opens in the PWA
I see
Wait ur using a database right?
no akhil im just gonna use a
what do you think imma use
yes i will use a db
Yes
MongoDB
Of couse
Json is the best
Better than the rest
JsonDB
CyDB
this tho
since
i get free hosting
with them
Wait
Hold up
This could be super ez then
wdym
If everything gets written to a db in the cloud
I can just tell swift to monitor said db
wdym "monitor"
Like if a new message gets added
Itll send a notification
i mean
but then
it has to poll
the db
Right
I forgot bout that
normally
Ugh
you just use push
Sekurity
cuz the thing is
Sux
push
is nice
cuz its one thing
like
ios has a push service
and that is all that is polling
its probably really easy
to implement push
i mean after i stepped over the bumps
it was ez
to do push
with web
Ill see tmrw how to do it
ill see tmrw how to make a backend
Cause people have made chat apps with swift
But they use firebase
hmm
idk see if you can find ways
for websites
to do push
on ios
without paying
Yea
or if like
you can put it in like
"test mode"
or something
so that pushes work
cuz then
we have
one codebase
not many
im gonna convert reality
Ah
The 4 religions of the book
R u kidding me
80$
For metal
akhil go bing bong crash
Pretty much
akhil and i
are making
a chat platform
we could call it cymbal
*sigh
im a little brain dead
Of course
ryzen cpus are finally in stock
like actually in stock and not like 10 seconds sold out

firefox doesnt have background
also i disabled background stuff on chrome so that won't work either
chrome doesn't work yet
on desktop
…
it only works in firefox on desktop and chrome and samsung internet on mobile
also that site
can be installed
as a PWA
firefox dropped PWA support today
today
well
in chrome
yes
i did that
but
then notifications dont work
because it wont show them
idk why
edge
it gets them
?
send one
i need the string
not notif
subscribe does nothing
no first do notif

no
that's the sample one
if you send a string
wait
i can push
sent
no
send another
no i got it
hmm
k
bye
so it works for you
yes
interesting
on lunix
i have to do work
bye
bye
we can talk further
after
7th period tomorrow
i have maths 7th period
haha
ik why
it wasnt
working for me
i had
dnd on
and chrome and edge were using native notifications
I mean we do nothing in class anyway
so I mean we will now hav a productive period
what class?
this is out of context of apcs
and what b happnin rn
also isnt it just great when u have a group PBT and the only parts u get right is the ones u did
ah
hahahahahahahhahaahaa
we failed it
less than 50%
the only points we got were my parts
big sad
ut o
my zoom just crashed
well my grade didnt drop too much so im fine
nice
when joining a breakout room
michael
it b crasho
my zoom
is brok
same
it bork
is take long time
for werk
yuh
ima rejoin
cuz it dum
mmf
hake
hokaye
michael here
his zoom broak
hemlooo
i wanna add the webhook
or just PR it
emotes bot code is literal vomit
ill clean it up
I have to remove the API calls and make raw db calls anyway
I mean I can try and find it
its like
somewhere
although
it has the botid
lemme find it
imma generate uuids
e94b38f3d0dc4ee1840f7cbe760a3364
you there
hola
yes
what
akhil
i just
asked someone with a mac
to try the pwatest
and notifications no work
akhil
send me a pushapi string
from pwatest
on a mac
i clicked it like a million times
try chrome
cuz with this person the string worked in chrome
but
it wouldn't receive push
i clicked the button
which one
request notification
no now do subscribe
i clicked
what
no string?
that?
yes
thx
one moment
turn of dnd
and wait for a noti
sent
received?
nope
huh
sent again
this is weird
nada
just to let u know
what
what
hmm
do you have firefox
nope
what browser u hav
safari, edge
ah this was in edge
not chrome
ok
but
that shouldn't make a difference
from my testing
i think there is some issue with the service worker
although
the fetch event is not neccesary
for push to work
actually
edge and chrome do not use the same push services
ok so this needs some work
but
ik they should work on mac
once these issues are resolved
I'm in the lunch room
i will now
leave
the lunch room
actually
imma wait 2 mins
wtf
why is the emoji thing required
its so that like
for notifications
too bad
that cannot display the stickers
ill just like
💭
for everything
...
my dad sent me the trump money sticker
but
it comes up as the regular money eyes emoji
in notis and previews
I'm leaving
bye
bye
yes
ramesh did some cool thing
called a 512x512 blank webp
I see
mmmmm
aw
meh
STACY'S
so essentially
i copied
the playtools kode
and now
i will scrape out all the playtools stuff
but keep all the sign in and session management and headers and variables and time and all that tedious stuff
also
im getting a bit tired of inter
its a nice font
but
*sigh
i think imma find another font
for this app
Yes
Best OS ever
I see
I shall now open
How much ram do u have?
32GB
Cause u added an 8gb swap
Ah same
Then all u have to do is set up nixops
Make sure u add the thingies
U need an additional line that the guide doesnt show
no nixops for this
this is a nas
Wait this is nas
i dont need nixops
Right
Nixops on the other one
yuh
Ull find the line somewhere
ill figure it out after i set up the vm server
I gotta see how to get docker compose to work
Yup
ah the delete_instance thing doesn't work
idk
?
flask
Ah
Pithon
im in
i got into ssh nixos
now I can nicely edit the config
Bueno
I also got telegram to work right
there
Test 2
Has 12 cats
yes it uploaded too many stickers
Honestly im not even disappointed
Cats r great
haha

Almost 20 T of storage
10x more than me
yes
in fact
my desktop computer
40x more than me
Ugh
Stop flexing ur storage
I wanna get more
But drives are kinda expensivo
yes
i know
you will not see that
in case you were unsure whether vscode was an electron app
sampleMessages = ['Hello', 'Goodbye', 'Meh', 'asdfasdf', 'North Korea']
wth is this code
haha
it is vomit
i told you
this kode
will give u
koronavirus
just like
*cygh
look
it works
what works
works
barely
i mean
it works more than barely
its just
its not working rn
try
really
ugly
you need
api
im just scrapping this code
thanks
yw
im using PTB
what is PTB
PTB + webhooks
python-telegram-bot
what is PTB
ah
ok
use PTB
for your bot
it also has webhook handling
using tornado
ill think about it
rn im making my own chat platform
hah
when you forget to enable inline mode
telegram.error.BadRequest: Sticker_document_invalid
tasty
go boom
go boom
bam
stress testing
so what it does is this
it stores all the messages
in a dictionary
in ram
well
not a dictionary
a queue
and then
a worker
is responsible
for writing each item to the database
that way
the chat does not have db as a bottleneck
especially since im not using a local db
the instant chat runs in ram, over websockets
but persistence is achieved with a database
the only concern now
is that
if a user wants to recieve message updates
neither the db
what
oh
nor the ram
will have
i am doing the telegram bot rn
the whole
set of messages
this is the dillema
and so
the proper way to get all most current messages
is to first subscribe
then
recieve hyper-realtime updates
then
see what updates you got
then
decide how much u wanna fill in
above those messages
then poll the api for those updates
but in order to ensure that no message is lost
like for example
it has been pulled from the queue
but
not in the db yet
there has to be overlap
between the ram and the db
*sigh
now
to figure this stuff out
heres a question
so
the messages
should i store them
in a giant pool
like
all the messages
from all the chats
are just in a pool
all together
or
should they be stored
in an array
that is a field of the group
uhm
in an array
see but heres the thing
i need
to be able to
fetch
parts of that array
but not the whole thing at once
cuz if i have to fetch the whole thing
that increases load times
for larger chats
it works
yes just fetch the recent history
so i need to figure out
how to do this
in mongodb
or you use postgres
what is postgres
why
is it useful
idk
pagination?
mongo should have it
what is
pagination
look it up
ive like
never used it before
i just know it exists
pymongo
has
aggregation
where like
you can filter stuff
idk
no
it's like
limit in sql
select * from image limit 2
what is from
that selects
items
from the list
but
that is a top level list
idk
k
google
well stuff seems to work
stackoverflow
says no
it says
put them
all
in an unorganized collection
strftime python
yay I got rate limited
retry in 247 seconds
where is akhil
pie thin
beautiful kode
use rust
idk
i dont see that much better of a way to do this
unless
after working on this emotes thing
there was a
literally
returnwithout
i hate python
method
on dictionaries
NixOS best
hey cy
the entire bot works
yes
this does too
return text/json
i am
firefox renders it fancy
yes
i know
idk why not working
ah wait
i think its
application/json
works now
return jsonify
yes
i could do
that
but
meh
that's probably not compressed so it's fine
um
did it stop recording
no it works
also it doesn't support gifs but who cares
gif support barely works anyway
Cy's code:
as my third grade teacher used to call my handwriting
Ramesh's code
ill be honest
this is like
the worst code
i have ever
written
like
its usually not that bad
let's see some of your better code then
um
ok
fine
it's not that bad
yes
ramesh is kinda proud of adding tg support
why
why
why is there a circle
it literally says triangle for the love of god
the circle
makes it
an arrow
tbh
whatever
uh oh
you get to see my 503 page
can i have your haproxy config
no
why
i want to set up haproxy
thus I wanna see what it looks like
not all of the config
google it
its like
you can send me like a snippet
the easiest
thing
ever
huh
easier than nginx?
since im not even gonna be using nginx
im using caddy
i mean
i only use it as a proxy
yes
im not sure if does web host
that is all I will be using haproxy for
its like
and caddy
its complicated
you define
my set up
backend
and frontent
and then
like
global settings
and that's it
m ok
and load balancing is literally
the word
like
and proxying websockets
is like
not a question
proxying https
without interrupting it
is like
you say tcp
instead of http
yes
ik haproxy does
tcp proxying
nginx its like
well
bad
ive used it
apache2 is worse
imma do this
the most basic version of my chat app
is almost working
that is Very cool
i have to
eat
dinner
with my family
so i will do that
then
i will finish it
and you will see
it work
Hello
I am alive
But dying
our
chat app
hi
things you missed
Works?
ramesh made emotesmlbot work
100% work
Please do
almost
Nice
ramesh is learning nix rn
Nice
the language
i am leaving
bye
Isnt it called hamskell or something?
no
it's just nix
no haskell
Nixe
Ah that
I see what you did there
it works
Yes
also gifs dont work so ur namespace doesnt work
Good
Huh
gifs r gonna be a nightmare
Thats fine
ill deal with it later
if i want
Cause tg specific format
yeah
you have to turn it into like
a
What r u gonna do with nix?
nas
im already working on it
I decided imma install tmrw
i wiped out all the drives
nooo
The labguage?
install it now
I cant
sat?
I have a ton of work
Yea
f
Cause im an idiot
And forgot to do the stuff
nice
i never took an sat prep class
Luckily
I am really quick at reading
I do it pretty fast
ooh nice
i am not good at the sat
so
*was
i had to get good duh
Obviously
What website r u using to learn nix
I wanna make a docker-compose thing in nix
So instead of using a yml file
I just write one in nix
you can autogenerate them
yes
but you have to learn nix first
Gracias
Ill do it after writing and language
haha
that sounds good
yo
what happens if we post emotes to HN?
?
you post stuff here
Ah
Hacker news
Does it even have support for things like tenor?
Cause if it works with tenor it’ll work with urs
wdym tenor
it has twitch support though
The website
Does exactly what you do
idk how to twitch
gifs
not emotes
Yea otherwise the same thing
ur saying i could upload it to tenor?
but it's not as easy to remember
Yea dont
I just realized u have ez to remember urls
yes
it's also for discord remember
I just tore apart my dads phone and repaired the charge port
whyphone
Yuh they suk
Bc a simple repair like having ur charge port replaced takes like the whole bord to b repaired
Bc they glue in the charge port even tho there is a separate connector
hola
haha
ima make the chat thing do what chat things do
like
add emotes integration
hey someone
could you
like
open this
I am sending more messages
fillin
my mongo
yes
im brian kemp
i own guns
I think I stopped you
no
i left
remind me to add spam protection
yes
telegram has it
that was twenty thousand messages
in
like
30 seconds
so why not you
anyway
stress testing
my mongodb
is good
good
its not mine
its literally
in iowa
use your own
smh
i dont feel like it
just another hassle
and point
of failure
I mean
i will if i need more than 500MB
but i could just like
Yea
be space efficient
hi akhil
Hola
you can thank ramesh
for
literally
DOSing the app
before you could try it
Gracias
How
How did he manage it
he like
idk
did like
while true: send()
and as you know
websockets
are
Hi
like
My computer
he did
Ah
Is frozen
20k messages
in
30 seconds
Damn
Owo nowo
The mouse wont move anymore
haha
take that
mine did not crash as much
Sad
it just crashed the tab
Yeah but firefox
Mine crashed
And i wasnt even doing anything
mak lol
Mac os is weird
It crashed cause of a cpu panic or something
Idk
Luckily it comes up pretty dang quick
Thats gonna take a while
Was this because of me?
No
Hah
U cant
It wouldve been funny
It would have
Ramesh has reminded me
i need
dos protection
cuz like
you can break it
with like
one machine
But i dont have random nginx stuff
spamming
Like cy does
lol
Fail2ban
Yes
This is good
nixbox
Ok maks kinda kool
It has stelf mode
what?
Where if u ping it it wont respond
Fancy ikr
oh
i see
yes
wait
rameshs
entire
pc
crashed
yes
he went capital
it destroyed the entire thing
i think memory pressure
im doing it again
Memory pressure?
Like blood pressure?
this idiot
u no get another try
is gonna spam cy again
until
Huh
It gonna take a while
i mean
i could test
its down
yes
it is
i cant connect
because
i stopped it
and now
it is trying to stop
but before it stops
it empties the write queue
and you filled the write queue with 20k messages
its only supposed to hold like
5
Um
Ramesh good job
i could force stop it
yknow what
why not
lets do this again
Haha
Cy
online
U need better protection
no protection
wait
ramesh
dont start yet
imma time it this time
I have never seen someone
Want to be dosed before
akhil
akhil
is a virus
ramesh
when you are ready
tell me
I DIDNT EVEN DO ANYTHING
i star the stopwatch
who is connected
me
ah
send something
um
it might be me
nope
ramesh
but ur website is not loading
and doing anything
dosed it
Perfect
its not dead tho
reload
its just ahtat
persistence
will not start
for a while
k so it did 5k in 15 seconds
yeah its about 15s per 5k
so about 333 per second
these are new ones
not adding to the previous ones
what's the rate
this
this
wdym
u said theyre new
yes
they're still
333/s?
no while you were spamming
i timed
5k
I did not spam
you did
prove
i spammed
um
Ah what
um
akhil coulda done it
I crashed my computer
since I don't think I did that
Nice
Somehow
um
By being on ur website
welcome to the club
maybe it was akhil
My comps crashed
Idk the command
uhhh
unix
and linux
dying
I would have done it
uhhhhhhhhhhhhh
remember mongo is running on a server in iowa
アイオワ
idk
a solid 8gb
Lets see what apple says happened
this does not rely on mongo
mongo is dealt with in a worker
celery
no
not celery
it uses python threading
huh
on a raspberry pi
oh
that's why
oh
ohhhh
my pc ram is not
even apple doesnt know what happened
wait
going up
i forgot
it was running on a pi
right
lets see the RAM usage of the pi
the pi has a direct 1gbps ethernet link
to the internet
340 mb in use
up from 240
which is the normal amount of ram
it uses
pi is nice
it cheap
and good
for web hosting
should i locally dos it
yes
k
then turn on cloudflare attack mode
get a kali
live image
this does not run through cloudflare
no
oh.
um
what
ow
owwwww
owwwww
i just
bit
my lip
reallllly
hard
get a band-aid
stupid
it like
put it on ur lip
yes
sticks out
no
we will
stop
talking
about my lip
HAHA
should my platform
support
deleting messages
yes
ofc
like an ethical question
please
We need to delete messages
owwwwww
blood
lip
how
im confused
i like
bit it
hard
like
real hard
did u like eat it?
almost
ima locally dos my server
lets do that
yes
yes
from a browser
yes
yknow
multithreaded dosing would be VERY cool
i got
12k
in 8 seconds
bc ur local
yes
wait
lets try
from a replit
no
too much work
go ahead
No wait
its ws
thats why
That would be a good idea
ws is less common
to ddos
my database
is at 1MB
rust: panic
go: panic
nix: abort
Christopher nolans music for his movies is great
yeah
imma listen
I should do the nix thing
if you want
you can
go into a replit
and install firefox
and dos it
yeah but like
How?
im lazy
pkg install firefox
idk
I am also
actually
imma just do it through python
wait
we could like
all
it wont work
run the dos command at once
idk how to websocket
client
i wanna do it with rust
My computer dies every time i do it
and spawn hundreds of threads
you will hit a limit
on your
im doing it
bandwidth
ummmm
ill run it for like
10 seconds
u have gigabit?
no
also i wont
my brother is doing an interview rn
and like it might crash the internet
ah
i would rather not crash the internet rn
my parents will kill me
yes
and so will my brother
yes
lets see
so
ok so
essentially
i can write it for you
i know how to thread in rust
ik python
rust threading is real threading
i mean in python
i was able to
GIL
concurrently download
500 instances
of reddit
at 400 mbps
haha
400mbps
is like
the highest it gets
up here
on WiFi
mm
akhil
akhil
its
an
and it
works
imma eat
afk
bye
i think
it is time
to make
the thing
work
cuz right now
when you open the chat
1. ramesh doses it
and
2.
it doesn't load message history
which is saved
if
3. ramesh doesn't dos it
so
i need to make it
retrieve message history
i mean frankly
this is a decent simulation
of like
6 months worth of messages
being stored
my favorite app is playtools
it like
ddosses itself
theres a bug
where
the players
will turn into
an uncoordinated ddos network
aimed directly at the server and the database
je suis ici
bonjour
cy forgot
bonjour
how do use
XMLHttpRequest
uhm
use fetch
not xmlhttprequest
how
idk look at MDN
what does this mean
convert response to json
for further processing later
so like
but
why not
response = response.json()
jason
idk
it's stupid
oh ik
why
its because
async?
then is a function
yes
no like
it returns a promise
=>
means
function
uhh
so it defines
a function
idk i dont like js
the end
that takes
response
and then
converts it to json
and returns that
then
it takes that
passes it into data
and then logs that
i get
it
i have to get my food
k
i do not understand fold
at all
what
telegram
how
do
i
what
why
how
it
ramesh
it is telling me
how on earth did it not parse the json
bad json
that's how
but
i dont know
why is fold so confusing
literally
i need
to
do
cors
cors
i have to like
stop cors
server side
ez
could i ask
someone
to go to
that page
and not dos it
and
test it
I
idk
go to the page
this is hard
type messages
literally this seems easy
l8r
wait
this is hard apparently
got it on the second try
the first try I forgot a semicolon
k im done with that
FINALLY
k so now
the database is strictly
persistence
can I break it
no
you can examine how
despite
me
adding
a
synthetic
5s latency
on all calls to the db
the thing still works
and still updates
when you refresh it
it still works
just fine
it does not rely on the db
i could kill the db
and one
hmm
could hold a conversation
until
the ram
on my pi
ran out
that said
it is bad
to run it
without the db
cuz the only way to get messages without the db
when you connect
but this is good enough
to cover the like
2 or 3
messages
that might not be persistent yet
what if
when a user connects
the messages
dont get saved anymore
wdym
like
if the db crashes
no
yes
it wont
how do you know
the only way it crashes
is if i
break it
or
if it runs out
of space
also
the worker would likely crash
if the db died
and if the worker crashes
the realtime still works
but the persistence wont
it seems that nixos
has a firewall
i can access localhost from localhost
but not from elsewhere
et voilà
ça marche
cdknight: it works
if anyone is still awake
what
it now
does
things
it now
persists
and
it has
infinite scroll
hmm
link it
wgat
wgat
if you are making a custom chat platform
please
please
please add custom message types
like imessage
wdym
custom message types
xPlane
i have a doc on it
give me a few minutes
idk
even i cant read that
no not that
ramesh
give
no
a high level
explanation
im reading
custom message types are html5 boxes within the chat application
so like
that way they are cross-platform
wait
let me finish
a little app
yes
iframe
it gets embedded
then what happens is
no
not iframe
not iframe
it can be like
a div
the app
can call
functions
of the chat application
no basically
when you send a custom message
it will go and send a request to the custom message server
with some chat info
like the room name
and the sender
and like the other people in the room maybe
then the custom message server will take this data and return html
the chat application will mount the html
then
or maybe it's not html
maybe it's like a custom language
hold on
but
so
whats the purpose of these
imessage
no
gamepidgeon
so like
heart rate
to embed games
or bots
or polls
and emotes
whatever it is
yes
hmm
if you make this
you don't have to implement that
I can
implement it
so the way i would do this
is
i would have the message contain a "schema"
as you say
which would contain
a width
yes
height
and url
and then
yes
like webhook urls basically
hmm
idk i have to think how that would be implemented
I had an idea
then I forgot it
well cuz like
like I actually had a very detailed plan on this
if you want the embedded "app"
to be able to operate chat
security and authority are things
yes they are
so you could have apps that cannot operate chat
you have a marketplace
yes
and so
verified apps
unverified apps
they have to be authorized
then they can access things
otherwise
they can only embed
hmm
interesting
yes
you could use stickers
that are only embed
and like
yes
idk
so its like
just
a remote server
fetched
thing
also it could have access to sesnors
yes
but that would work because it's a webview
btw i actually made an app like this before
i see
the problem is this
how do you prevent
a script
in the thing
from
accessing
the global app's functions
XSS?
yes
essentially
why disable javascript
easy
on what
the stuff that comes from the external apps
wait
is that like
that could be a problem
a property
of the div
no
dont disable javascript
just like
it needs to be containerized
somehow
im thinking
this is a non-issue for phones
why
it's not running
like that
it's running as an app
its a PWA on phones
so its still an issue
um
what about a safe tag
what is that
its a tag
in html
that
gets rid of
all dangerous things
like scripts
embeds
onclick
all that
thats a server side thing
no
wait
is it
yes
ha
i think it would have to be an iframe
yes
or
but not a sandbox
you could come up with your own UI rendering system
no
i could but like
no
an iframe is easier
yes
also
that "schema"
would have
a webhook url
that
the client
would send data to
to identify
the chat
so like
ppl in the same chat
could like
play the same game
so like
yes
you send a schema
the schema says
for each different user
400px
it sends a different
400px
user
id
to the webhook
some_url_for_iframe
some_url_for_groupid
but then
the embedded app
has to do the rest
yes
also it could have "options"
which would be rendered
by the client
and would be able to perform chat actions
hmm
i guess
the thing is if you implement this tiny framework you can build rich interactions entirely with this
like no need for bots
well
bots
literally this could cover bots
can read messages
this cannot
mm
you can do something about that
no the idea is
these things are containerized
so they can like
place things on screen
and run in their own little container
but
they cant do anything else
for security
if you want
you could add their associated bot
which could read messages
and send
and such
maybe
what if you got the containerized stuff
to run on the chat server
so it can't leave the server
but whatever it is
it cannot
then that would be a burden on you to set up things
yes
but also
it would not be neccesary
the dev of the embedded app
simply has to
host a site
that can be embedded
in an iframe
and host
a config file
yes
with like
their app's name
and icon
and width
and height
and such
yes
what about transparency
like a transparent frame
why would you want that
stickers
but
stickers
can be predefined
except unlike telegram
support fetching from url
or
if you just
implemented transparency
there would be no need to implement stickers
a transparent iframe
make the core app smaller
it could use js canvases as stuff
and 3.js
no
that's
too much
again
stickers
should be
that's not what you're implementing
leave the stickers to other people
"small government"
ramesh is a conservative
the thing is
how
do
you make
an iframe
transparent
just like
you dont do work
they do the work
hmm
that is
interesting
so essentially
in chat apps
would have "screens"
defined in their config
one of the screens
would be the keyboard screen
with this
they would be able to
interact and choose what they want to send
then
once they select what they want to send
the embed
sends an xhr to its server
and then
prompts the user to press "send"
and then
Triangle
sends a request
to that server
asking
what the user selected
and what to send
and then
the server returns what to send
and that is send as a new "screen"
or actually no
there would only be one preset screen
which is the picker
idk
so in place of a mobile keyboard
would be the picker
yes
this picker
allows a user
to select
games
stickers
emotes
whatever
and then
somehow
send them
i wanna
write my own smb server
*yawn
go do that
imma sleep
samba isa piece of garbage
this works
hey cy get on the train
nixops is great
i see
do you know what it does
i might try it
next time
Nixops is great
i need
what does it do
programatically define vms
and all the services inside it
i see
how difficult is it
so if you want to run playtools if you make a nix service
to set up
a bit tricky
but we did the hard work
so you don't have to
Normally its ez
no
it's broken
Well hold on
i mean
i think
i wanna run
We technically didnt
PlayTools
serverless
on like
heroku
or google AppEngine
or something
Some guy on github did
Ive heard about this
Never tried it
the thing is
playtools
can be run serverless
like
completely serverless
Pretty sure we get some deal with github dev pack
like
no workers
are required
so i think
i could get like
realllllly cheap
Huh
atm im designing the Triangle Chat app
tf is xinetd
it like
doesn't look that good yet
im making it a material dark theme tho
and its gonna be kool
and imma have to learn about
client side rendering
cuz the app is gonna be entirely client side
like
a static page
i have to eat dinner
bye
…
client side rendering aint fun
alas
it is time
to learn
jquery
please no
alas
yes
idk
stop using jquery.
i was using the dom api
but then like
it gets tedius
whaddya wanna do with jquery
lotsa stuff
idk
maybe ill start
without jquery
ill see how far i get with native apis
yes
do that pwease
im betting
how do you like
set
by the end of cy's 11th
lotsa
he is a
css properties
mac dev
who only writes nodejs
and full stack web apps
uhm
like
idk
what is a "full stack"
line by line
idk but
you will know
by the end of 11th grade
my statement is thus still true
ah yes
full stack
like
the whole thing
yes
now I gotta
i am
that type
of person
yes
but then you will write everything in express
and use react
i might
and swear by your macbook pro
no
yes
watch
windows
is good
they are adding lots of
features
desirable features
like wsl
just watch
apparently
this year
windows will gain the ability
to run android apps
natively
um
what
google is gonna get mad about that
theyre gonna start
sans google play services
then
theyre gonna try and make deals with google
microsoft play services
to get access
um
how though
using wsl2?
as the android kernel?
idk
but its a similar idea
meow
port fawhwading in nixos
actually
i think
no
so what
will happen
is
that
is that devs will have to
submit their android apps
to the Microsoft store
stripped of google play services
what about flutter
will that work with microsoft's android runtime
idk
also
apparently
wsl
can do gui now
and gpu acceleration
eee
embrace
extend
extinguish
SteveBallmer
"get on your feet"
"aaah"
"aaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaAaaaAaaAAaaAaaaah"
idk that
makes me laugh every time
developers
developers
developers
developers
developers
developers
developers
developers
developers
developers
developers
yes
i need to find the destination programatically
ima make the chat frontend
also
i just realized
telegram chats
are not
encrypted
yes
on the server
so the russians
oh
and the saudis
can see
telegram isn't
everything
we send
yes
even facebook
doesn't do this
yes
unless you use encrypted chats
this chat
is not
encrypted
yes ik
and you can't have encrypted chats
on the desktop
only on y0our phone
you cant have encrypted
group chats
yes you can
on matrix
no i mean
not on telegram
Triangle will not have server side encryption
but
it will not be
in russia
or dubai
triangle should like
should
what
like
not store any messages
at all
that would be cool
no
i want
a cloud backed
messenger
i want a challenge
if u want
no stored messages
use nochat
it does not store your messages
or use signal
what is nochat
it also doesn't store messages
nochat
oh right nochat
fix
nochat
i was gonna add like
something
to stop that
then
i said
no
i have
you can sanitize it somehow
yeah
<safe>
well actually
no
you just
no I
ban
I did this for flim
FLIM
my mom
hush
studies that
I … see
she like
talks about it
all the time
although
now
she speaks
of
Light Sheet
i see
LSM
LSM
intérssant
she wants
a microscope
that costs
800k dollers
get it
and so
she writes to
ppl
and tell them
i wanna moneys
and then
she needs a workstation
also
she will have to use Linux
yay
because
the Rutgers supercomputer cluster
requires linux
i think
I see
doesnt do anything yet
but it is mine
for two years
i see
cy should try nixos
eys
like that
TechAltar
the beginning song is good
HA
YES
D
YES YES YES
I LIKE IT
appl
has not
piqued
good
their interest
good
i like that
does nix have apt
no
nix is a package manager btw
i see
you can install it on debian if you want
i see
so its essentially
a list
of packages
not really
that it stores
you can define functions
it's a programming language
to generate a list of packages
with configuration attached
which it then turns into what you'd see on debian
i see
yes
you see
ima continue
working
on my chat
frontend
you should deploy stuff on nixos
it would make things easier perhaps
idk
time to ssh into aws
eww aws
amazon bad
meh
use
google
liniode
vultr
my parents only know about aws
digitalocean
so they will only fund me on aws
so it's fine
vultr is cheaper
than aws
vultr has 3.50 option
and even 2.50 option
IM HAPPY
what
what
I can edit router setting now
ah
wait how
yes
that
can make
one
happy
optimum
unborked
yes
yes
this
is
amazing
cy
how do i haproxy
just like
haproxy one thing
should i do
what ramesh
would do
and say
"google it"
no
or
please
should i actually
send
relevant info
i mean u should
cause u got haproxy working
here lemme
ssh
into my server
with haproxy
google it is a way of saying idk figure it out
rtfm
k im in
imma figure this out
if i forward a port
and nothing is listening
does a port scan still see if the port is open?
idk
cause i need to see if port 25 actually gets forwarded now
i needa haproxy http and https
hmm
I see
wait
so your https doesn't do like let's encrypt right
it just sends it
it does
nothing
k
it just proxies
does it preserve the host IP?
no
wait
wdym
like can you get the ip address
of the person who connects
using haproxy
idk havent tried
but also
i need that
there are so many other things
i mean
tbh
preventing me from doing that
it should be fine
dw about it
how do i
include a file
idk
forget it
ill just
put it in the big file
interesting
ugh
wireguard is being a problem
cy is
*cough
liking
*cough
client
side
rendering
not liking
he has to like
Ha.
i ahte it
create his elements
too
in js
idk i hate it too
there must be a library
for this
oh
ramesh is dumb
no ramesh is not dumb
wait
HTML5 templates
are a thing
lets use
ona those
use
emberjs
what if
i can
avoid
that
and just
use regular js
maybe
its like
idk i gave up around this point
you make a template
I think it is a good idea
import it in the js
since it's less work to get data from the server and put it on the client
then like
modify it
then
append it
uhm
I think react/vue
is supposed to be for this purpose
yes
it does the templates
i like
server side
rendering
but
im not
using it
idk why
idk if this is really "client side rendering"
its like
it doesn't have to be
just
a ton
of updating
on the page
its faster in the end
since
you are not navigating between pages
and since its a pwa
the whole thing gets cached the first time
and so
load times
are not a thing
so it just reduces
all the load
everywhere
and it works offline
which is
the most
important thing
for a chat app
idk
how to do that
imma use a template
try it out
eventually
you will want to try react
^^ from 2013
i might
want to
but
not now
it would be funny if wireguard wasn't working because of scamazon
um
i think i have a typo
no im just a huge idiot
I forgot
I FORGOT
to add the external ip
and then i wonder why it doesnt work
hmm.
haproxy keeps timing out
ramesh is dumb
I just
crashed tmux
i see
i just
how
got
is this even possible
things
to work
i am closer
caddy is trying to spam the letsencrypt servers
but I want it to do a selfsigned
unless of course
caddy doesn't let you
turn of https
cy is happy
which would be royally stupid
things
work
time to add
actual
functionality
*sigh
already at 300 lines
so
nvm
it doesn't look bad
that's the point
im glad you noticed
form > functionality
yes
atm
yes
cuz
it does
nothing
i am excited
when this is done
i will finally
have a chat platform
yes
without compromise
will you make everyone switch to it
yes
i will
except me
i like telegram
you will be able
to embed
apps
in this platform
we shall cyee
the thing is
like
this chat platform is like
not a literal joke
like
nochat
or the zoom chat
what
are
you
doing
setting up a reverse proxy
how
long
does that take
a long time
you have been doing this since like
why
idk
idk how to use caddy cy
caddy?
so
i have to figure it out
k
imma add functionality
ttyl
ow rite just forgot
this whole thing
has to work
on mobile
fun
ooh my dad is watching something
i didn't know chrome just like
monitored cast devices
i have switched to chrome
yes you can do that
bad
bad
bad
bad
edge
is dead
it like
doesn't work
anymore
get vivaldi
it's like
better than chrome
no i wanna use chrome
so Microsoft gets mad
and sees
they lost a user
to chrome
because edge broke
no use vivaldi
also chrome is kinda nice since it syncs with google
so
and its the most popular browser
so its good for dev
what i dont understand
is why
Microsoft
leaves
their browser's logo
as
an E
literally like 50% of their userbase
associates "E"
with internet
with old, slow, outdated, obselete
explorer
since it's microsoft
like
dont call it edge
call it like
anything else
what happens if I run reboot on aws
will it destroy everything
idk
replit is interesting
it like
does something similar to nix i think
when you leave a replit untouched
it erases the container
and then
when you come back
it regenerates it
and reinstalls everything
Ah.
I fixed it.
no
nix doesn't delete it
nix generates it
ik
but if you DO delete it you can
but replit has a way
Finally.
to like
Literally finally
i like how this
brings joy
you can borrow my Haproxy
503 page
no
i wanna make my own
with css
caddy is bad
hmm
ah
it doesnt work
cuz
cloudlfare
Interesting
wont work rn
great
now
i
have
it like works some places
to deal with
nginx
and doesnt
I use caddy
btw™
this is a thing
what is
teakettl
wait
it loaded
idk why it takes so long
that took forever tho
it shouldnt
i shall iperf
so its like
gitea
but like
kettl
but like
teakettl
ok
yes
gitea → caddy → haproxy → web
dont ask
im
crazy
i mean
apache → nginx → haproxy → web
mm
i mean
nixos does a lot of abstraction
it will do even more abstraction later
asdfa;sdlkfa;sdlkfj;aslkdf nginx
not working
i need to serve a web page
and its not
working.
the speed is too slow for my liking which is unacceptable
yes
i must now
identify
why
hi
did i ask
for
this
no
nginx bad
use caddy
no i will
use
nginx
a;sdflka;sdlkfja;sldkfj
the file
is
right
there
just
open
the damn file
why
doesnt
it's nginx
it work
being useless
its good when it works
when it doesnt
its bad
see wireguard is running at kbps
no it's running at like 100mbps
so
also it loads instantly
on curl
which is strange
hmm
I am doing a change
here
there
it appears
now its time
to make it
actually
get
i cant
and send
messages
send stuff
yes
that's cuz
it does
nothing
huh
thats a job for now
I did not
copy your haproxy config
so
idk y it's slooooow
idk either
20 seconds to load
that is a problem.
i removed roundrobin and it now loads a bit faster
i wuv web dev
a;sdlkfja;sdlkfja;slkdfj;aslkdfj
this speed is atrocious
literally
gitea should take less than a second to load
literally
I have identified the issue as haproxy
imma use varnish
hmm
wtf is this performance
hmm
idk
Hmm
I wonder if I bump up the specs if it will work
the vm is running on lik
500 mb
the lowest end
ec2
which costs $0.20 less on vultr
1 way  is fast
the other not so much
cy is like so mad
its not
scrolling
this may be it
it kinda
works now
can u clik
and like
send
*Sigh
yes
k
i believe
that has been
mostly
mitigated
fix it
fix what
rate limiting
is a thing
yes
that i have
not implemented
not yet implemented
i shall
wireguard is infuriating
but for now
avoid
i rebooted
the aws
conclusion: the bridge is slow; get rid of bridging and things will be fast
cy is done
for today
it scrolls now
as well
I moved it to linode
and it loads faster
this
ah
this is on fios
I'm on wifi on my phone
...
should i do that from my nextcloud server
on ethernet
yes
ok
i hate optimum
tf
yes
i get like
5 mbps
i wanteda send an emote
but
bot ded
yes
i killed emotes
imma fix it
im changing it from linode to aws
why
linode
is faster than aws
for me
from linode to aws
so ur making it slower
no it wont
it will be the same
the iperf speed and wireguard speed
but
is faster
why
are you
from aws to linode
switching
so I have to use linode for my reverse proxy
from aws
and aws for emotes
or from linode
get a load balancer
imma get a vultr
i cant
i see
vultr is just cheaper
so i can get 2 vms
instead of 1
they have a cheaper option
also they have an even cheaper option
that has no ipv4
idk how that even works
Ipv2
no it has ipv6
Oh wait what?
imma haproxy gunicorn
nginx bad
oh wait i have a bunch of certificates
ahh
Thats cool
Im sad
Cause my macs being a bad
i see
And cant ssh into my rpi
on ur mac
it is kinda
crap
ima fix
on phone
emotes later
Um
as of now
its gonna improve
it will be a bit complex
bye
bye
i gotta homework
I also have to
Linix
Linix Indeed
could someone explain
to me
what the deal is
tmrw
with 
"abbreviated"
schedule
i haventh noth clue
it makes no sense
akhil
are u on mac
rn
um yes\
im always on mac
doesnt exist
404?
no cause u spelt it wrong
haha
es bueno
doesnt look half bad
wait reload
the message stays
reload
again
um
it looks laggy for some reason
in the video
its not tho
some advancements were made
it is now
a PWA
and
best of all
it vibrates
like
when messages come in
like just a little click
for each message
most important feature.
hmm
brrrrr
works on mobile
as a pwa
in a few seconds
i will see
k now i will see
im done with my homework
dont spam
we should switch to Triangle
when its done
if it's a flutter app
yes
else no
why do you want a flutter app
you know
it would just be
a web app
if it were
a flutter app
not really
flutter is not web
literally it's not
well its not if you like
compile it for android
but then like
i have to pay
moneys
also flutter apps are like
really ugly
no not really
they like
have their own frame
and their own things
you can use the cupertino theme
and they are not like
native
if anything
i would use react native
is a flutter app
i have seen that app
i dislike it
it is
ugly
really ugly
not really
you think it is
its slow
and ugly
idk i could make a flutter app
but its just like
not nice
the only thing it would give me is like
notifications
on ios
what is wrong
with PWA
haha
i just
clicked
a text field
in the flutter demo app
and it crashed
what is wrong
with pwa
ramesh
i wanna know
also
i dont like
ios
ios
needs
to end
chrome
what about it
pwas
dont work
are not a thing
on firefox
then
dont use
they do work
firefox
congratulations
you have contributed to
vendor lockin
it is not
vender lockin
blink
is open source
android is open source
anyone
can make
anything
based on those
pwas are a standard
that anyone can support
we must support standards
cy is mad
because
apple
doesnt
support
standards
theres this thing called cordova tho
that lets you turn web apps into mobile apps
idk if its any good
but imma try it
cuz i have some experience with it
from the 4H app
which was written in Ionic
and compiled with Cordova
it was not
that good
though
the speed
was
questionable
but
the app ended up on the app store and the google play store
f-droid
cy wanted to know what kubernetes is
it is basically a really overcomplicated docker-compose
cy doesn't know what docker is
cy needs to get his homelab skills in order
yes
what is a homelab
…
look it up on urban dictionary
its like
your servers
at home
yes
wait why did I say look it up
I need to get out of this habit
I should define terms that I know
yes
I'm going to try to fix that
let's see
it's also like
managing those servers
in an interesting way
yes
idk
im more into
making things happen
rather than
like
working with servers
I am interested in
writing programs
to make things work with my servers
Ok
i also dont like
have
A homelab
you do
Is
you have a server
pis count
A lab
That is at home
🤯
its like a lab where you experiment with servers
yes
but not experiment
idk i have a pi
it can also do stuff
and it runs
all my web
infrastructure
so its like
important
In essence
how do you deploy
your web stuff
Is a computer lab
ftp is boring, make a docker registry
and build your services
and then use your private docker registry to run them with docker-compose
idk
i just like
host them
with nginx
or
like
Docker compose is bueno
yes
i should learn how to use docker
I know how to use it but I am going to switch to nix
It’s ez
i was gonna learn about docker
but i never got to it
cuz i didn't need it
Nix docker has its own thing
I’m gonna use that
yeah
idk i am into the idea of just doing
and being done
no docker
I like docker
i wanna try a serverless platform
I kinda need docker
try like
theres a thing thats not heroku
it's self hosted
but not heroku
no
i want something
not
self hosted
because
that is fundamentally
not
serveless
i want to host an app
for low cost
reliably
off site
it isn't
the thing here is that it isn't
since this runs on someone else's server
whos server
heroku's
but then its abstracted
so its not relevant to me
but it is like
not serverless
it's offsite
but definitely not serverless
idk I'm nitpicking
you can ignore me
it will always have a server
but
if its "serverless"
im not paying for
a server
um
you're paying for their server
no
you pay
not for that
you pay for requests
to ur app
unlike paying for a VPS
where its like
ur paying for a vm
which serves stuff
idk
show me a service like that
also I will disappear for a few minutes
I have to do things
Google App Engine
PythonAnywhere
Heroku
don't you love it when your program crashes when you try to run git push
Yes OOM errors are beautiful
song
Yes
I saw that
if you have a study hall
you don't do anything
just go do whatever you want
nice
cy is sad
what is this
even google chrome
has glitches
with filters
aptX
aptX
yes
on lunix
QUALCOMM
does windoze
have aptX
yes
natively
Interesting
because like
Surface Headphones
have aptX
There better be
A snow day tmrw
Yes
I agree
They have to
They cant make excuses by making us go virtual
No they can just make the whole week virtual
Everybody is just gonna be pissed
If they do that
Yes
Give us a break
But they can
Meh idrc
I like Mondays off
I would rather
Tuesday meh
they give us off
like that week in march in 8th grade
when I went to cy's house every day
since it was all snow days
You went to my house?
yes
imagine that happenign
I don't remember that
ill find my hangouts logs
I wish it weren't the pandemic
cy this was in like
2018
Yes
Vaksine
I want
Vaksine
Nix
is a programming language
I see
My dad is gonna force me to shovel snow
now I will modify my config file
idk about my parents
i will tho
look nix is really cool
watch this goes to
Maybe I use nix
Should I set up another pi
For homelabbing
this is wrong
Or should I buy a server
For homelabbing
wait
wtf is wrong with this thing
Don't send reallllllly wide images
They don't appear as images
It's annoying
The aspect ratio must be less than a certain amount
why
Idk
Telegram
Let's switch to Triangle
Once it's in order
I can make it such that it works for all of us
Granted we will actually use it
if it works
there
nixos is building my entire service
from git
bing bang boom
What would it take for you to use Triangle
custom message types
and a very scriptable platform
Other than that
that's it
and like
a decent phone app
Those are both on the plan
that is not a pwa hopefully
react native is fine too
The problem is like
Wait
What if I did Cordova
Would that be sufficient
yes
Like the web app
yes that would be fine
But through Cordova
i want an apk
also firefox support
i want firefox support
The thing is it would be slower
Than a native pwa
fine
but I also want firefox support
It works in firefox
And safari
Well actually there's a ui glitch on mobile firefox
But I can fix it
yes
see you need to fix it
Should I post it on GitHub
So you can contribute
yes
and learn git
Expo Go React Native demos
that works
ramesh destroyed his vm
so we're seeing if it'll load now
from scratch
Dude sudo is way to overpowered
after mysqlbackup was run
U can sudo passwd root
To change the root password
As a user
Ahhh I'm kinda scared
will it work
will it work
will it work
Itll work
nah
no way
my rpi
can kill itself
No hold on
Cats are good
My rpi
Can go kill itself
yeah true
welp
it deleted the database it seems
who
not you
someone else
My brother
uhm
Oh
I figured it out
I think
imma fix this big issue
duolingo
what is yann learning
"lolydodo"
No snow day
ik
its pissing me off
Its so stupid
where do our snow days go?
There are none this year
So if we get them
We lose winter break days
thats fine
winter break passed already
Spring break
ik
Whatever
its a scheme
a conspiracy
they dont wanna give us snow days
this is communism
unjust treatment
*sigh
Maybe they change their mind
what
Hi
Telegram had a group voice channel
If you wanna talk to ppl
has or had
Has
oh
I know it does
I just haven't used it yet
not now
Yes now
yes I want to
but not now
omg
gunicorn
is like
the easiest thing
im worried
that vultr
will be slower
than a raspberry pi
also should i use a local mongodb
for playtools
or should i use Atlas
Atlas is easier
but it uses my bandwidth
but i have like 500GB
and im about to fix the auto-self-ddos bug
someone
is this clear
like
what would you do
if you were "cy from gunicorn"
?
presented with that screen
if your name was "cy from gunicorn"
what would you do
click it
click what
use current name
i see
ok
this was unclear before
idk i cant think anymore
because the lowest button said "Play Video"
so ppl thought
i think doing hw while listening to music is bad
to click play video
not
"use current name"
huh
math, science, yes. English, history, seminar, no.
history with music is doing me wonders
idek what i have typed
in my notes
if we joined a voice call
would akhil join
idk maybe
u wanna join?
ill ask my parents in a few minutes
I can
cool
okay we might then
i just want this h*ckn nix vm to work
then I will get up
encourage ramesh to join a voice call
and ask my parents
IT WORKS
NIXOS FINALLY WORKS
also
I can join
a voice call
join
ok
it no work
my mic
broke
can you hear me
no
Bye
bye
i got it
to work
which is good
note to self: offload caddy data dir to nfs mount
server details
server restart
server reinstall
docean
maybe
theres a
nixos
discord
can you please
set up an iperf for me
so I can see how fast the upload speed is
what do you want again
set up a cheap server or wahtever
on my nextcloud server?
no
on your vultr
no
why
i have limited egress
and ingress
how much is the limit
500GB
yes
and my dad is funding this
im not doing
for one purpose
500GB
of data
i have gigabit
at home
first try that
see this is
also i dont think the vultr is fast enough
what is your iperf
to vultr
to do more than like 700mbps
idk i just got it
i dont even have an ssh key
k fine
ill talk later thaen
what is mtr
some like
packet size or something
idk
i was looking into it
no
that might be mtu
anyway I have work to do
bye
haha nvm
Im wut
on my vultr
2 gigabit speeds
yes
Im done
that was like
the fastest
speedtest
i ever saw
Im done
it was like
u blink
Im done
and its done
I give up
Im over here
With 40 mbps
no this is a vps
Oh okay
Still
Thats fast
a $3.50 vps
the cheapest out there
im spekked out
just me, myself, and my one cpu core
how many gunicorn workers should i run
Yes
they reccomend 2-4
per cpu core
i think imma do 2
do i put my site in /var/www
imma not
its a pain
is officially
online
and fully secure
and
has ddos protection
with Cloudflare™
also
cy is mad
featuring extra slowness™
it is not
working
go to the site
then click
new share
stops
working
vultr slow
no
it goes
it doesnt load
which is the ip of the gunicorn instance
I use gunicorn
and nginx
for emotes
tell me then
how you got this
not to happen
I set the URL
like
there is a way to not have this issue
im seeing
idk
try a reverse proxy
what are all those headers
for
subdomain routing
i am mad
this is not a thing
wait
im thinking why
go to that
thats like
literally
what i have
except im on 81
wait
no its not
what i have
i do not reference a wsgi file
yes
try a reverse proxy
and add those headers
try installing nginx or caddy
i am using
nginx
I think
well but its also doing ssl
yes
caddy automatically
does letsencrypt
k the headers fixed the issue
i should use caddy
yes
sadly I cannot use caddy
i mean I can it'll just be pointless
i want rate limiting
on my site
yes caddy
has that
as a plugin
but is it per-ip
the thing is this
nginx has that
through a not-plugin
like
think about
natively
the number of times
there is a directive
nginx has given you
a headache
many
many
times
Same
unfortunately I have to use varnish
since my vpn is bad
why
oh
the thing is this
cloudflare
will do rate limiting
but
its a pay per request
nvm
caddy has it built in
no but
if you want it
by ip
you have to do it at the top level
which in this case would be cloudflare
that said
no this has by ip
they
no but
to caddy
it would all be coming from cloudflare
so its all one ip
wait
really?
yes
lkasjfdl;kjaf;ljasdfl;kjsaf
if ur using cloudflare proxy
a;sdlfa;sldfk
alskdjfl;asdf;lsakjfl;safj
*sigh
okay
the thing is
cloudflare
"charges"
its $0.05
per
10,000
requests
Perhpas
I also have homework to do though
also the thing is
my app
requres
lotsa requests
mainly what i need
is just database rate limiting
or size-limiting
Try haproxy
like registering a client has to have a delay
or also
i could use
recaptcha
recaptcha v3
If you want
im already using recaptcha
i think
a user
just cannot exceed
like
1000 "shares"
and you require a recaptcha score of 5 or higher to view the shares
meh
ill wait
till it breaks
yes do that
i have to do work
eventually
k
I will do this
why not use cloudflare
are you using cloudflare
because
I cannot forward optimum ports
I think of it as a security risk
wait
what is this for
ill explain later
bye
bye
vultr is still not working
im getting sick
of this
goddammit mongo db
why
why
mongodb
is breaking
why
cy is mad
haha lol
i forgot
you have to
tell mongodb Atlas
to let in certain IPs
or else it will block them
Finally got the hack I gosh fully working POG
ah
he has
a mak
im like
fighting
with mongodb
and nginx
and vultr
and cloudflare
and certbot
and flask
The Mac
and gunicorn
🍎
Put sticker on it so it would blend in
I have a hackintosh too
I gave up on it
Think anyone will notice?
Nope, no one
ramesh
i think
it actually
works now
This was the most painful thing I have tried to do
yes
installing lunix
Z390 boards need to die
would have been easier
uhm
did you use opencore?
how'd you make it work
Yeah used opencore
I was having problems with it restarting randomly and the solution was in the postboot guide at the very end
did you make imessage work?
with the like
setting the ID or whatever
i forget
Idk it kinda just worked automatically
AHHH
I didn’t need to do anything
I spend hours trying to get imessage to work
ASFLKJlj
My iCloud just linked to it
imma try it then
i just did a vm
i just need apple for development purposes
so i can test
But rn I can’t get it to display on multiple monitors
I did this
hi my name is cy
I do maths
and I know
that 0.02+0.04 != 0.04
it has a
dark theme
This is the reason I can't continue with MultiHangman at th emoment
I mean I can it's just that I can't
should I?
Sure
Go for it
Live life
Yes do it
if not you can disable it later
yes
idk if I even have ipv6 support here tho
try it
no
it doesnt
work
theres no ipv6 yet
Verizon is
"testing"
it
in like
virginia
wait
for ipv6
do both the server and the client
have to support it
Yes
Both must support ipv6
I see
does your linode
have ipv6
yes it does
vultr has ipv6
as an option
a free option
so I selected it
im just wondering like
what could i do
with a vps
that only has ipv6
Hurricane electric is interesting
why are there no power outage apis
this is an injustice
why do you need one
to monitor power outages in the area
for yourself?
or as an app
yes for myself
the just use like
the websites
provided
by service providers
but i wanna use an api
hi i like my vultr
*sigh
time to add
more
rate limiting
i have
paranoia
what about
2fa
meh
not needed for this
overkiill
in fact
this service
was going to just be like
oauth?
no accounts
you just
make a share
and then
share it
sign in with google
i could
but
*sigh
ill add that to cygn-in v2
Cygn in with MyKettl
no
only i
can use
Cygn in
you get the
sign in
*cygh
*cysicygh
cy sigh
Mesh Net
RaMesh Net
yes
it's free
and good
do they do serverless
no idc anymore
im just using
vultr
tbh
i still dont understand how you got the word serverless
it is not
without a server
it is
it is without
a server
and it is
a thing
wth is this website
if im not managing a server
its serverless
you are.
no im not
It is simply someone else's server.
they are
its like
so they are installing playtools then
yes
i get cloud computing
i dont get
i give them playtools
"serverless"
they host it
theres no gunicorn
or nginx
or any of that
they deal with it all
they scale it all
so like
instead of upgrading your vps
you just
do
nothing
it just
scales
bing bang boom
yes
literally
no joke
cuz there is no server
ok
i get it
but imma call this PaaS
sure
wait
what are the aas's
as a service
no
like
what are they
theres
IaaS
PaaS
SaaS
vps is IaaS right
infrastructure as a service
platform as a service
software as a service
idk
anyway
I think
idk
serverless might have been nicer
although
idk
i could go with google
but im just worried like
if something goes wrong
Lock-in has entered the chat
the platform is so complicated
that like
trying to fix anything
trying to understand billing
is hell
Heroku
is what you would call
"serverless"
but i was like meh
well
theres also cloudflare workers
but those arent really a hosting platform
also
vultr
vps
will let me install mongodb locally
if i want to
so that's an advantage
yes
mongodb is nonfree software
no theres a community edition
SSPL
is not open-source
what is sspl
server side public license
if you host mongodb
you have to open source
as a service
open source what
everything
that
you use to manage mongodb
and that integrates with it
in any level
or way
um
how would they know tho
you make mongodb server
for usage for others
idk someone tells them
just like you can report gpl violations
no one access my mongodb
only i do
yes
but idk
like
if i didn't tell you
you wouldnt know
Whats been happening here?
yes
if i stole your code
and you didnt konw
but you cant
steal
is it okay
my code
i can
since its closed source
Sspl
Means it gotta be open source
there imma steal this
that doesn't use mongodb
idc
from mongodb's perspective
it is okay to violate their license?
idk what their license is
fine you make a good point
just like
i think it's fine to violate the apple EULA
since it's unethical
I mean u shouldn’t
I mean u shouldn’t
where
idc about apple though
does it say
that its sspl
Its mongodbs like license
They made it
this
is why i do not use mongodb
i see
I would rather not depend
on nonfree services
so I will deal with postgres or mongodb
or
if I want a NoSQL
CouchDB
meh
ill just stick with atlas
also
another reason you should try NixOS
nixops lets you manage remote nix installs as wel
so if I have 5 rpis
I can just manage them with one code repo
wait actuallY/
also idk if u know but u can make a vm of nixos
like whatever system u have currently
yeah I know
I saw it somewhere
but it's only for testing
yea
no
sspl
does not
apply
to me
it doesn't
but
it depends on a program
i am not selling mongodb as a service
that is not in the repostiries
in lunix
because that program
is
"nonfree"
to them
why is it nonfree
SSPL
SSPL is very reasonable
no dont take my software
no
put a fancy layer on top of it
and then
then it's not open source
it's source-available
close source everything
Maybe
Just maybe
you should look up
AGPLv3
and see what that does.
then look up the difference
idc much about these licenses
between AGPLv3 and SSPL.
if they dont affect me
Just give everything an MIT license
Thats what i do
what is the MIT license
Free open source
Everybody can use
No warranties or liabilities
but what about use in other services
Everything goes
I see
I will be licensing emotes under AGPLv3
I don't want people to steal it
It is a good idea
Does github have a AGPl license?
github
is closed source
gitlab is like
No i mean
Does it have an option to license ur project with AGPL
probably
likely
you would be surprised
at how many licesnses
gitea has
that is if it stops crashing
Nice
389 is an LDAP server
hay cy
no
not native
Mattheiu is typing
Is there no tech club today?
wait
idk
oh its an abbreviated day
technically
So no club?
i guess not
Ok
k one more rate limit to put in
playtools
might
actually
be ready
it has a captcha every 4 times someone tries to view a share
i think
its fully sealed
i just need to verify that the api is sealed
and the playerUpdate API
wait
it might be
done
now
hmm
lol i have like 18 tabs open in firefox
and like 70 open in edge
and about 90 in chrome
who is Karina
a Student
who is Aryan
a Student
what is JSON
a Student
hoi oim bri <stop> ish
hoi
jpo
playtools is done
it works
and it cannot be spammed
oh NOW it wants to work
its a Jason file
or not
the bot is still dead
Why is GCP so buggy
wdym
also
vultr's speed test is like
a file
im installing iperf on a gcp
on the free one?
Yes
i see
dont expect that much
also
expect to incur charges
why
i have 300 dollars
of free credit
well then no
and I used
zero of it
so far
this is like
better than linode
i used $0.36 of mine
*slightly
wait
between what and what
is 5mbps
1 sec
it's from my computer to linode
linode is the iperf server
see
but
i think
that's an
optimum
issue
Yes it is
but the thing is
so i dont think
linode vs gcp
is relevant
It is
one sec
I will demonstrate
um
what
how does
how do
you get
6mbps
to a cloud service provider
See this is what I'm not sure on
i think its cuz speedtest does parallel connections
ill try
with WebSockets
iperf with parallel
Hmm
Yes
that's interesting
cuz like
wget
like
that is download speed
directly to my vultr
one connection
its max speed
You get 250mbps
120 MBps
over iperf
to my
linode
do i?
Yes
wait
you can do it again
are you sure?
lemme
set it up
i have gigabit
it's
wait
ramesh
does iperf
do
which way
client to server
it can go both ways
or server to client
no by default
client to server
so upload
yes
lemme run ur iperf command
yes
its hanging
oops
wait
try now
huh
Now
run
that command with
-P 20 -w 128K -V
what does that do
at the end
parallel
so 1gbps
Yes
lemme try single to vultr
yes
Linode is 1.5Gbps with speedtest-cli
down or up
down 1500
up 1372
linode gud
vultr is
2500 down
1300 up
I cannot get vultr
can i iperf your vultr
this was single to vultr
hold on
yeah and my multi to vultr was 1gbps
interesting
now let me try
lol
so like compraable
to linode
aws was actually 1.52
within margin of error
yes
wait
so I will get no benefit here
what about iperf
to my house
30 probably
try it
you have to open tcp port 5201
lemme open port 5201
I was thinking I could VPN to your house and then you can VPN to my VPS and then I can get it to work
this is silly
regardless of anything
you will always be speed limited
yes
also
i wont
do that
since privacy concerns
and stuff
i already have 5201 open on the pi
Okay
so we try that
what is the IP
hmm
do multi
Hmm
scam
what is scam
wait
it was like
36 mbps
multi
now how can I take "multi"
and put it into my VPN setup
what was this compared to
all the rest
like
slightly worse
i see
you were 5.17mbps
and vultr/linode was 6.2 ish
how about multi
also
how much transfer
did linode give you
and how much are you paying them
idk
per month
none
i used the free trial
i get 100 dollars of credit
ok but like
you have a vps
what does it cost
5 dollars
ok
so 1tb transfer
1gb ram
25gb storage
idk
no
i have 512 MB
and 10 gb ssd
but i pay $3.50
per month
hmm
hmm what
wait whaddaya host on Linode
and how much RAM does it use
and can i eat the part you are not using
wdym
you want to use my linode?
no
i wanna know
how much ram
you use
to run your service
115 mb
I see
im using 240 mb rn
the amount used may go up a lot eventually
cuz varnish
wait
this is emotes
right
no
it's
my reverse proxy
ah
vpn thing
how much does emotes use
365M
ah
also
you use Gunicorn
yes
uwsgi is
how many workers
do you set
idk
the default
so 1
should I add more
does your app support doing that
probably
does it store local variables
wdym
like
all programs do
no local to the instance
global to your program
but local to the instance
… yes
for what
cuz you see
my only "local" variable is viewsWithoutCaptcha
which is a non-vital variable
I like
I still don't understand
ok
so
can it be
horizontally scaled
that's another way to put it
what does that mean
ok it means this
you can have 2 servers
running
the same software
and i can ask either of them
any time
randomly
and both are sure to give me a valid response
yes
uhm
no
so if i login
with one server
i can just
go to the other one
and ask for data
and it will give me it
no
emotes does not do that
PlayTools does do that
unless like
the database configuration is the same
no
they share
a database
then yes
and it has to share the same file mount
hold on
ah
i fixed emotesbot
yes
emotes will do that
for the most part
there was like
a really nice diagram
and i cant find it
and i am sad
This
yes.
this
Yes
what about it
it looks fine
I have made these before for myself
it is the nice diagram
with alla the parts
Triangle is gonna have many of them
Yes
my current system has many of them
imma make one
including the Collaboration Server
"what if disney princesses were cement mixers?"
cy has left the chat
what
why
he is back
ima set up a wiki
eventually
what is that
is that ur network
no
it's a drawio template
i should draw a diagram of my network
you should
imma make a wiki
called boringwiki
in like 10 minutes
how should i draw the diagram
in rust
or visio
this isn't quite right
Yes
the media has now forgotten what telegram is
and now everyone will think
telegram is a far-right social media platform
im almost done with my diagram
hi welcome to cy's network
now this is interesting
yes
it is
hi im a raspberry pi
and im using
of ram
yes
I
Really detest varnish
what do you think of my network diagram
It is
very interesting
as in that it's more interesting than mine at the moment
my network is literal spaghetti
That is good
also
eventually
and like the tech blog as well maybe
see everything on my network gets routed through HAProxy
except Mosquitto and OpenVPN
why openvpn
why not wireguard
idk i tried wireguard
and it didn't work
and OpenVPN is good enough
i just need it for those times
when you have to manage infrastructure
from far away
like
calum calls me
hes like
cy
I tried OpenVPN
i wanna work on the wiki
it was a nightmare
pivpn
is not
a nightmare
k nvm
i dont
pi
i use nixos
and im in the car
it takes like 5 lines of code
and its like
ok...
and so
i pull out the VPN
and connect
also
pivpn supports wireguard
i just
havent needed it yet
Hmm interesting
Also
I was thinking of something dumb
what
nvm
it has nothing to do with this
what is it
I wanted to assess how someone would react if I randomly told her "I love you" even though I don't
For the sake of social science
go right ahead
without my affiliation
yes
i mean the thing is
wireguard is easy to set up but then it's like also a pain
once you figure it out it's easy
idk it just
then when you go to fix it it's a pain
i tried it
and
it didnt
work
at all
it was faster
than openvpn
yes
i hear
its like
im making a diagram
and
when you hover
over the logo
it animates
vultr
tony vultr
its david aninowski
he grew up in new jersey
and went to NJIT
then
and founded vultr
decided
to make vultr
yes
did you hear
jeff bezos
yes
I heard
i heard him too
the sound
was one
i did not expect to hear
I didn't
mind
im just happy cuz like
Panos
is now in charge of windows
and Panos
cares
about how things look
i do not care
how things look
tesla
is apple
but
cars
well also
they share
technology
at least
i mean
apple has no technology
elon has a sense of humour
to share
apple
does not
I have
heard that one
before
do you know
how i2c works
no
stop
i2c
is fun
this one is slightly funny
yes
This is like
the future
this is
...
Haha
this one IS good
get it?
…
yes
this is like
funny
also caddy will get replaced with haproxy
i see
next up on the list
UDP streams
for video
what if
i end up making a video chat app
before i make Triangle
what if Triangle has video calling
i was
thinking of making
a voice chat server
with UDP sockets
no video is way cooler
the problem is that like
no UDP in a browser
so ur stuck with TCP
hmm
video call over WebSockets
oh no
actually
websockets
are not that bad
but
WebRTC
is also a thing
which allows you to do RTC over a UDP link in a browser
wait
hold up
hold up
WebRTC
is actually p2p
so like
if we wanna connect
my browser
would establish a link
to yours
directly
well with a server to facilitate the connection
but
the actual data
is being transmitted
p2p
with a relay backup in case the p2p fails
idk
im like
busy
this is really cool
im definately learning about this next
nixos is cool
if I want to add my public key
I just
wait for it
"calligraphy"
cy is still lost
about
webRTC
how does
one
just
"connect"
with a peer
cuz if that is truly how this works
then how do group chats work over webRTC
and also
if that's how it works
i can really cheaply and easily
make
a low latency, high quality, free real time sharing service
since i process no data
maybe
I have no clue here
ramesh is still nixosing
yes
hpX
ignore this
hi ramesh
do you wanna get on a voice chat
and chat
I uh
did that with akhil
lol
And then closed telegram
since telegram voice chat bad
ExpressJS
Oh no
jk
I predicted it
i might use it at some point
Watch
or websockets
Yes
flask-websockets
although
i can just use
the python websockets module
but then the realtime server is separate from the main one
cuz the websockets module uses asyncio
and i only know how it works in that implementation
yknow whats fun
i think zoom
actually uses WebSockets
varnish is caching too zealously
i will deal with this later
wait also cy
try control-f5
no its not slow
its fast
Yay
varnish go brrr
PeerJS
is a server
for handling WebRTC
cy
you know what
cdknight: you know what
you know what
cdknight: you know what
hold on im emailing mr y
we need
inline
not cy
translator
why tho
so I can
translate stuff for akhil
the khiller
but like
why
is that
different
from just like
cyfinfaza: from just like
since
the bot is not in our dms
ah
you want it
in a dm
but then like
you have to
do @bot
then
paste the message
Yes
cuz it cannot see all the messages
that's fine by me
no
inline bot
bots can send messages on your behalf
text messages
yes
but like
you can just like
do google translate at that point
no
also
i dont think inline bots do messages
i think they do media
i think they do
see how
this is text
i see
but like
just
do
no
ill make one then
a TeleKettle
what
is tele
like remote
telegram
telephone
telekettle
C'est la television!
non ce n'est pas
Le teleferique
Watch the tv?
no
it is the tv
Ah
So close
totally
teleferique
cyfinfaza: teleferique
no
akhilvanka: no
voissez
cdknight: see
voissez-vous la television !
cdknight: do you see television!
teleferique
…
i have deployed playtools
and notified my customers
that their service is ready
hmm
can I spam it
i wouldnt
but
it has
protection
that's the point
I want to see if it works
you can test
if you want
it doesn't have much spam protection
おめでとう
its mainly protection on the db
how do I make a playtools
from here
a playtools?
you do
um
paste
a link
じゅsらぱdてあてぃんg
cyfinfaza: Ju s Lapa d Teatin g
no
いtlーをrぉにtslwn
wdym no
아kㅣㄹ st어 ㅍ
oh also
idk if playtools bot works
i think its paired to the old server
akhilvanka: i think its paired to the old server
야ㅏ
idk
Paste a valid YouTube link to create an in-group PlayTools share.
i wanna fix emotes cli
Is it broken?
no
it's just like
really badly written
no
it didnt
work
you have to make a playtools from the actual ui
or
from the api
either that or the bot has hit a rate limit
nope
the api works
i think
i havent tested it
but i dont care much about the api
I must find a quote
hold on i think theres still water in my mic *ppppfffftttt* *pppfffttt*
k i was worried u found it in normal user territory but u were in speshul user territory so its fine
k i was worried u found it in normal user territory but u were in speshul user territory so its fine
oh is it not working because i took out the ram and forgot to put it back in again
well i disagree with kevin
the other issue is that I don't have 2 fast laptops
but you must understand
*cygh
it's the quote
cy is updating windows atm 
then hes 
gonna go to best buy 
and buy RAM 
> and eat it 
yes
no maybe it was in real life
not a quote
what do you search
the thing when I was like
"I make webapps with php and sql"
and cy was like
"that stuff is not interesting to me"
lol

Broadcast Using This Tool
its what the mak ppl are stuk with
Im never gonna use it so
I got a nice vlc for mac tho
iina
cy woke up too late
today
he thought
it was wednesday
which it was
Was a normal day?
yes
Honestly
Look wise
It looks fckin great
Actually drive that
Is gonna be a pain
but
actually
dont
drive it
cuz it drives
itself
Yes it drives itself
Akhil
can i blow ur mind
Idk i would want to drive the car
Sure
So clients can only talk to servers right
Um what
Like
if i make a website
the clients
get the website
from the server
and transfer data
to and from the server
I mean yes
now meet WebRTC
Where the clients
talk to
the clients
without
talking
Nice
to the server
im like
what
how does
how the h
So what it gets it from another client?
Like torrenting?
somehow
2 clients
establish
a direct link
to each other
with no config
on the router
like
literally
in a browser
hole punching
2 clients
look up
hole punching
imma do something else rn
bye
but before i go
adieu
ill just put this here
Akhil
make one
so akhil can see
i made one too
its my network
Why is everyone making one
cuz its what kool kidz do
yes
:D
What software?
Google draw?
or whatever
Fine
there
👏
that's like
you are larger
than optimum
you can do it
yes
yes
note that there is no connection to the internet
thats on purpose
lol
its starlink
on LTT
i want
actually tho
like
yes
u want
i think i already signed up for the beta
well i mean i think you can actually get 5g internet here
hold on
cough
there
not here
um
there is tmobile 5g here
not verizon
although like
even 4g upload speeds
are faster
than optimum
like
i was with akash
and like
his upload
was
500 kbps
yup
but on 4g
1990s
it was 20 mbps
haHAA
so like
we just used
his phone
as hotspot
like
seriously
what is it
with this
wait
akhil
do they have poles
in the hills
or is it underground
Yay I got a 403
akhil is walking to the window
to look
for poles
what
like
polish people?
no
not Poles
poles
if u no have poles
do not expect
fast internet
for a while
what?
telephone poles
underground
ah yes
you see
and there is no fiber underground
in the hills
so
they need to install fiber
yea thats kinda the reason
and i think the hilliness of the hills
makes it hard
my dad told me about running fibers underground
cuz like
his business
is fibers
he makes
fibers
idk
wait
but then
what about
B days
wait
what
Idk
Its under daily announcements on the website
meh
so that means
i dont go to skool
its rich rebuilds
this video is
fun
I recommend it
yes
I did that over winter break
Cleaning in progress...
nice
I think imma have to go further than this tho
To get all the dust and stuff out
Idk I'll see
I like have barely any homework today
satisfaction
Optimum is stupid
So now i cant access router settings
Again

Just take of the keys that have the screws under them
yes
i just have to find where they are
but actually
the keyboard is like
a little nicer

without those screws in
especially the space bar
Really?
yeah a little

++++++++————————————……………….0000000.
.2..0...……..0000000000000000000000000000000000
found it
fixed it
now just 2 more screws
on the back
tf
ive been doing this
since
2:45
th
ive been banging my head since 1
about what
i wanna port forward
but cant
then be like ramesh
and route everything through aws
i might have to
or vultr
vultr is cheaper
at that point i might as well just run the service on a vultr or aws thing
well
but if you need like
storage
thats true
or cpu
or
i mean
if u dont wanna pay much
you can use the free google vps
yea i may have to do that
the thing is this
if you go for like
not aws
or google
or microsoft
rn i might as well set up pfsense
the transfer fees are much different
like
vultr's $20/mo instance
gives you 3TB of transfer
per month
and
huh
3TB of transfer
costs
$270
on aws
so you're effectively getting $270 worth of transfer
each month
and only paying
$20
huh
and like
vultr's
$3.50/mo one
has 500gb
which is worth $47
on amazon
if you see where im going
but
yea
the big three
charge less for compute
i believe
like
google
gives you it
free
literally
free
the $3.50 instance on vultr
only counting compute
is 100% free forever
on GCP
but
egress is $0.12 per GB
additionally
the big 3 do not charge for ingress
so cut those numbers in half
because vultr includes ingress
in your allowed budget
so for your application
Huh
you're only getting $23 worth of transfer
on the $3.50 vultr
but
that's still
really good
Yea
that said
like
check how much transfer you use
cuz if you dont use that much
use the google f1-micro
which is the completely free one
cuz like
if you use less than 29.16 GB per month
its more cost effective
yea its def more than that
how much
what is the purpose
rn i need pfsense and an email server
what is pfsense
its like firewall/router stuff
what does it do
and why is it so data intensive
thats not the intensive
if i run my server through gcp its prob gonna go over 30 gb
why tho
how does an email server
use more than 30 gb
this is my entire server so thats torrents, music
wdym your entire server
you are hosting
torrents
and music
if i do what ramesh does
^
if i actually just host an email server on gcp its probably gonna be fine
lemme just say
according to cloudflare
in the past 30 days
of which were cached
huh
so in actuality
only 2gb of transfer occurred to my server
so technically
if i hosted those on google
i would be paying
$0.12 per month
but instead i host them at home
and pay $0.00 per month
but u cant do that
but u get the idea
Yea
Idk im gonna try making this work
It worked before
what
what work
optimum?
Accesing my router settings
Yea
k
although
i dont think they do port 25
but im not sure
Yea ik
But 587 works
Which is another smtp port
So it should be fine
i see
ok
wait i take back what i said
you would actually get 1tb total transfer
since with a vpn
your ingress and egress would be almost equal
but they only charge for one
the higher one
on vultr
for gym
i picked
yi jian mei
and some kpop song
hey cy
do you have a docean droplet
no
why
i wanna
iperf
but like
hold on
wait
JP has one
Yes
I used to have access
SSH access to his
just ask him
to iperf
He stopped using it
A long time ago
i see
we shut it down
use their speedtest tool
they like
dont have one right
they do
I still have a backup of the database from our droplet
what were you using it for
envoyez-moi
matrix server
i see
btw
we are learning stuff in calculus
and it's like
telling me how people make CAD software
and...?
it's interesting
i could write my own
i see
what
like
forensics
extemp
no
extemporize
means
to do something
without preparation
improvise
varnish zealously caches stuff
what about some element
on the periodic table
radeon
not radon
radeon
the technical term for too much in programming is zealously
adenosine
tri
phosphate
ah yes
scalpers
im allergic to biology
yourself
also haha imagine ever taking an sat subject test
i never did
you never did
i thought
you studied for it
no
akhil maybe
I never took biology
and this was during normal times
so I am lucky
biology was fun
yes it was
i sat in the back
probably my best class
ever
and read fiction books
i got like an A
and i didn't study
at all
I got like an A-
and i was interested
and studied only the night
before the test
they also made a rounding mistake
A- A- A- B- is actually a B+
but nooo they gave me an A- anyway
um
they round up
always
whatever
this is a class
Ah
The famed A+
The unattainable
yes
Its real
the class where
I
The stories
The legends
They were true
The class
where my final average was this
in 9th grade
Ah
seminar
The famed B+
lol APCSA
oh
I got like a 99%
lol APC
The famed APCS
The unattainable APCS
no
APCAB
that class is APCAB
Ah yes
Okay imma go back to depression
mailcow
ok imma finish this homework
Well it works
No i need le ports
yes
And alot of them
get an AWS
I would need like 8 seperate tunnels
get
vultr
I may
or the free
GCP
Prob vultr
why
Idk
Seems nice
also google gives you $300 free credit
Guess im with google
theres nothing there
i need a domain
what do i choose
y
do you need another domain
if someone wants another domain
now i must haproxy with intelligence™
also vultr is on speedtest
oh
but its not as fast on speedtest as it is with iperf
lemme see
i have to install it
downloading…
that upload speed is a lie
FVLibraryAdminClient
this is literally
not
i thought this was a drone picture
*cygh
no
its where
my vultr is
I may still
akiru is bad
Yes
i think godaddy killed this guy's account
he used some sketchy means to buy it
its a $20 a yeary
ramesh no pay
what is this
full of expletives
yeah I think it's this
maybe this one
O
who's coming to rcsc?
yes
seminar
what about csc
Chao, Elaine.
Idk
china
except
its not china
west
brook
hmm
idk any westbrooks
i only know a cy eastriver
u spelt ur name wrong
Haha
was about to make the same joke
cy is very tired
he like
had to walk
for an hour
in the snow
hes sorta dizzy now
cyze at komp cy
yes
i saw
a keel is not
i will be
y'know
i left
because my parents are arguing too loudly
and I don't feel like sitting here when my parents are arguing
may i ask
why
werkzeug
is better
than Gunicorn
you are
comparing
apples to oranges.
if i spam my gunicorn server
on vultr
it dies
and hangs
if i spam my werkzeug server
on my pc
but through cloudflare
ah
it's because
it just like
doesnt
hang
your computer
is not a potato vps
ok but im monitoring the cpu and ram usage of the vps
the cpu never goes over 20%
ram?
disk?
and the ram has gone down
over the course of this test
uhm
what does gunicorn say
make more workers idk
i have 2 workers
on flask i have threaded=True
for werkzeug
add like
10 workers
see what happens
im testing things
I wish
my VPS
ran NixOS
why cant it
it's a pain
to set it up again
i dont wanna use up my credits
i mean if I do
cant i just make another account
why not use vultr
ozarka
it
refuses
cards
Ozarka
nope
i wanted to use pointers
it wont work
but
no
it works
that is not a pointer
rust does not have pointers
yes
it is not
rust only has references
a pointer
what is a pointer again
an address
is it like a mutable reference
in memory
yes
but references are also that
right
idk
i dont use references
i gtg bye
*sigh
bye
if anyone is still awake
i have lost my mind
*i think
yup
i had lost my mind
it said
and i read
so they changed it to "Apple"
My computer refuses to let me log in
Which is a bad
Oof
Its snowing
Hard
Yes but my computer wont work
why
I fixed it
without doing anything
ms tan says
she would
"gladly use"
cydingbat
Make it
it may be time
I could also collaborate if you want
yes
a collaboration
always good
2x speed
well more like 1.75x speed cuz theres coordination overhead
Ytteribum
Itterbium
hmm
how would we go about
making
codingbat
i think you just make a user
that cant
access anything
then you use Microsoft Monaco
uhm
I would use docker
no but
what if
Yes
like
with python
someone runs
you cant escape a docker cy
os.system("rm -r")
it cant
my point is this
they could
Docker cant delete the OS
I finally made
break the docker
haproxy work
then you make a new one
but like
health check
they can keep breaking it
rate limit them
no
you need
a way
to have them be unable to access anything
ill think about it in a bit
um
i have
apush
like go into coding bat and try and break it
it doesn't break
lol codingbat just blocks the import command
wait
wait
hold on
what if
we used
webassembly
yes
cuz you know you can make webassembly compilers
python has a webassembly runtime
so whats to say java cant have one
hmm
yes
but no
that is a pain
yes
but then
how
im looking for implementations
and i cannot find
dont do that
use replit
good luck implementing swing
with wasm
i mean heres the thing
how to run code on a server
hi ppl
how do you do
i do
i do too
ramesh
hi
do you wanna make a codingbat clone with me
Yes
in rust
i mean
what part of it
would be rust
the container manager
but like
then I will make a python api
also
and you can then
wrap over it
also
my rust thing will be like
look at codinbat
see how fast
the code runs
yes I know
i think
its interpreted
not compiled
in codingbat
no
import rustlib

output = rustlib.execute(java_code)
um
ok...
to do checks
you could like pass a closure
output = rustlib.execute(java_code, lambda x: execute_right_function(x))
but then you have to write the answers in python
output = rustlib.execute(java_code, correct_java_code, test_inputs)
idk something like this
does python have this
this would make this VERY easy
you could run j4rs in a docker container
hmm
idk
i like rust
i think
if you disable the ability to import
anything
but like
math
I don't want that
I want docker
and arraylist or whataver
so you can do whatever you want
ramesh
what if
someone
breaks
the docker
how
tell me
how
by running a command
that breaks it
1) you can restrict the interpreter
and prevent them from running anything
if they find a way around that
you kill the docker container
and spin it up again
it takes like 2 seconds
what if someone else is in it
compiling code
it
makes
a
new
container
for
everyone
but like
isnt there
overhead
per container
also you don't have to use docker you can something lighter
not much
docker is rather light
i should learn about docker
try podman or something
or you could literally use chroots
there are lots of solutions
yes
oh also
disable networking
Its lighter if u add alpine into it
no
Idk how to do that yet
even ligher
Ive seen podman
I wanna see what it’s about
my problem is that i have no place to test something like docker
i do
Ur computer
my desktop
since it runs lunix
i have 600 mb of space
on my desktop
try it on a server
pis can run docker
but my pi is running everything else
U can def get an nginx container up
i could get like a vm
in virtualbox
and run stuff there
I mean u could
i could boot into Linux
but that's a pain
yeah do that
its a pain tho
i have to like
Make sure u get compose
i think a chroot might work
i think so too
Docker by itself is nice, compose makes it better
also what about jvm
or whatever
Kvm?
no
jvm
java virtual machine
or whatever
no
jvm has access to the overlying system
can i boot my linux ssd as a vm
I think it would be easy to use like podman
yes
use hyper-v tho
how
add it as a disk
hmm
to your vm
i would have to enable hyperv
yes do this
also I think we could make a reallllly light podman with no networking or shell access
and then run all the processes
if they do "rm" it will throw a command not found
i see
And
you can have like runtime containers
so the containers dont actually story code
so if someone actually does destroy the container somehow
it will just send it to another runtime contianer
therefore you dont need hundreds of containers
and then you load balance the different containers
we might have to write this in go
this
exists
you can literally configure it
at the JVM level
theres probably more
loading
loading
cy is getting a headache
why
webassembly
is being
a pain
in the tukkus
its like
the kode is there
but its like
no
you cant
do anything
cuz its
more than 4KB
so
you have to run this function instead
so i run it
this wont work
and it tells me
like
and i have no clue wtf that means
like
at all
cy is mad
the function runs
but
all
the values
are
0
*sigh
imma eat food
make
java
Cy do you want to make java
Wdym
You mean cydingbat?
yes
but I have to write the backend backend
with docker
and then you can just build on that
U will have to explain to me
How ur backend works
I will
I'm eating rn
Bye
bye
I think I could make the runtime server work by today
It just has to compile the class
add it to the classpath
would you like to call
and then exec it
yes
I can call you
k
wait
just
one moment
sure
brb
brb
um
ok
I like
actually got it to compile
ramesh
i can call for like
13 mins
uhm
not no
also
you dont need to
liek
use javac
what do you use
Reflect.compile
what is that
I'm looking
Use jOOR
You can add dependencies
to r4js
no
j4rs
which should i use
havent used google dns
use cloudflare
ppl like it
wait
oh you mean
for dns resolution
yea
still cloudflare
maybe with google as a backup
or your isp/router as a backup
yea
does chrome have this
what
how
edge is fun
im sad
that it doesn't
work
the fanciest button yet ™
heretofore there has never been a button this fancy
periodic table but the elements are webassign checkboxes
Ah yes
We have a test on this stuff tmrw
yes
i should
study
Idk if its gonna be ez or hard
It looks like its gonna be ez
Ill check it out later
yeah it no work on mobile
ramesh and i have been working on it
a lot
I still
have to implement a custom class loader
ugh
no longer libreoffice
just libreoffice community
Wait when was that due
Today
By the end of the day
oops
i dont like it when teachers make homework due at odd times
like if its period 1-4
then sunday midnight ok
but like
per 5-9
Bruh u were supposed to have ur vid done on Friday tho
and like dr p
makes things due like
saturday
midnight
right
ill do it
i have to do 3 things then tonight
French things, half the AP seminar TMP presentation, and science studying
also matthew
Tbf
Science is super ez
yeah
Its all on the periodic table
U could get a 100 without studying
i mean
if i ask u
order these 3 elements by ionic radius:
Boron, Zinc, and Sulfur
I dont have my table
idk im too disorganized and distracted frankly
Boron, zinc, sulfur
Isnt that the order
Smallest to largest
i mean
boron sulfur zinc
Im trying ti figure out how to read this chart
i did the french
now that is done
i liked Sherice's response to what her ideal city would be
she said
myself
population of one
so i asked her how she was gonna connect to the internet
cuz what else would i ask
when someone says they wanna live secluded in the middle of nowhere
lol French not done
font is
different
i accidentally
set my firefox global font
to lexend
lol
so now
DM Sans / DM Mono
wait let me find a way to cause an error
is what i have CodeTools set to
lol
lexend
yes
maybe imma change that
to something
liiiike
and that's all it is
it says im maggie
and i could take a better one
finding the balance
no there will not be an api
i knwo
the font
meh
mak
apple
meh
js
google wrote something in nix
nah it's not official
sad
who looked at CodeTools this morning
me
k
y
idk
also are you going to make codetools open source
idk
perhaps
You should
people can like
contribute to it
if they have an incentive to
for example I could add vim keybinds support to monaco if I wanted to
which I probably do
Or if someone like finds a problem with it they can fix it for you
that is true
then my code has to look good
or else people will come
I mean
you can improve it over time
and hold me accountable
for bad code
they really won't
lol ramesh
I mean maybe this is since
Usually my code is pretty decent in quality
since I hold myself to an unusually high standard sometimes
remember this conversation
Yeah
I mean
you should use an object relational mapper instead of manual mongo queries
or
well it's not relational but mongo still has an ORM
idk this is my first time with databases
this template
I have been doing databases since like 7th grade
but like
in a bad way
you could literally sql inject someone
and destroy their server
you cant sql inject me
Yeah
since you use mongo
mongo injection
but my later SQL programs cannot be inecjted
like
emotes
the thing is
what im doing is working for me
although
it can be a pain sometimes to sit and write queries
object relational mapper
Mongoid on ruby
idk what is the advantage
how much more do i have to do
compared to how much
i save
idk
for future projects
also what feature need to be added to codetools
wdym
like
what features are missing from codetools
right now?
like
yes
everything?
other than writing and running
and even those are incomplete
haha
the thing is
you can write and run
i think you should make
but like
it
format the output
not safely
it needs rate limits
what i need
is an auto rate limiter
for my database
so i dont have to go and instate all the rate limits myself
so i could just like
add a rate limit property
but
haproxy
i think
i can come up with a way
to do this
no
rate limits
like on playtools
on the my account page
uhm
well I am not adding that to JRunner5 so you have to do it
no imma do it
the rate limits prevent ppl from spamming
and filling the database
with nonsense
that way i can use the 500mb free cloud hosted mongodb
*sigh
this is another problem with it
what if
I don't
want to use
the free cloud hosted mongodb
wdym
what if
I want
then dont
to use my own mongodb instance
then install mongodb
and then
edit the code?
and switch the connection string
i mean you have to do that anyway
so what are you going to do
when you put it on github
replace the connection string with <connection string>
then
what happens if you like
push it again
tell ppl to make a mongodb
it will get overwritten
i could make it an environment variable or whatever
yes
maybe you should do that
that's what emotes does
whats happening
hi akhil
howdy do
i took chem
es bueno
ready player two is good
read it
ok ok ok
worth reading
should i read it
i read the first one
i will after i get some projects finished up
i will after i get my life finished up
i literally have like
0 time
how
ive been chillin
i spend my time on like
i have too
CodeTools
doing homelab stuff
yu[
I may not work on JRunner5 more until later
should i just make them all ubuntu or try getting alpine to work
get alpine to work
it is a pain
but it'd be worth it
it is a pain
hmm ig
or you could use
they are connecting
um
i mean
technically i could
vultr works with nixos apparently
should I?
its kinda stupid to do it that way tho
its more like allocation at that point
i can
do it
its not hard at all
cause i have everything else set up
its just a matter of, will nixops keep the configuration when it is done?
cause i dont wanna keep doing the script over and over again
wait
this could work
I  have to work
somehow
bye
try it
cya
ill try it
what does this do
its a glitter pen
Mrs Baker really likes her glitter pen
haha
lol
ah
irony at its greatest
do you watch techmoan
i do
i do too
one of the few channels I watch
I see
HAHA
i like that
video
there are more on that channel
time to watch
rich rebuilds
there is not enough racial diversity in what i watch
or gender diversity
I mean
you just watch what you want
I don't really care about the diversity
implicit bias tho
since I don't have any
and the algorithm
meh
implicit bias is really hard to deal with
but essentially
only watch what you like
and dont not watch something on the basis of race or gender
why should i
im worried my parents will yell at me for watching women
ramesh
hi
I know that's not true
I can't do anything about it
no
ramesh
you must
not
*sigh
our past observations dictate our current fears
Rich Rebuilds is good
mm
also you tell me
nothing
almost nothing
interests me on youtube
I don't watch much there
so what exactly am I going to watch that concerns gender diversity
^^timestamped
I don't
car
especially not appl car
its literally like
not that
idk
I used to watch
these
things
imma watcha video
bye
monospace
?
monoscpace
it was not
monospace
before
right
or am I insane
it was not
until
i changed
it
but only the solutions have changed
all the rest of the ui is still sans-serif
do not
use
monospace for UIs.
ever.
ok we are done
the ui
is not
monospace
its DM Sans
and the monospace is DM Mono
do you know how to tell if someone is french
online
um
maybe
just see if they add spaces after question marks and exclamation marks
ah
do you do that
when typing french
no
je vois !
i know
i know it's not vois
are you gonna do it?
no
btw racism is a joke according to louis rossman
i like

a lot
my dryer broke
my dad says it like
buzzed
and
melted
Ha
Are you getting a new won
no probably not
it was bork when we moved in
so we call a gie to fix it
so we kall the gie agen
hopefully the transformer is not
to the board
its an older dryer
well
older than the washer
Haha
i think the washer is like 2013 model or something
the dryer is 2006 i think
although idk what the deal is with this washer
that beeping noise
is slightly relaxing
i like it
but i dont think its relaxing
that machine makes lots of other noises
that are more relaxing
like the one for turning off
or turning on
Ah right to repair
Thats an intresting topic
tis
Cause honestly its kinda useless over here
wdym
Right to repair benefits certain people
Like farmers
Thats the best one i can think of rn
the deal with right to repair
is that
you should be able
to repair your stuff
when it breaks.
without going to the manufacturer
repair should be its own business
and companies are not allowed to monopolize it
Well thats why farmers is the best party this affects
nixvm
should be resistant

is fun
win dot, win v, win h
very useful
why
is your keyboard
so large
win v is the best
i use it like
alla time
ery day
clipboard history
with no extra steps
needed
i have gotten used to like
copying something to clipboard
then overwriting it
and then
just using
I
win v
ƒ
huh
yeah but this requires no setup
its just like
win v
and it works for images
i mean i dont ever overwright my clipboard
so is good
it lets me copy 2 things
like if im on stackoverflow
and i want 90% of their code
but not the 10% in the middle
i think images are supposed to work
but they don't
also it shows up right where the cursor is
which is nice
so its really fast
ƒ
lets see what do i have for homework
imagine
having so much hw
i have none
i
that's just for 5-9
have a little
i mean ill prob do apush notes
but yea
a lot of my work is for AP sem
among other things
lemme try and finish it before 2am
i can work on CodeTools then
in fact what i should really do
is find the thing i least want to do
and do it
format
the output
nixos is docker
it is
but for an os
literally not
can you
program yaml files
well a more complicated version since its for os
ejulastic
i did my kem kwiz
stuck
Sy's Semi Scalable Starter Site Scheme
ah
just press a bunch of keys
itll give u prompt after a few seconds
i got it
it had a dumb error
im fixing that
nice
my systemd service was faulty
what do u use systemd for?
uh
services
like
autostart
autoshutdown services
you really need to read up on a linux book
I recomment
i have a reallly old verison of this
but it taught me everything
teakettl is now dark mode
i do not
like
that
dark theme
its like
low contrast
find a better one
ill install it
you can write your own gitea themes
where are themes
i need this plex theme
that one's not bad
idk how to download this
galaxy buds make a fun noise when they reach 0%
in class on zoom
with only the right earbud
but even when im using both
the right one just like
is lower
i think they are variable master-slave
and the right one defaults to master
ah the feature i was waiting for
in the dev tools
that shows you which codecs your headphones support
Ah
gitea is run by chinese companies
and the gitea instance is literally in chinese
My mom wants a Zeiss microscope
i now own "foo"
loading takes a whie
maybe you should varnish
im using cloudflare
i think
it takes a while
maybe
add this to codetools
i think that's a you problem
it took me like
0 time
it caches after the first load
yes and i did the first load so
^
i would except like
its semi-broken in firefox
it works for me
yes
no it is very broken
idk why
actually its also broken in chrome
when you resize the window
i mean i made it in like 15 minutes
so like
I feel like
Idk
i still haven't figured out my kettl design
lol heres another problem
haha
although i think i can like
find when the mouse leaves the page
and remove them
the main issue is that i need a div
that covers the whole screen
and that breaks for some reason
oh i think i know why
if you have one big div
that extends past the screen
and is set to align senter
also
then this middle div
what software did you use
to make the cy2 logo
Inkscape

yeah
it's not
fancy
hi ppl
go to a website that does not have a security policy or whatever
then go to the console
and paste this:
oh also the site has to be dark theme
cuz the mouse only works with that rn
also you can add parameters to createFancyMouse()
it like
glitches
where are you
ffx
send link
oh you mean the pointer
reappears
wait no its when you scroll
i wanna make the kettl homepage be like
idk if you actually want it you have to make your site not break with it
a ps2 menu
yes
exactly this
this has improved
hi cy i think i broke playtools
ok...
lemme
make a share
um
you put spaces
as the username
and the title
yes
dont you love that
i mean
i assume
the teacher
will not do as you did
cygh
i wonder what happens if I ddos playtools
dont do that
how do i get to the api
you search for the screenshot
i sent
cygh
nvm
im
i have work
me too
also
were there any
codetools updates
no
k
are you going to like
show this to mrs. tan tomorrow
i am
i will be there two
since
I wrote some of it
k
hi ramesh
hi
i
slep
i may show her it rn if no one stays in the main room
haha
do that
I will stay there two
ppl r like
not leaving
yeah
i left
if you make codetools
open source
I would probably contribute
jfyi
wait what did mrs tan tell you after i left
um
nothing
i was talking to someone else
k
what would you contribute
other than like
jrunner5
are you trying to tell me you would actually do web frontend
maybe
maybe I would do the backend stuff
the thing is I don't know mongodb
there is not that much backend stuff tho
its like
all one file
I would see
what I could do
and maybe do some dumb fixes
small things that you can't get to
pen-testing
and maybe
just maybe
I would
format the output
lol
Jinja2
no
this is all client side rendered
no
not all
i uhm
the editor, the arguments, and the results
are client side rendered
i have a history discusison
bye
bye
time to do homework
apparently these icons are data i dont own
a;sdlkfj;alskdfjhomeowkr
pa fỗ
ot
no
basfd
it no hav search
if you want to add search
it bork
no search
lol "it no hav search"
implemented
i have to do French hw bie
feel free to add
to that file
Cy
you like finding out what websites use
what does apple use
Apache
bye
no
what
language
are their stuffs written in
I would assume proprietary protocols and stuff
Or like objective c
no
it's java
i think
imessage server uses .woa extensions which means java
"disturbing copypasta"
WHOS WATCHING THE TRIAL
not me
not me
nice
i dont think it's really started yet
i gotta get spanish done quickly and do worldbuilding somehow
i gotta make a culture and make toponyms as well
can I do it for you
honesty if u want
ive
done it before
jfyi
like
fantastic
ive already built the world in my mind
the thing is idk if I feel like sharing
u dont have to
"integrity protection mechanisms"
"Akhil Genuine Advantage"
ah
yup
i can honestly to all the territories and landmasses and stuff
ports ships thats all really easy
its toponyms
those r cancer
what else do you do in HUG?
politics, government structures, population, cultures umm urbanization
in terms of projects this is like the one kinda fun one
im prob gonna replace a country
so its either the entire British isles, austria, poland, turkey or i might make a country between France and Germany engulfing belgium switzerland
if i make one toponyms is kinda easier
cause i have to just blend the regions cultures together
interesting
also
wt F is this
I am not
I have NOTHING to do with this
damn u were working on the software bus network for NASA
thats sick
i
literally have NOTHING to do with this
how
the
wow
you would need to know how to connect it
ho
and improve chances of success
although yes i was half in the frame
literally how
idk
Ah.
ah
but they were stupid
i took their name
haha
good job
Google:
Prix Houston == Pre-execution
Im having trouble deciding each one
Turkey
Really good spot for trade
yea
thats not bad
i also narrowed it down to denmarkl
viele oar
many islands
in german and swedish
omg the funniest thing just happened
im like about to click submit on a playposit
what
and then
right as I click
i hear dd-dum
from windows
my mouse
crashes
before
oh no
i lift
my finger
from the button
so
HAHA
so the button is just held down
until my mouse restarts
and reconnects
its like
right when i click
its like earlier today
first my icons went
and then
a black box appeared on my screen
and then a blue one
and then a white one
and then
chrome literally becomes this
Ah
and then
my computer starts to refuse to work
im on a call
and im like
i wanna restart
and the restart button wont work
fun times today
Yes
akhil did you see
this
ow wait
ur on mobile
no im not
is a fancy cursor
is
yes
its those cool interactive ones
yes
it is
i will make it a simple js library
to the bottom of your site
and that's all
it does all the DOM appending
CSS modification
and interval setting
for you
also it does the auto dark mode for you
which it does not do yet
also on that site you can change the effect factor
replit^^
YES
Thank god
thing is i dont use vim or emacs
but i thought you terminal people would like to know
Ive been using vim
Its nice
the irony
the world is full of irony
“The Story of an Hour” by Kate Chopin is worthy of inclusion in the canon of great American literature, because it demonstrates the unseen opportunity that women may find unmarried, through beautiful use of imagery and irony.
Nice pun
Is it even called a pun?
is trump gonna be banned from reelection
Idk
these ppl are like
saying
Ive been drawing japan
that trump's lawyers were like
really incohesive
and rambling
Um
They ain’t good lawyers then
its kinda hard to like
argue for him tho
True
Telegram’s gonna get banned
from what
For having the sticker
apple supporter ^^
should i do my homework
Yes
k
Diffusion launched there are 6 hours.
Huh
Imagine being me
And doing more than u should have
Thinking about doing homework there are 5 hours
I use vim
what does that mean
nothing
k
those repbulicans typically
you know the irony
cross the line
the irony is that
stop
bad
today
i have like
5 hours of hw
I do too
but i might actually get to like
work on CodeTools
mm
you know what is also ironic
?
the fact that this weekend
i probably will be working on my homework at like
2am
on tuesday
i like french
ramesh
translate that
directly
wait
i wanna see what google says
Diffusion lancée il y a 6 heures
cyfinfaza: Broadcast started 6 hours ago
ok
oh my god google spell check in french
it like
gives blue lines
and when you correct it
it gives you a red line
because what it suggested
is wrong
so then it wants to switch it back to what it was
but then in doing that
it makes the blue line again
and then it starts recursively generating more squigglies
so when you fix one
5 more appear
and when you fix those
suddenly you spelled something wrong
damn
did u switch the doc language from english to french?
i usually have to switch it to spanish for it to worl
no it auto switches which is nice
quotidian
the quotidian homework
peuvent
peuhvv
huh
telegram = kgb?
no officer its fine
i didnt mean it
apparently
VK
is used by the russians
for DDOSing ppl
since its the 14th most visited site in the world
they can just like
put a ddos node in each client
and then have the clients perform ddos
huh
on who they dont like
thats smart
its like
what PlayTools was doing
to itself
ah right
apparently tho
Durov then left Russia and stated that he had "no plans to go back"[38] and that "the country is incompatible with Internet business at the moment".[37]
good job
oof russia
you are
"not compatibile with the internet business"
atm
in russia they r still using bartering as a form of payment
pavel durov's 26th birthday
why is that the image on wikipedia
Wikipedias a weird place
This looks like imovies
Default overlay
yes
it does
Es bueno
Im dying
Why is government policy so damn hard
Whatsapp is still 2nd?
akhil
whatsapp
also
what I dont get is like
what is that down chart arrow
under the #1
wait
that arrow
means
"trending down"
according to
Yea i was about to say
Its prob refrencing that its been fading
^^ most reliable source
Or doesnt have as many downloads as last week
Tf is that walkie talkie app
lol
Ya know apple watch has a built in walkie talkie
Would u rather pay no money
Or 400$
on google play its #17 in all apps
Thats surprisingly high
that said like
idk how these charts work
Ah yes
Robinhood
cuz like
GME
CBS sports or whatever has like 10M
downloads
but
YouTube has like 5B
Huh
i think these are just trends
no
this is bad
why is AmongChat not higher
huh
so signals always been higher than telegram
i think
wait thats 2020
that
"signal"
no one knows about telegram
is a more popular term
or that as well
idk
see telegram has to do what reddit did
during the superbowl
reddit made a 5 second ad
it was awesome, but u couldnt read it
but that gets exposure
i see
i just looked at it
"our whole marketing budget"
dude ads are expensive
reddit is made with Python
superbowl ads go for like 4 million
really?
thats cool
lol reddit dev tools
holdup
how is reddits salary
lol
i dont think it will be much imo
like not as much as a software dev somewhere else
im thinking a solid 75k
ah vanish
lol
yes
i found a sheet of glass
it is the best thing ever
what
i found a sheet of glass
like good glass
its the glass from a scanner
ah
i have several scanners
that is nice glass
it is very
optically
clear
ikr
its so nice
ive been using it as a tracing thing rn
i set my phone light under the glass
akhil 💚 his piece of glass
paper above the glass
i can now trace things
with super nice accuracy
I see
i have this like
lab glass window
its the nicest glass
its like a lens
but
it is not a lens
its just
glass
yes
and it has a matte finished chamfer
the world needs better glass
what
nice
am i seeing glass?
its corning
they make glass
it is awful
no akhil
this is the only company
that is allowed
to use a such logo
fine
i will allow it
cause they actually make some decent glass
my dad's company
they also make glass
my dad is like cy
i need to go pull a preform
u mean
cy is like cy’s dad
wait
what
wait
no
this
he brought a preform home once
it was a bad one tho i think
cuz preforms are really expensive
those r cool
he makes fiber
his company was trying to sell to verizon
this technology
that allows them to place 5G mmWave nodes
directly on suspended fiber cables
that way they dont have to buy property
they can just use the fiber cable property they already have
this one time my dad comes home and hes like
cy
I have been yelling all day
because I was at the furnace tower
and I had to yell to the person at the top
oh god
because the furnace is so hot it releases enough EMI
that no wireless comm works
and they were not gonna run ethernet up there
huh
interesante
in fact
he had to yell
to a relay
who yelled
to the operator
my dad is interesting
he enjoys sitting and solving algebra
*standing
ah yes
huh
my mom got him a standing desk
i wanted to build a standing desk
like a movable one?
yea
motors and all
actually
the non motor ones are more expensive
and better
cuz they go faster
huh
well for good ones
like slideing ones?
yeah
huh
cuz in order to hold lots of weight
and not use gearz
idk how they do it
they have standing desks at school
i may look into it
in the AP sem room
and make one
i really wanna get a standing desk
the ones in the AP Sem room are mechanical
but they dont hold much weight
i mean all the teachers have “standing desks"
that are fixed
no the ones in the AP Sem room are like
full on
standing desks
on wheels
and they
move
up and down
like the whole thing
oh thats sick
not this
thats kinda eh
also
did I tell you
i generally dislike anyhting on wheels
the school got new computers
then they took the monitors
and placed them upside down
pls tell me they are good ones
and they took the chairs
tf?
cuz ur not allowed to use them
why?
they have like 9 or 10th gen core
and USB-C
whats the point of buying new ones then?
oh heck yes
are they dell optiplex?
yes
ah
I think they have a plan with dell
yea school discount
actually some of the rooms like the AP CS room
dont have monitors anymore
huh
they were doled out to the teachers
ssh/vnc into them
no they are also unplugged
and the ethernet cables are like
awww
omg
in like
the biggest
disorder
oh god
i got one though at some point
and plugged it in
and got 1.2 gbps
to my laptop
remember the computer we installed vnc server on?
yes
i think it may still work
how could i forget
akhil
it would still work
if it were on
are they all just unplugged?
like all the comps?
wait
holdon
cause animations are on
i just tried to reach it
and it told me
no authorize
cause kids remote into them
and i lost access to "A's Team"
thats cause i removed u
ah
i needed to add ramesh to get tech support
huh
aw
you dont have windows
with Quick Assist
ik
Quick Assist is literally the best
yea
that would have been nice
but he didnt vnc into my comp so its still useless
unless they get it on linix somehow
Quick Assist?
something along the lines
something better than vnc
cause vnc is just garbage
the nice things about quick assist are
1.
good connection
2.
draw on person's screen
3.
invoke task manager even if they cant
4.
restart their computer remotely, and then automatically reconnect when the computer restarts
and auto log back in
5.
most important
its preinstalled
idk there are certain windows things
that are just
useful
and not anywhere else
yea
ehh
having been using mac for almost a year or two now
macos has all i ever need or want
like yea quickassist is useful
i mean my list of things on windows
are quickassist
but i never see myself using it
Connect
aka Miracast
and OneNote
yea i have airplay but thats kinda different
this is like
so useful
i never draw so
did i tell you
i take notes in le terminal
how at Drama club
yea
lol terminal frog
terminal is nice
but like the connect thing
its like Sidecar
its convienient to make .md files in it
but it works on all the things
windows
i want to try this so badly
but i dont have an ipad
so i can use my laptop as a second screen
and interact
huh
see this is what i wanted to do
get an ipad pro and a mac mini
you dont understand how useful this was at drama club
like
it like
saved me
huh
like
you do not understand
how much easier it is
not like
to be onstage
with the light board
rather than off stage
with the light board
like
cuz what we had to do before
not like
was have one person on stage
and the other
at the board
and then
we would yell
to each other
or use walkie talkies
but then
ah of course
one person would inevitably be better than the other
with the system
which was usually me
and so like
not like
but so what i could do
was pair my laptop to the light board one
and then
good job
take it to the stage
and get
the screen
and the controls
on stage
from my laptop
it was
amazing
huh
mr Harvey was like
blown away
and then it solved all our problems
i could go and debug
on stage
thats convienent ig
i would never see myself using it
i think apple has something similar to it
lemme check
also universal standards are nice
like USB C
yup
apple uses USB C
which is good
usb c is a godsend
as you can see in that picture
im using mr Harvey's charger
if the macs used a fricken lightning
i would have killed something
i wish i could
the downside is i need like a massive brick
that can supply like 87 watts
Harvey's laptop does 120w
over usb c
cuz dell magik
dell es bueno
the limit is 100
i like their laptops
i dont think his XPS 15 does charging at 5w
idk what mine does
5w charging is a nice feature
my Lenovo has it
well more like 5v charging
huh
cuz it means
in a pinch
if you forget your charger
you can use any USB port
or like in a car
huh
i mean i wish i had usb ports
but
no
like
any usb port you find
that supplies power
if you have a type a to type c cable
huh
wait
then
if ur comp has a usb a that supplied power
and u connect it back to ur computer with usb c
infinite energy?
infinite power
yes
ik
also if ur in a place where there is no high voltage
i have found out the hardway
to never charge a macbook pro with multiple usb c things
cause it charges on any usb port
what happens
so if u plug 2 things that give power in
it just rejects power completely
lol
Lenovo just like
idk what it does
u gotta like do a full reboot for u to make it work
its just cool with it
i think apple released a update that fixed that
and allows u to pick
but i dont wanna update
the thing about it is for 5v charging you need a boost converter
cause big sur
cuz laptop batteries are usually dual cell
usually in 2s2p configuration
or 2p2s
and so they are 7.4v
and that means they charge at like 8.2v
huh
like electrons
no
stop
we are done
with electrons
1s22s22p6
oh we r just getting started
2series2parallel
we havent even done covalent bonding yet
oh and redox reactions
those r fun
did you wanna go into Biomed
idk im bouncing around stuff
but yea its something i would like to do
i see
you could do stuff in my mom's lab
she took a high schooler last year
labs r cool
she does imaging
huh
she wants this
as i have discussed
already
yes
its 800k
i think
wait no
that's the cost of the whole project
its more like 350k
thats expensive
it is
but ppl giv money
*yawn
i should do
more hw
i have been doing hw since like
12:05
- dinner
and this discussion
U should
We got edison bulbs today
i have another math section to do
I am both so fascinated and terrified of them
why
wait
real ones?
or LEDs
Idk
I think they real
are they dark orange
or light yellow
Light yellow
LED
wait
i think
wait
are the filaments thin
or thick
Idk
I havent looked into the bulb itself
do the filaments look yellow when they are off
Kinda
yeah LED
They r more orange
They look so cool tho
Cause they dont have a diffusion layer
Its just clear
wait
i sent an image
this?
Not exactly
Kinda
we got some like that
well
Different shape and stuff
some with clear
for the chandelier
Mine r clear
cuz we have a center hall colonial
They look so cool
yes
cuz you see that chandelier was drawing
so much current
it arced every time it was turned on
like to the point that
Um
the switch
had black dust
coming out of it
Um
Thats not good
and the switch got warm
Um
so we switched to LEDs
which required 1
buying leds
and 2
Bueno
buying a ladder
since the thing is so damn high up
I understand
We have a thing on our staircase
Its so high up there
yes
heres a question
why are white LEDs
hardest to make
and why were they the last kind of LED to be made
Idk
I feel they would be the easiest
no
that is
not
you see
the reason
is that #1
white
is not a color
its all the colors
Ah this
but then theres the chemistry of the LED
different chemistries make different colors
thing is
our eye only sees up to blue
as well as red and green
red came first
it was ez
no prob
now
theres this trick
called fluorescence
where you shine light on something
and a different wavelength comes out
but
Wavelength huh
unfortunately
it only goes down in energy
so
if you have red
you cannot make blue
or green
so only red
but then
they came up with green LEDs
so now you can make yellow
although i think they came up with chemically yellow LEDs too
but blue
blue is not easy
no it is not
it was like
*checking Wikipedia*
Nice one
it was not
until
the 1990s
that the first blue led
was invented
each color
has to be invented
also
forgot to mention
before red LEDs
came IR LEDs
but so this Japanese guy
came up with a Gallium Nitride formula
for blue leds
but it was like
really dim
and expensive
it took
a long time
for it to become brighter and cheaper
but
with blue LEDs
you could now
make white
fun fact
white leds
do not use red green and blue
they use only blue
Cymk?
+ a phosphor coating
Huh
it means
that
wait
*getting image*
this is RGB
but
this is Blue + phosphor
which is much more like incandescent light
Huh
Interesante
now the samsung 2835 is a thing
and so now
white leds
are commoditized
good white LEDs
i have 1200 samsung 2835 white LEDs lighting my bedroom
Ah right
U should set up the rgb
i should
um
no more words
the thing is like
i need another PSU
to run them
i really like my 2835s
they are really bright
and color accurate
but unfortunately
they emit vinyl chloride vapor
so my mom says i have to take them down
so i dont get cancer
*sigh
Of course
idk its probably not that bad
its only when they are on
and they heat up
Its prob a little
Otherwise they wouldnt be allowed to sell them
its china
so like
its the coating
But overtime it could do some damage
the tube they are in
i leave them at 30% perceived most of the time
which is 10%
aka i think about 4.4 watts
my watch is just at like 9%
idk why
its usually at like 65% at this time
i need to do 20 more math problems
and you have switched to Capitals
which means
you are probably going to sleep
Yup
Psychoanalytic Lens
Correcto
cy pays attention
*sigh

lets get started.
lol this question assumes i know anything about baseball
it assumes i know what the "pitcher" is
To move up to AP or not
for Gov/Econ
i prob am
as well as ap econ
wait
r they different classes
or is it gov and econ
one class
it is gov an econ
one class
there is a seperate class
called ap econ
ah
i might do AP Psych
idk i kinda want to get financial literacy credits out of the way
summer
and ap econ convers those
just do financial lit over the summer
i might
idk what to do for electives
are you doing AP Physics
yup
well then its easier to choose electives
since you only have to choose one
yea one elective
i need to check if i got all my elective credits out of the way
i need arts and financial lit
i got arts this year
and we did cad last year so thats 21st
or whatever that category is called
i should have not done IED and CAD
i should have done animation that year
yup
i just did animation
it was ez
*yawn
the USA
it is not worth it
emphasis and theme
how can this be done
in what
the usa is not worth it
nice
or something better than our iPad 4 from 2012
so its either a weapon
or
I think it works on my hardware
I wonder why that is
but with LoRaWAN
The red one would be smaller
i will never need to type that character
its sorta meh
well actually if you paste it in chrome
that is interesting
but uwp is made with .net framework
but yknow it could also not work
yes
tbh i should go
right click on file in onedrive
on which ima connect raspberry pis
I hast indeed
o wait
And the router status leds
where cy spent 3 days a week for 2 years
no thats 3
there are just slightly too many
and maybe take a different approach
and some of the new surface devices are actually slightly repairable for the first time
i just dont use it as primary
what is that
s/
it would
s/
It's a life vest
s/
s/
but she was like
I see
Um
i dont think cet is a word
there were some others i did not work as closely with
so for example
because they are the decendants of slaves

upi
my power supply smells weird
I forgot mine
so i removed it
ima doin LoRaWAN
and its being a pain
/
Should I do lvm
In china
my power supply smells weird
the hell
i taught my brother how to use espeak
That is good
that is anticompetitive
i couldn't get them on fedora or ubuntu either
of my dad's money
that is also dissapearing tonight
Yes I am now aware of that
i see
upi
um cy
lol
so it will never work
wdym
otherwise it is ce
and lights
be vegetarian
but what if i am in west asia
but a whole computer
but
maybe later
huh lights are vegentarians
good to know
So
more like 90 maybe
we must combat overpopulation
China and Japan
all your devices have 5g
i mean
i want the datas
the palmrest
and so you sort of just have a WiFi gateway for all your legacy wifi devices
i see you are tired of what you have
cuz they might have designed with the forethought of lights being installed
not the paper towel
i can recieve money from people
like the ability to replace a screen for $200
the box is supposed to scale itself
Flask?
so nvm
yes
then while its printing
akhil is ahead of you
i think ima go
and you will see
and
what
why is akhil ahead of me
idk
and things that define people
from ramesh
understandable
lol
i wanted to say life
i dont watch tv so
but ill hold off until the next one to do stuff like that
i see
no 
u just request 
5 times 
the api is really fast
sorta not really
take time
ryzen 5 3600
/
big companies are important though
s/
no i cant cuz linux doesnt work with realvnc
did it work
you got somewhere
maybe you will find me in Europe
what on earth is this character you just sent me
I'm not board rn tho
i wanneda send more
other than that it looks good
and apparently 6 months ago

AMD RX 5700 seems similar

um
there are some other things though

I liked the Manjaro theme last time I think
idk if its worth that much time to get this server to work
So it would be interesting to see them make a new version of their architecture for high performance
maybe
and im lazy
also
and the same thing on the phone
But you see I noticed a lot of attention to detail in deepin that I do not see elsewhere
everyone will steal and take free stuff
sadly
but why would we?

Heck yes

what else is new
for the usb ports
you have to find a balance

s/
maybe an IR beam break sensor?
s/
Should I
I suppose
with windows
if it gets worse
I think so
/
idk
you try and make that work
Pattalh
well heres step one
people are rigid
how to try it
"defund the police" is horse crap
that is the kind of thing that i like to know about
wear os
And that is against rules
outside of reddit
Laura
yes
mais quand est-ce tu vas faire marcher ton sensor
no
yes im aware
seems familiar
but its 24 out rn
you must look beneath the surface
that
and I have rebooted the pi
frankly the only reason why i have taken a slight liking to iphones
What about it
to get onto a network?
if this step takes you more than 2 hours to complete
so is win32
My code is generally horse crap
is a low res sillouhette of myself
So whatever you got on wifi 5, you can safely say it will be twice that with WiFi 6
this is dealing with white people
aesthetically and Ui design wise
idk probaly audio data
that you are a female
i have audio data that you are a female
like on my desk
huh
you could literally have counted
a
but it can be hard to build these things
?
but that being said
why is it doing this?
kinda like microsoft
I have many other things to do
but
gl with that
i would recommend buying one of these
why tho
i suppose
msft knows how to do scrolling
LaCy
but im having that feeling
or "send without sound"
Wait
both of which i lack
but honestly for applications that small
or wifi
and i giv u filament
for skool
i fail alg
idk i dont see anything on the leaderboard that would suggest that
Well
Those could be the bottlenecks
akash was like 2k messages
and it will also be secured
the api
they will better themselves
has
cuz like one moment
19k messages
Yes but they're gonna do that anyway
nice
o
sick
*sigh
and high speed rail
their emphasis on the little things
/
and sells to them
But I removed rcs
the americans like their ə
connect power and wifi
ok my fingers hurt
*sigh
Like it hides if the window is maximized
I see
can intervene and stop the government
Maybe a vm
because i want to plug in iphone
and if you forget a comma
i will give you the answer
Also ima make this app independently of your sign in system
if i stay here any longer i will not sleep and i will fail at honors english
i see
um
sorta not really
but yea blur is usually better
1
one meat dish per week
cool then that's fine
that purple dot is my grandparents
pop pop pop
ima hire akhil to try things
pop
well sometimes i think that too
pop
*sigh
in a cup that size
get it
RameshNet
the one you were talking about that uses only outgoing
yea i thot so
wait it didn't work
and i think word also should work though wine
mine computer has's wifi 6 too
and have diffusers that bring them up to the panel right next to each other
Can I show you something
Formatted it via Linux usb
if they do good stuff with the new iPhone and mac
I wish I could send smells
That's a joke
no i cant cuz linux doesnt work with realvnc
you do you
just for screenshare
and we often get along better with those of similar culture
probably assumed amd was the same as arm
it is supposed to look like this (Edge)
well
I think the sign in system is a bit overrated
IR beam break sensor
when did you read this
Please withhold your communications until after class
and that it is too hard
then i say it stuff
cuz its a far-stretching distribution network
but im tired of it
Westbrook
i didnt turn it on
i fixed it
here you wanna see cool video
and how they are against immigration
it does
they do things small companies can't
You must test chrome
im watching this thing
i need to clear the battery backed memory
I will see if it saved
i now have a bank account
see the thing is
but
design this in freecad
i see
and uses them for r g and b
and tbh
it elaborates
their equivalent
I should be done with my books and with my summer assignments
ha that was rather short lived

ooh its tomorrow
k
Just cycle the h
is it even still responding
Good bottom surface quality
and science fair people like that
there was a part available on ebay
Idk
but have more line of sight
Pip
and now its cheese
Is it backlogged?
their domain has MX records
Pop
if you feel like wasting time
it is backlogged
binary warms you
Stuff like that
No thanks to you Akhil
idk what it is
it is witing
it all makes sense
for all the messages
to be fulfilled
you are genuinely close
and then the little children died
but you see
a white boy on the history of empathy and racism
my gpu has not been active in longtemps
and if i start a company
you know what i should do
like LoRaWAN
um
why u need a gpu in ur phone
that spins around
multithreaded api queries
but I have faith in society
i had them doing fun stuff with the door
Wth
and ther no internet
what do you think of my ui
what does dm mean
I already looked for this part
Like a sieve
around a true story
but you can examine this
what about it
on a website that is presenting you
i use onenote
we are getting somewhere finally
*cough until your camera doesn't work
Yes
Remember
Speed
but its like mac software
Its still going wth
so it will never work
but then it doesnt actually transfer into the message
ima have an iPhone SE
nothing
they will steal from anyone
was about the force of a tactical nuclear weapon
the only nice thing about xamarin forms
i always try to form opinions
see its complicated
how is this relevant
as long as they do what the government says
censorship is bad
and no one else
and then
Okay
Wh
a modern one
but that is too expensive
about her
It is lithium ion battery
how should i know
but you can't tell much else
btw
remember theyre just, zeros
But what about the 3rd state
other than to export chat history
Pattalh
And a few crumbs of ice just fell off
?
wait
is it done
and read my book
no
i see
cuz windows is slow
but then again its hard to beat a free sim
hi ramesh
mine computer has's wifi 6 too
the problem is that no, this doesn't work
and i wouldnt buy an ipad for those apps
regarder means to look at
which is
bangslate
2007
um hold on
Okay
oh here are 3 .deb.zx
wait it doesnt follow the terms
Yeah
but for this assignment we were assigned the topic
On top of hay
I have many other things to do
is very similar to what people do in work
that is really easy
and if my face looks good
no rn its doing weird flask stuff
wanna hint
im back to where i was
ima go do math as not to fail school
but then this deal thing
and it was cool
its primarily using my cpu
well sometimes i think that too
wait since this is a webhook
i think ima finish desiyning my waterproof box
I see
i can actually like
so ima leave and let you write
u could take it apart
use
since i will have remaining light strip
i have not yet reached the point where i just like reading
gunicorn
no
and even though it only has 512MB of ram
iPhone much more efficient
and python threading
or 6 gpus like linus
i see
he prob uses imessage tho
i figured out how to modify the firmware on my 3d printers UI controller
then i bundle a bunch of other things in
and it is maddening
so when a request comes in
then pcie to usb and SD interfaces
i just say "ok"
wait i found image
then send it to a queue
it sits for a moment
handled by workers
but dont you think that's a weapon?
but i dont think my werkzeug is fast enough on the api side
cyfinfaza: other than to export chat history
wait
yes
cyfinfaza: yes
done
Nice
wait Ramesh what is your locker number
his was right next to me
Huh
we talked
and walked home
together
it was fun
before COVID
Huh
python threading is great
you can specify as many workers as you want
and they just rip through tasks
the problem is like
it works for repetitive tasks
but for tasks that need to talk to each other
i want to make my web crawler
so it uses a db
Huh
Im trying to get mysql to set a user password automatically
But it doesnt really work
relational databasing
nice
that's one of my browser windows
i have like 6
Huh
I dont even have that many
Huh == I see
python
wait
did the power go out
in the hills
i would write python
dr p just lost 8 students
yes
what is it with the hills
and power
and internet
no its not the entire hills
so essentially
only one hill
the hills has two power grids i think
ah
my power grid is closest to the highway
so my power never goes out
ever
i see
the kids further into the hills do lose their power
I see
how do i make a infinite for loop in python again?
isnt there a more fun way
um
like for i:
idk
ah see fun ways
?
font

U have had more problems with ur mouse than i ever had with mine

so
huh
interesting
can you send me that hostname
that it found
the idiot
castor
literally dug himself into a hole
they are USING castor's evidence
against the defence
like not yet
but theyve set it up like that
im too used to thinking mitch is majority leader
whats happening?
castor
said
biden
won.
these guys
are showing what trump's lying was doing
so they can literally take castor's points
and say
"look this was a lie"
I really hope they do that
that would be hilarious
please do
use the opposing side's words
against them
is the trial today?
this week i think
huh
huh
it seems
i need a nextcloud now
i shall set one up in the next couple of days
mabye during the long weekend
…
let's see how the borg backups are going

bueno?
yes
if you open my nextcloud in chrome you get fancy blur
dont see it
oh maybe the update broke it
meh
how did you add it

hoverfancy nextcloud plugin
i would not mind
idk if you can actually do that
there are some limitations
im p sure u can

but that not cheep
Should I
it would probably be cheaper to just get an ereader

Oral history

such that it can be run through stt
on a computer
yes
hmm
i just wrote a program
no imma do this
you know how there are live translating humans
they translate what they hear

and have the stt listen to me
translate from english to french and try it

mayukha called me
work for cloudflare
and we talked
and then
wow
she said
wait
shoot
i have to do this thing
call be back at 3:30
so i called her back at 3:30
then we talked
then she said
wait shoot
i have practice
call me back at 7
haha
have fun with people
i could see it
i personally find them to be annoying
she was like
she muted
then she looked into the distance
and then
she was like
yes
like this
and then shes like
cy
i gtg
bye
Haha
what if you just used text instead
ramesh
we would get nothing done
we have to
record
a presentation
K fine
what are you going to do
call her at 7
yes
and then is she going to be like
"shoot"
"i gtg"
no probably not
anway at that point we will just be recording
the video
we pretty much finished the prep
so what imma do
is finish formatting the works cited
then
do my oral history transcript
then maybe work on CodeTools
lol no
jk
that would never happen
CodeTools
is good
i have a calc test unfortunately
fortunately it's the only homework I have
i wanna listen to a song
then do it
a magical button
for dealing with works cited
…
I
I use google docs
no
word
i use word
for important things
look at this wonderful slideshow
Mayukha
mayukha is my group
its interesting they dont let us put our names anywhere
i cant even say like, mayukha will elaborate on this
at least i dont think i can
although then we would also have to remove the names from the questions at the end
so mayukha is literally the only person in your group
and we would have to remove the names from the zoom
since she "is" your group
yes
there was SG Prejean
but she was not present
too many times
so we talked to Mr Y
he said work as a group of two for now
then SG came back
so we said ok well include her
we could use some ethics research
and then
next day
she comes and says
oh btw
im dropping this class
hHah
and so shes like
idk exactly all the details
but I might not be able to participate
and so we're like
we will do this without you
well actually
shes like
can you do this without me
and its like
yes
because
you have not been here
like
at all
and so she says
ok cool
and leaves
…
that is an interesting story
sg has an IEP i think
what is an IEP
essentially she has some like
disability or something
idk
shes in drama club
I sea
so it is just you and mayukha
last year she was an actor
this year she was in crew
the main actor
and the year before that
her brother
was the main actor
Intéressant
believe me
My first test is Monday I think
have you worked with mayukha before
yes
on like
every
single
other
project
in AP Sem
who is the other person
like
every other
so what is the other group
what
?
you said
every other project
so
what about the projects you don't work with her with
no they were all
with her
there was also Rachel
but then for some reason
she was like
removed
idk
interesting
we were the B hybrid
okay

Mr Y was like
they want us to do a scavenger hunt

but I think we're ok
ah right
advisory was bad
no he was like
i think we're ok
we don't need to do that
then he was like
now look for things in your house
i definitely want to see things in your house
moving on
for people in the room
its only cy
doesn't matter
moving on
now smile and be happy
have a great day everyone
good bye
literally
no joke
and so now
ah speed
so i did not have to do advisory
in fact i didn't even see what we were supposed to do
lucky
i had to on monday
it was bad
also like
my laptop
is having
GPU failure
it got much worse tho like
haha
it would black out every time i let go of it
thats bad
idk why
it was doing this earlier with Google Slides
like a month ago
google slides just started like
disappearing
kind of like that
but it would turn white instead of black
also on this laptop
so like
I'm not sure
i am running the windows dev channel
Unigram light mode is nice
um
thats for sure wrong
grain is like something u should eat less of i think
also cs today
yes
*yawn
walking home

in cs
k coming
i am definately going to your ip address, Lucy
Yes
Go to it
i clicked one once
it said
Or ddos it
Warning.
You are about to see naked people
and i was like
Thats not good
id rather not
its not much
but
it paves the way
for what's to come
*sigh
the problem with 0 bytes is like
if i change one character in my code
i cannot save it anymore
since that would be one byte more than i have
so i cant even code anymore
i even have NTFS filesystem level compression enabled on my downloads folder
which saves some space
14gb
i could enable it on the whole disk
lol that's why theres no space
theres an update
time to go to 4h fair planning meeting
maybe i will get to make them a
i like making
Huh
U bottom out of storage really quickly
I make it a habit to have 80+ gb left
lol they are making us rename ourselves to our favorite fair food
100+ if it drops below 70
mine is bubble tea
Nice
they are figuring out how to rename themselves
How
tbh i wonder that too
Im still so astounded
its like
my pc works just fine
like
everything works
zoom works
Wait
but
if i try and save literally
one byte
So if one cookie gets loaded
of code
it says no
error
no save
no space
no the cookie wont get loaded
or itll get loaded temporarily into RAM
or
it will delete some cache
and put it there
huh
that
tbh idrk how it works
is very old icons
lol
this is what happens when u use unnotarized mac apps
i need to listen to meeting
bye
adios
see im in a zoom meeting
they really dont use that much bandwidth
amazon bad
i mean like
even Microsoft has a larger renewable energy portfolio than that
and they are like really small
compared to amazon
this is part of the reason i support google cloud over amazon aws
uh wat
ok it wenaway when i reloaded it i was werried
this is a thing in canada
when I went for a college tour there they had to read a similar statement
lol
you
are you actually working on it
jrunnerfive is not work
im working on the other stuff

obligatory
lol
*cough
dont be me
in 10th grade
and believe this is actually true
i need to do
things
bye
Bye
i mean i kinda solved it
I solved all three levels
by looking at the source code
ncie
introducing http, the latest programming language
CodeTools
My dad's excimer laser blew up
and now theres fluorine gas all over his lab
he only has one excimer laser left
what is an excimer laser
Oh no
Not the most electronegative element
some extremely powerful UV laser
that costs like 50k
Thats cheap
Tesla vs laser
lol
except now they cant do the experiment their client needs
he got an email that said
The laser failed (in a big way)
i am making improvements to CodeTools
^^this works now
its not much
API
but it represents
I am working on
MultiHangman
it represents that
the backend
has changed
Cy sees
now i will implement things
you know what my favorite thing about JavaScript is
the print() function
literally
I am going to use elm
prints the document
on paper
no more javascript
go in any browser
any page
f12
console
I really hope mcconnell asks a question
kay codetools works now with the new system
which makes absolutely
no difference
to the user experience yet
frontend
vs backend
understandable
the senator from texas sends a question to the desk.
imma eat dinner
then maybe work on this some more
the flipgrid says its due today
the problem is in order to do that for my "selfie" i have to put my mouse on the ground to click the capture button with my foot
since my hands are full
Ah
hi i need to regex
and im lost
high level: only allow certain html tags
low level: < followed by not < or > and followed by not [list of allowed tags] followed by >
ramesh casually testing the new emotescli and deletes his namespace
lol
cy trying to understand the difference between var and let
constant vs not constant
no like immutable
vs mutable
in rust it's let or let mut
um
what is mutability
i still dont get it
whether you can change it or not
but
then
what is const
like
a default value
a setting maybe
something that DOES not change
like an immutable
might be different
for different runtimes
like user input could be immutable
a const wouldnt be
hm
hmm
why hm with one m
cuz im lazy
are you sure
you haven't seen others do it
so var is function scoped
and let is block scoped
and const is immutable
idk
maybe
i hate js
bye
bye
hey ramesh
What
Is it
would you like to see
some changes
that i made
In a few minutes
ok
ok
hi
hi
um
hold on
wait
what username are you
lemme make one
i need your userid
so i need your username
uh
Username
k one moment
try that
where is the thli from
nowhere
its from
nowhere
ah
jrunner5 is
not
no not rn
but
the html editor
and title
are there
yeah
what is it for
using the new system
that took me like
2 hours
to think of
then another hour
to actually make
help
i keep reloading it
and it blackscreens
im chinease
i see youre data
i giv
to ccp
chinease
ok maybe not that one
because
that those words could be problematic
fbi watch list

MongoDB

im gonna set up a local mongodb at some point
and use it to index the internet
i do not see
i thought
you thought
not well of rust
since it is
confuse
meh
i might use it
when i need to
for compiled stuff
good luck
it like
is hard
ramesh
i can do
whatever i need to
i know
when i need to
it's just that
it took me a while to learn
since I was idk
being slow
and learned it very slowly
i like web

Pretty sure thats white noise/ANC noise

Yea its the whining
idk how to feel about it
it's a whatever

je suis en train de faire quelque chose
Yea its just i see alot more sketch mega stuff then others
Cant
I really want to make this programming language
what do you think
i sent three snippets
Its good
Idk I have thought about making programming languages
imma write mine in rust
it'll be interpreted
You have to really know what you are doing
yeah
tokens
Idk you should try
I might work on CodeTools today
good
Nice
And get multiple tests set up
I think im watching a movie about a mom killing her daughter
Huh
imma
listen to addison
*addison mitchell mcconnell

Meh
How were they supposed to get 17
they weren't
but I want to see what mitch mcconnell is saying
Addison

Holy
To be fair

how tf is solid barium
supposed to
combust
with heat
and oxygen
^^2 types of combustion
also im pretty sure that was for other thing
i had solid barium for the deconstruction whatever its called
what is the chemical formula of solid barium
Ba?
it cant be
yes
its solid barium
but like
that means its barium
so Ba
so its not reactive enough
to like
be unstable
hm
ok
Then write a combustion equation
wait
im lost
lemme find myself
brb
*cough
alrighty have fun
k I found myself
we're all good
its some sort of intermediary web framework
Looks cool
for making mobile apps
Angular/React/Vue
and it relies on apache cordova
so im like
lemme just learn apache cordova
then I can port directly from an existing web app
i oughta learn some of these js frontend frameworks tho
like react
i know about ionic because the 4h app person used it
to make the 4h app
i was not 100% satisfied by the result
see since its a web framework
you can like
run your app in a browser
and all the demos
and documentation
run live in the browser
me: elm
im like randomly testing internet explorer
and then like
spacex is launching a rocketship in 3 minutes
so im like

im chatting with people on discord
nixos broke
lol
Huh

since the only other Chromecast device I have is bravia
and it is explicitly listed
no wait what hold on
who installed nginx on my tv
hmm
this is intriguing
apparently you can http post to the tv
and it will do things
like remote control
you send it some XML
wait
rce
remote code execution
this is like
somehawt cool
lol so can I go to like ppls houses
and like

wait
hold on
wait
it used to
add
a
what
is this
hold on
reload
k
it works now
yes
now
i need to make it sync
with the db
so imma do that
bye
bye
How tf do I use this
Its like a cnc clamp
Whoever designed this is honest to God the worst engineer on earth
cy is wrestling with javascript
its almost working
but then like
not working
cy does not like js arrays
they dont =
python:
JavaScript:
can you tell that one makes sense
and the other doesn't?
i repaired my code
smh
javascript
dammit javascript
tf is this
it exists
dont tell me
it doesn't
exist
hi my name is javascript
and your array
an array.
lol its my fault as usual
btw ramesh
the args actually like
save now
that said i gtg and im taking down the server for now
bye
hi everyone
who is doing the 4 days in person
i may be switching to virtual
but i was wondering what you were doing
Ive been virtual
I dont think u can change rn tho
Mp 3 started
no by tomorrow
you have to decide
virtual or 4 days in person
Ive already submitted virtual
k
ramesh you will be happy to hear
Oooh
See
Now that it's 4 days
I probably will never go to school
if it were two I would have probably went mp4
lol
this is annoying
I really wanted to go to school
i almost have fun stuff working with codetools
also
codetools isn't working
as in
monaco won't load
at all
.
yes its in active development
the code is
corrupted
rn
use git
i use git
so i can go delete everything
and not have issues
please wait as i locate where my promise ends
my internet is having issues
either that
or no
the internet is having real issues
smh javascript
brackets
use elm
i dont like
brackets
they get really messy
and then eventually
you end up with one missing or one too many
and it all goes down from there
this is regrettable
lol
so many errors i forgot what i was even making
please wait while i remember
k it does nice stuff
go to the editor
am
the
new test doesnt work
what
pitcher
please
um
it works for me
how do you reproduce this issue
log in as Username
Password
then try going to the editor in any browser
including chrome
k dont edit anything
or it will probably break
since it does not support multiple clients on one file
I didn't
wait ik why its not working
monaco is broken
its because
your content is outdated
i must erase your content
wait
hold on
i cant do that yet
wait
please wait while cy edits his code
and makes it actually generate the right stuff
k reload and try again
it runs
but does nothing
pitcher
please
oh
it works
ok
Make it like
more obvious
make what
more obvious
i mean
i can put an arrow
like this?
yes
that is being added rn
reload repetitively for live updates
this file
is what ramesh is interested in
S files
someone tell me who keeps turning my lights off
at like 9:37 every tuesday
like they just turn off
and i have to turn them back on
akhil
he actually guessed your werkzeug debug pin
and added a script to turn off your lights
f
gee thanks vscode
for putting a fcking space
before every
single
ah
quotation mark
cy swears now
he does
when hes mad
your code just like
errors out
and you wonder why
and then it turns out
and you use that like 20 times
and every other string
now ends with a space
a;sdflka;sdlkfja;sldkfj
and I
I use emacs
i thought i had fixed it
but now it wont save args
it is being nice now
yes
you have not implemented the structure i requested
what did you want
again
so it cannot detect which ones have runtime errors
lemme look
just send me the protobuf
for what you want
and ill do it eventually
um
you mean a .proto file
yes
lemme see if i can make one
why are you using required btw
its bad practice
and not a thing in protobuf 3
im using
protobuf 2
dont make it protobuf 3
it doesnt work with kotlin
yes but they explicitly state
do not use
required
even tho its a thing
okay
get rid of it then
no you can do that
imma just make a protobuf for what i want
this is what i sent you last time:
is that
protobuf
no its not
give me protobuf
i will try to do that
hi ramesh
this
is what you want
yes
then you will have it
ok
not today
ok
not tomorrow
but like
on friday
ok
does it load
yes
yay
free file storage
no limits
i see
it's just the upload speed is slow
lol so its literally telegram
unlimited storage
with slow upload speed
no
this
you can upload
like
20 gb files
I see
loads forever
yes
but like
it
what
hi im going to send you elementary os
through telegram
bad
how
drag and drop
that takes forever right
um
yes
well
not that long
that took about 5-10 mins
can you install ipfs
no more like 5
no
the desktop
what
ipfs desktop
i mean
apt install ipfs probably works
how does ipfs work
did you install it
im working on it
ramesh its not loading
its taking
forever
what is not loading
ipfs
how so
idk
use the cli version then
still?
just
install the cli tool
on windows
um
ok
did you
installing...
what
*cygh
wait
k so
apparently i dont understand how this works
i gtg bye
huh
Um
hi im JavaScript i do type conversions for you automatically
That should not be happening
no it should
it does type conversion
Oh then thats fine
== allows type conversion
I thought it was comparing integer with a string
=== "strict ==" means no type conversion
Huh
i just still cant get over the fact that like
Interesante
python^^
^^js
Thats weird
arrays will never be equal
ever.
in js
since they are objects
Really?
which is a pain in the tukkus
its like you can do all your fancy technical jargon magik rules
but
i dont wanna deal with em
the difference with python
is it abstracts them
so you dont have to deal with them
ramesh why hasn't someone put bill wurtz on her playlist
akash and Michael imma show her the latest update
if u wanna stay
or not
i uploaded CodeTools to GitHub
its private tho
should i make it public?
no im not making it public
it has keys and passwords in it
i need to make them environment variables or whatever
Just
Read it....
are you staying hybrid/in school
Im in hybrid

Ah okay that kinda makes sense
He wants us to annotate it
wait what does PT2 mean?
Part 2?
I have just never had a teacher mail me forms
Performance Task 2
Huh
what r those?
Essentially they are like 20%-30% of your AP score
Per PT
So instead of the test being everything
ah they r for the AP stuff
Yes
pog i finished my tesselation project
Lol I haven't started
A pin
is essentially a password
It's local to the device
And linked to windows hello
yea but its a password essentially
Unlike a password
idk why u would call it a pin tho
Other than that yes
Make it 127 characters long
yes
um

Do I ever not have to meet with Mayukha
im setting up windowz
no
I fixed my hackintosh and now its working perfectly
mostly
its super nice ngl
oh no
thats not good
this is why u need to give windows actual cores
this is on ur server?
yuppers
I see
on nix os?
no probably not
no
See it has the big ol Microsoft name on it
its on Hyper-V server
i see
Its super annoying tho
Windows
It wont install the stupid graphics card drivers
i clapped my hands
that is a chemical change
?
Um
Pretty sure there is more
they thinking like explosion sound from popping
meh
its all of the above
hi my name is cy and i dont get it
Is it a skeletal equation?
um
bc thats what got me before
Write chemical equations for each of the following double-replacement reactions that occur in water. (Use the lowest possible coefficients. Use the lowest possible coefficients. Include states-of-matter at 1 atm and 25°C in your answer.)
AMD has identified core 06 as the fastest in my system.
*clap
*clap
*clap
hi my name is
i make
Yes
Good job
Ah
wow bing
this is a really good source
not only is it a commercial
but it also doesn't know how to spell
whats misspelled?
im blind
WebTRC
Ah i see it
its WebRTC
last one
they spelled it correctly before
they did
perhaps i will integrate webrtc into Triangle chat
once i get to actually making Triangle Chat
mabye
can u do something for me
go into ur windows\system32
and see if there is a oledlg.dll library/file thing
like cat it or smthing
sketchy
i dont need the output
i just need to know if it exists
cause my server keeps throwing an error that it doesnt exist
and idk how to get it
ugh
so it does exist
i need to either download it off a sketchy website
or download windows actual gui stuff
I can send it to you over IPFS
and copy it off that way
nah dont
idk whats gonna be in the file
i mean it should work fine
ill just boot up a vm and copy it over that way
ig
whats this
in the powershell terminal?
you need to install ipfs
lol
how tf do i do that on powershell
im being like ramesh
if i send it on telegram would that work
or should i send a link
a link would be better
i can curl the link and get it
here download it from ipfs's official gateway:
yes
or do that
ill try both
ugh
windowz bad
0xc000007b
why is it this hard to install stupid drivers
i would never use windows on a server
unless i absolutely had to
in fact i would never use windows anywhere
yea its annoying
other than a PC
i think i found a fix to whatever i was dying over
i have to call mayukha.
im trying it cause it has fun GPU-P
ah of course
bye
adios
the speed of IE
its been 20 minutes
only about 200 mb i think installed
do you want a CSC meeting today
doesnt really matter to me
they want to cancel it
someone tell me if this works
I'm too scared
stupid windows
i am now accessible over ipfs
dont u love windows
oh thats sick
if you have brave you can type that in
i have the plugin for ipfs
i want a domain tho
hold on
i only use ipfs for files atm
for later
why does windowz have to be so annoying with drivers
i just want green checkmarks
Also
Yuh at 215
coolio
Yuhhhh i can't wait to see the deployment of da drone
xml merging works.
i like this
is gonna look cool
I like the jetpack
that doesnt do anything
it's not recursive yet
you need to install brave
or
the firefox/chrome extension for ipfs
ah
i see
it will only load for ipfs users
since the gateway is slow
wait so is there comp sci or not
Perseverance is landing rn
Lol
Go to jpl
Bruh
watch on NASA’s channel
or here
Nah jpl is better
i mean they r the same
JPL is like 15 microseconds ahead
It also has views of the control room and u get to see the ppl jump for joy
true
dude their naming is so cool
all their rovers and instruments have cool names
Yuh
wait
the jpl stream
is 360
when does the thing actually land
and do we get to see it
yes
technically
if we see it
it has landed
how do we see it
cameras
livestreaming from mars?
dominic's profile picture is not 4h-computers-appropriate
kinda
its transmitting camera data
but like i said if we see it starting landing
it has landed essentially
yes
but
which livestream is the one that shows everything
all of them
they r the same livestream
one is 360
r all the same
which one?
idk they all will probably do all the stuff
i wanna see the jetpack
its cool
im installing eyes
so i can see it in real time
have fun
i mean
u can hold off for a while
landing is in like an hour i think
foo
baz
bar
spam
etc
what is your favourite
mine is quux
?
…
nvm
im watching this
yet another sgi video
ah
a fellow wack user
ew
There all wack users
Wacks rise up
There desktops are probably running Linux
no i think they run windows
nah id imagine they made their own OS
like NasaOS
No cuz they have wacks next to them
Yuh like something secure so u can tap into the DSN
yea
u cant really tell what they r from the quality
Yuh I think that is on purpose bc like u don't want china seein the com system
And the dsn network
imagine they have passwords like visible
Lol
half an hour
Da chat b like
idk why
bad
it does nothing
why didnt they bring Bill Nye
i hate how stdout is a bottleneck
I did it
this merges properly
apparently google autofill now does names
of staff
Does
Shazam
Work
On the song in this video
lemme see
cool
lmk
shazam says no
but
google found something close
avril
yes
wait
i watch that channel a lot
literally watched every single one of his videos
lol i think you already told me
yes
ive been a fan
since fifth grade
not kidding
ew
oh god
box
lol transparent pngs
dont work
treeee
yours is better than mine
wait
what.
is there a way for me to get one system out of two computers
distributed
i think so
?
armbian?
no
like
in plan 9
that is way more than what i paid for the chip
you can just mount the other computer's cpu
thats cool
so
i mean
u might as well just be making a cluster
use plan 9.
idk
but that seems
ramesh is in that picture
familiar
locate ramesh
no

no
tbh idk what that even is
ipfs
so tor is basically what ipfs is
but the http version
im just going through a directory i have called "PortfolioSite5"
uh
no
that is not
what is tor
no
tor is
similar
but
not
that
at a
ll
what is it
tor is like a vpn
a distributed vpn
ah
I see
that seems very cool
like
in school
you can use tor
to access
blocked websites
hum
do you
yes
does it work
wait
also sometimes its faster downloads
okay well then I will use it
like if for some reason its really slow in the US
so with tor you can access regular websites
most of the tor relays are in europe
not just
the onion ones
yes
if it just
like
is faster
why doesn't everyone use it
no its way slower
but
in certain edge cases
a mirror in europe
will be faster over tor
by like
10%
simply because the tor relay
i see
has a faster transatlantic connection
I may investigate this
also
tor is full of FUD
what is FUD
they try to FUD you against tor
lol
tor is nice
their main thing tho
is that
they are 100% anonymous
like
if you use tor
literally no one
can identify you
well
there are other benefits too
well no they can identify you
but
they cant see where your requests are going
mm
is this why you have brave
so that's why people use it for dark web
so no one knows they are going to sell drugs
?
brave
has tor built in
um
i didn't know that
it does
you can go try it
go to the facebook onion site
doesnt brave also have like discord builtin?
idk
but personally
i might try vivaldi
wait i like brave now
it has both IPFS and Tor built in
i should go ask my dad about tor
so he can yell at me
lol
the main problem with tor is like
a lot of sites block it
ah
which is annoying
what if you try to access like
no they have to explicitly block it
how
does one do this
idk
im curious
its not that easy
but you can identify certain characteristics
like certain ips
idk
is this
see i dont normally get this
microsoft edge
no its brave
with tor
oh
it literally
looks like edge
cuz you can use tor for bot spam
cuz ur ip changes
every time
yes
you reload
ddos
interesting
slllllllowww
what about speedtest
misclick
lol gaming over tor
Ha
do you play games cy
hCaptcha
tor triggered cloudflare
ugh
oo cloudflare has that?
its ddos protection
byewtifil fonts
no stop it
im at a disadvantage
Oh god
thats
not good
im gaming over tor
WTF IS UR PING
WHAT IS THIS GARBAGE
over
tor
shall i build the image now
i think i will
yes
i am getting gpu-p to work

how to use markdown
# Hi
i prefer asciidoc
* Hola

how
to
use
markdown
haha
bruh
im learning latex
asciidoc > markdown > latex
latex is awful
verbose trash
also it's really hard to change the font
its not awfu
fine
i might try to learn it
i mean u should
cause a lot of people use it
song
im listening to song
im not sure what i think of it
Es a bueno song
ah
yes
im now listening to akil sawng
ur not doing ad hoc tho right?
what is ad hoc
like terminal
where u make every flags
it is like
the minimal nix image
required to boot
and from there on out
it pushes to the nix image
using morph
huh
musix
musix
i dont use spotify
i like their images

They prob dont wanna know anything
But had to put something
So they put gender
this oauth2 reminds me

Same
Can u use OAuth2 to sign into other services?
yes
Like aws as an example
If u can
Imma try making one work
imma try
but mine uses nix to automate stuff
there we go
Hmm
smloadr
As long as i can like link OAuth to like gsuite or something and use that for all my accounts
whats the deal with oauth
Its an authentication thingy
yes i know
but like
apparently this is a thing
Yes
Google
Does something very similar to this idea
but i dont get it
do you host it?
Yes
for your services
i see
Take google
U sign into auth
It adds token
yes
Then all the services redirect to that for login
or i could do telegram style
no passwords
no
insecure
why
because it is
like
what if someone gets the phone
true
you should enforce 2fa
no
i will not
2fa is good
enforce
2fa
i dont like 2fa
its really annoying
not unless its really nice 2fa
TOTP is awful
but this isnt what i want
lol
?
Isnt that nixos
i want an image
not a vm
Ah
here
this does it automatically
deezloader
smloadr
and it doesn't do hd
it only does "MP3-128Kbps"
Really
It should do .flac
it should
but
it never has done that
hi res covers tho
r nice
yes
like that's with telegram compression
\uhm
wdym
smloader does do
wait
smloadr
does
lyrics
please stop taking 2 hours to boot the kernel
u prob messed up something
no way the kernel takes 2 hours to boot'
no
it's booting in quiet mode it seems
quiet mode?
album art has never looked this crisp
prob cause it doesnt need to but
i wanna set up sonarr
i like myself some crisp album art
unfortunately
so itll just download all my music
i just bit my lip
so hard
owwwwwww
my lip
this has happened way too many times
it hurts
this is the 3rd time today
the thing is it happens once
and then
it makes it easier
is this good?
for it to happen again
yes
i
…
idk how u manage to do it 3 times in a day
i havent bit my lip or hurt myself in like 4 years
i chew gum
too much
yea everyone does
also my mouth is like
wrong
since i had braces
thats contradictory isnt it?
yes it is
idk i need braces
but i havent got them yet
the thing is
akhil
they moved these two teeth
such that
they are now
vhat
your girlfriend wont want to see your crooked teeth
not in a good position
smh
did it work?
my teeth aint crooked
yes and no
its like a bone needs to get fixed or smth
im gonna have to modify the openstack
i mean at least it works
non of my things ever work
u name it
servers
vms
i like downloading album art
doesnt it take up space?
and u have like 1 gb
this song is good
...
will auto redirect
wait i want it to work through ipfs
wait
what if there was
an ipfs bot
for telegram
you put in your ipfs CID
and it spits out the file
Do it
no not even that like
you just paste
a CID
and it just works
like with YouTube links
no
its not working
and then another one
in nees tot od o scewince
your text and lines do not match
i oughta go study and read now
no
i would get pixel
I did
so im like
On the second floor
wait
and annoying
what if
if you have a wife and a child
if you could only
spend the rest of your life with one
which would you choose
um
a wife
why
i think there is an answer
which is I can have more children
cuz it would be depressing to not ever see the child grow up
uhm
the child grows
then they are not a child anymore
Uhm
they are your child
you contributed to their birth genetically
idk
See hold on a second
This is only for you
So technically the wife can be with the child right?
um
no
no loopholes btw
Aww
DankPods liked the Galaxy Buds Pro
which is um
interesting
Spend the rest of my life right
yeah
Sepukku for the win
would you pull an antigone?
you get reborn
revived
can't do that
you can only die of natural causes
or like
Hey hey hey
old age stuff
Poison is a natural cause
no
Wait so u say revived right
stop trying to mess with the constraints
If i commit sepukku
u dont die
or how about if you commit sepukku
your family goes with you
Damn this turned dark quickly
so akhil
choose
wife or son/daughter
So this
A lifetime
yes
Is defined by the period of usefulness
So
If i become obsolete at one point
I have ended a lifetime
So
If i end my lifetime but am not physically dead
I can create a new lifetime
Avoiding this entire dilemma
Or
I can do whats called a pro gamer move
how
And pull an interstellar

And somehow go back in time
Nope
Oh no

for now
no
bad
that takes forever
* cough it doesnt work i mean
its hanging idk why
probably the public gateway
yes
use the
hold on
meh i can work on this later
i can just run an ipfs node on the system
and then use its api
i was gonna work on codetools
lol
no that is no longer an option
i have to do english
and french
im done with my hw
now I have to figure how to do libvirt xml
this one is good
why do you like geometry dash music
idk
but this one isn't bad

you will not
screw up
my margins
no
stop it
just like
this has been an issue
for like 2 years
lol margin
it's kde
it looks better on gnome
i hate bad margins
kde is
notoriously bad at margins
do your margins right please
no

Lol waidaminet my whole internet is down
telegram has died
you are not seeing this message
my internet is back up
i am seeing this message
its weird
idk why
it just like
does this sometimes
I think its a DNS issue
cuz the earth doesn't turn red
and the browser does not report "you are offline"
but then again cloudflare reports a timeout
my brother came to me once he said
"Cy, the world just turned red"
haha
that rhymes

jrunner5 uses the ipfs port
that is why
stuff no work
jrunner is switching to port 5791
then
they leave the meeting
wait
this is for akhil
what class is akhil in
Aphug
Was akhil in
Im no longer in it
enjoy ur guidance counselor
mine got triggered at me in 9th grad
im done already
nice
we are getting somewhere
should i work on codetools
im kinda mad i didn't learn react or angular or something
and now im suffering from the consequences
haha
id only use elm
js is like
idk i want to reuse components
and now i have to resort to
copy paste
i mean i could use Jinja
but like
idk
ideally i want to "build"
my webpages
like make the components
and then have it compile them all together
imo
i like vue
idk that's a next-time thing
get a mac
it makes this easier
in what way
nix tools
clean ui
great ecosystem and really good support for webdevs
homebrew integration
imma copy and paste my code
problem solved
.
i first have to clear the webhook on my telegram bot
make downstairs a thing
no
downstairs is my actual servers
upstairs is my pc
which is running FaH
and making my bedroom feel like venus
so i think im gonna stop it
or open the window
i thought FaH decreased in popularity
i used to run it in a esxi vm
idk
have you ever used esxi
no
this feels like 1950s movie soundtrack tbh
lol guess what
i like 50s music
and movie soundtrack
not all the songs
some of them are most certainly not 50s soundtrack
actually i think it was just that one
i will stop talking about this album
and work on codetools
ramesh is still
doing things
i am dying rn
why
windowz
lol
and hw
windows "just works" for me
no its not that
i need a 900$ license
tf
yes
windows server
is horrendous
why the f
also the drivers dont work
are you using
windows server 2019 datacenter/standard
windows server
cause
"learning purposes"
its a server
probably
i mean
i can get 3 years on evaluation
then get a job
and pay for it
use
so i probably will do that, then reinstall in 3 years
3 years
or pirate it
Linux
doesn't have gpu-p
ill do this
what is gpu-p
well hold on
but like
i can do gpu p
rn
he doesn't have to
like it work
but you dont need windows server for it
gpu-p basically lets you have
one gpu multiple vms with the same gpu
without spending 90000 dollars on a sr-iov gpu
yes
i need windows server
to run AD and KWS
cy: what is sr-iov
and mabye DNS
And WDS/iPXE
tbf
u can get like a nvidia tesla card
for 60$ on ebay
like a k10 i think
but those are bad
but like
so is the 710
apparently you can gpu-p linux as well
but linux to linux
using lxc
not real vms
eh
its not the worst ngl
it gets the job done
idk ill prob install rancher os rn
this'
is docker madness
yeah
that's how ovirt works
welp lets see if this works
this one is
good
as I said before
idk why
i like it
byewdiful div
loooooooooooooooooooooooooong
is this even english?
ah
im stupid
my protobuf wasn't working
now it does
nice
should I upgrade to 10gb ethernet?
Yes
or get 100 fiber
im not that rich
it would go well with your ryzen 9 5950x
and your 4 servers
my four servers
right
i do have four now
the old two were replaced with two new
will be*
im working on codetools
im redoing the editor for like
the 3rd time
i may just make it a single page
that changes its layout based on the content
idk
then i would have to write js in excess of what i would like to
excessjs
watch out this is about to become a jamstack app
jrunner5 updates are basically almost done
success is standard here
oooo fancy
JSON.stringify is the standard around here
so securityexception wont always work
it throws a securityexception first time
and then it does weird stuff the next
hi cy
i am going to make a point
one sec
protobuf
json
this is a 15 argument test
um
you know you can like
json is
huge
firstly
its what like
1.5 kb
not even over a network
for a lot of traffic
and secondly
it's going to get bad
you can make jsons more efficient
…
by using shorter names
…
how
no
protobuf doesn't even use names
also
readability matters when doing thigns
protobuf is not readable
huh
json is readable
protobuf requires all this extra stuff
the protobuf
creates an object
which imo
is easier to use than json's dict indexing
imma go work on CodeTools
*continue
working
im done with the protobuf update
on codetools
ill test it a little bit more
ok
also cy
can you send me your emoji method
i can debug why it is throwing a server error
um
its not
wdym
hi my name is cy
and i tried to use JS spread syntax
and guess what
the
entirety
of
Google Chrome
came
to
a flaming
end.
welp
now i know how to instantly crash ppls browsers
wait
its working now
why is js so bad
im like how do i copy an object
emoji
long emoji
Welcome
try typescript maybe
meh
rn
i need to figure out
why
monaco
emoji
is not doing
can you send me the emoji method
language features
please
why
i want to
figure out
how big it is
and then figure out why it throws a server error
its the size
what happens is
its too big
yes
i want to see
that for myself
so the protobuf doesn't get fully transferred
and so
yes
the library throws an error
je veux voir
flask returns the 503 error page
ici
and then
non
js cannot parse it as JSON
and so it says
bad.
i just want it
here
for me to see
thank
um
wait ramesh
did you add timeouts
to jrunner5
no
do you want
a timeout feature
I can add one
yes
if you tell me how long
otherwise like
yeah yeah
um
timeout of like
15 seconds
k
uh
how do I crash it
ik
um
idk
what do you want
you can like
handle this exception
basically
you can also change the timeout
by changing a constant in the module
yes
also this thing gets really mad if you get a compiler error
on the solution method
no
um
ok
it just does undefined behaviour
imma fix that
k
this is basically gonna become
*cygh
why
the
heck is there even a resultType
cy
this is not a great design
methodResultType
solutionResultType
no i mean
compilerError
shouldn't the solutionResultType have a compiler error in the enum
um
both methodResultType
and solutionResultType
should be of type
RunResultType
*cygh
there is an outputresulttype
yes...
i was saying
we get rid of runresulttype
and only have an outputresulttype
and?
but
then
how do i know
if there was a compile error
we add
the compile error
to the outputresulttype
but there are 7 output results
or 0
wdym
or 5
or 10
or 20
no
or 2
it only does 1 output
or 4
if there is a compiler error
but
what if there are 0 inputs
that's not valid
yes it is
you can't just
they want to check
if it compiles
put an argument in
ramesh
you can add
Change it back
a solutionRunType
That was correct
or whatever
do what i said
cy's duolingo bird is coming to me
i dont
understand what you uhm want
can you like
tell me again
i want to know
if the code
compiles
atm
you can know if either one didn't compile
but you cannot tell whether it was the solution or the input
no i want to know both if they solution and if the input compiled
k so then
what im saying is
why do we need resultType then
there should be no results if the resultType is CompilerError
wdym no results
so it just
disappears
yes
what if I did
Error
instead
or just um
kept is as it is
i want to be able to do this:
and added
the compiler error to the output types as well
response.methodResultType
and see if it is success
or error
if it is error
i want a methodCompilerError
that i can read
um
what about
what I have now plus solution output type being compilererror
I will add a compiler error to the solution output type
which basically
enables you to do
what you asked for
um
send me the protobuf
before
k
um
why is CompilerError a thing here
it shouldn't be
also
get
so you know which one failed to compile
rid
of
the required
i will
they all fail
cuz its a compiler error
if its a runtime error
individuals can fail
true
if its a compiler error
the whole thing fails
yes
that is what is in place rn
it only returns one result
even if you input 15
with the compiler error info
should i write another protobuf for you
no
i just want to understand what is wrong with this
the compiler error
must be
in the root
wdym root
the top level
there is no level
there is one level
no
oh
asldkfjhalsdkjfh
i see what you mean
okay
ok
Again this still has that
send me the whole
protobuf
um
that's what we have rn
I see issues with it
no its not
such as
what if the solution is a compiler error
but the input is not
also wait actually
see
there's no point in this
you could just add a compiler error
to the output enum
a;sdlfkaj;sdlfkj
why
literally why
wdym why
this is the correct way
i dont see a difference between this
ramesh
the difference
is that
the compiler error refers to the code
and this
rather than the inputs
that's
why
it doesn't matter
you get one
output
no
remove all outputs
if it doesn't compile
then how do I relay to them
the message
this
of what didn't copmile
ah
there's no need for it to be in the root
unless like
its just more logical
i mean
i dont really think it is
besides
it's extra code
urs is like more lines than mine
the schema is more complicated
it is larger but less complicated
it makes sense
rather than being weird
if my code doesn't compile i wanna know why
if my code doesn't compile
it shouldn't just
run
one of my tests
and fail
and tell me
that my test failed
it should tell me that my code didn't compile
it does
tell you that your code doesn't compile
what if my code has no tests
that
wont work at all
no matter
what you do
but that needs to work
why
what if you just put in a dummy argument
no you cant do that
how does this joor thing work
i can compile it
it will just be
like why is putting a dummy argument not okay
what if the function divides 4 by that number
and that number is 0
then it fails
it wont run the function
if the function doesn't compile
why cant you compile
the function
oh btw
if it is empty
it will still return an output
with the empty stuff
or a compiler error if there is a compiler error
does that make sense then
no
if there are no inputs
there should be no outputs
no
I am trying to reuse stuff
ramesh
you have to compile the method right?
yes
ok
so
if the compile fails
say compiler error
put the error
then return
how hard is it
that is what
i was going to do
except the compiler error
is in the output
lemme write you some pseudocode
no
the problem is that whatever you want can already be done with this
its not about functionality
it might not be how you want to do it
its about logic
but it works
*sigh
i like logical solutions
that make sense
I think
it will make sense
so that when you want to change them
when you see it
later
its not
a nightmare
this code is already bad
also
i have to like
add a whole 'nother layer of logic for just compiling
with no args
you are telling me
it does not just
compile the code
then run it
it does
but it requires args
and you can just
the way it works is
omit the run part
it makes more than one
function
and each function
runs the method with arguments
and those methods
are in the class with the inputted method
so if you try compiling with no args
it will not compile
since the method that runs the input method with arguments
requires arguments
otherwise it throws a compiler error
so
its the java
that's doing each iteration
this won't compile
so basically
to do a compile check
i need to not add these methods
and try compiling and seeing what happens
then return that in an output
wait
why cant it just like
it generates
run tests
for each test
yes
so if there are no tests
it will not generate
the functions
hmm
to run the tests
yes this is possible
I am very illogical
and if there are 5
it will generate 5
in fact
it shouldn't generate tests
if the array is blank
so
the fields should be
optional
not required
lol
um
didn't i tell you like
last time
that's not
the same thing
as dont use it
fine
kotlin bad
im working on empty arguments rn
this is random
but i can probably call someone rn
um i can call i guess
if you want
if you gimme a minute
i guess we could talk about codetools
ok
one moment
why am I sameul
no
hold on i think theres still water in my mic *ppppfffftttt* *pppfffttt*
cy is updating windows atm 
then hes 
gonna go to best buy 
and buy RAM 
> and eat it 
yes
i had to like
 run ethernet through the walls
 to get to the furnace room
 but like coincidentally
 the router is right on the other side of the wall
 and coincidentally
 there is a hole
 in the wall
 just big enough for 2 ethernet cables
 so i ran
 the 2 ethernet cables
 and now
 it is on ethernet
cy is updating windows atm 
then hes 
gonna go to best buy

k i was worried u found it in normal user territory but u were in speshul user territory so its fine
idk
why
and then when I need to install software
yes
Perhaps
look i have antennas coming in the mail tmrw
I see
i think my parents take health concerns less seriously than social concerns
but without the e
but the problem is that i still need analog data
hands down

doing what they do
i solved this port forwarding issue

in terms of interfaces
s/
c/

s
/
Okay
/
/
/
/
no 
u just request 
5 times 
the api is really fast

//
idk probaly audio data

I'll get on at 703
/
/
/
k i was worried u found it in normal user territory but u were in speshul user territory so its fine
and if my face looks good
/
s
its because 2 of the videos i got were like 1 gb each
this year will be more challenging
so that means 30% of already 50%
/
ok
s
i already did that, Ramesh
english breakfast
its me
no

i had to like
 run ethernet through the walls
 to get to the furnace room
 but like coincidentally
 the router is right on the other side of the wall
 and coincidentally
 there is a hole
 in the wall
 just big enough for 2 ethernet cables
 so i ran
 the 2 ethernet cables
 and now
 it is on ethernet
k i was worried u found it in normal user territory but u were in speshul user territory so its fine

cy is updating windows atm 
then hes 
gonna go to best buy 
and buy RAM 
> and eat it 
yes
codetools
wait
what happened to codetools
:(
calum is ddosing my infrastructure
did calum
destroy it
kind of
because
my account
is full of shares
oh yeah lolol
cy gave me login
...
lol
Username/Password
um
haha 69 69 haha
lol
also playtools is dead
playtools is back up
but only with the help of cloudflare
playtools is too easy to ddos
*dos
i want to make a threaded tcp proxy that does what cloudflare does
and does robo checks
cy has an idea
i will embed rate limiting identifiers in the session cookie
these do not require db access
lol nvm i fixed it with NGiNX
i enabled rate limiting
lo and behold
calums software no longer works.
the problem is this:
what if they are at school
then what
right
hmm
well
what if you just
blocked non browser user agents
so that would be a starting barrier
because you can
*cough
change it
but
ddos it
from a browser
that's the easiest way
meh
just run that
in the console
and bam.
server dead.
the thing is
i want a really fancy system
that like
you could just like
does robo checks
5 second
requirement
like the
checking your browser thing
ramesh
for every page
that's not just a 5s delay
i k now
it's cloudflare
that is a js challenge
it tests to ensure you are a browser
no
theres also this
also you can just start 400 threads
then in 5s
also those dont always just pass through
they sometimes fail
and then you have to do a captcha
playtools already has a captcha
on the share viewer
it returns a required captcha every 20 requests
each worker will lock
after 20 requests
and then it requires a captcha
to unlock it
idk the school ip is hard
i think
if you tweak your rate limiting rules
it might still work
yes that is what im thinking
the thing is this
its min 0.1 rps per person
to run a player
unless you start playing and pausing
or loading content
or all that
so it ends up being more like maybe 0.5 rps
so that means
at 10 rps limit
20 users
can use it
although
if the client can just
retry
tbh other than the school issue
nginx rate limiting is highly effective
we are getting somehwere
its really fast
and nice
wtf
wait
the problem is like
i have to take the site off cloudflare
what the f
actual
what
the
function is not in the docs
but
it's there
or like the struct
i set the rate limit to 20 rps
with burst=15
it remains responsive with one client DOSing the server
and it should be able to accommodate at least 40 or so students
master branch time
cy
do you have any idea what I'm doing
Systems Programming
like
what specifically
dns
…
what
dns
no
idk
i am making a rust program
that deploys a nix file to a vm
lol what else is new
auto creating a nix vm
I see
no it's not startup
no it's not a vm
it's a domain
no it's not starting the vm
it's creating a domain
Now With CalumCan'tKillIt™ Technology
noooo\
lame
not lame
yes lame
good
it is good
ddos

ddos

so

now you need a whole ddos network to make it die
orrrr
i get access to ur house
and then just delet it
lol no that wont work
its not running at my house
like i said
its in Newark
ur house has ur pc
and ur pc has the access stuff
my pc is locked
dum
lolz
also the password to the vultr is not saved
i need to log into vultr
and copy paste
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
dammit cy is mad
there are no
http to https
redirects
asd;flasjd;fklaj
so it doesn't work
i need to fix that
i rely to much on cloudflare
lol ez
how so
linuxize?
song
ez such that that is fixed now
ramesh can UI design
that
font
no
nooo
i mean
tbf
this application is like
actually useful
if someone wants to use it
i like making my own everything
I do too
i wanna make a low level multithreaded tcp server
I did that already
for jrunner5
and multihangman (but thats udp)
i essentially want nginx
but mine
such that
i can implement
whatever i want
at the lowest possible level
i may work more on codetools
codetools is also about 0.5 rps max per person average
but it introduces a whole new set of funness
thanks
when I open the file picker
that is good
ungraceful wrapping
has been added
what is ungrateful wrapping
it does not look for spaces
it just
wraps
oh also ramesh
its like
broken
haha lol its not bork
i just
forgot that
arrays start at
0
yes
in protobuf
lol forgot twice
haha
i think it's really funny
that we just send random responses to each others' messages
that are like
off topic
and not responses
who are those three people
hi my name is cy
and i definately
can read that
m
that's
a you issue
it works
better
why is it having a compiler error
when all the outputs are valid
those tests did not run
nice
monaco at it again
ctrl f5
this is the dev server
so fun things happen
yes
QmR3WaYJEqiDAEqvt6JQ9oDKLr6esBtCuNardgJpBhYAem
its takin a hot second
why hot
it's some random japanese song
lol
wait actually
its "hot minute"
idk why
not "hot second"
idk
not loading
try
in the ipfs desktop client
no
im listening to other music rn
haha
calum spent like 45 mins at 4h
trying to replicate python requests.Session()
in javascript
so he could dos playtools api
this is
a weird cover art
um
ive seen weirder
i mean
the song is good
time to test the scalability of my solution
and add another tab
remember
each tab
has a different language
and has to autosave
what
about
i18n
what is that
internationalization
translation of your interface
nope
no
sorry
not
doing
that.
why wont the ssh library work
idk
there is literally no password
when I run ssh
there is no password.
then when I try to log in with no password
and I get a
cy is hungry
he did not eat dinner
the frozen pizza was so bad
that cy just
did not eat it
he also did not eat lunch
or snack
that said cy is sitting in a chair
doing nothing
so he doesn't need much to keep going
maybe
idk why this is broken
cy fixed it
he like
changed things
incorrectly
the codetools dropdown now has Test Challenge
which does some stuff
it was remarkably easy to implement this
thanks to my scalable code
i like this 404 page
done
ramesh is a rust fanboy
I use other languages too
I just want to get good at lower level
learn how to program microcontrollers
that's the most fun low level stuff
i was doing that at some point
where you actually modify the registers
and deal with buffers
and deal with interrupt tables
and flag bytes
bit masks
peripheral and clock management
eh
I am gonna learn assembly next
I got a book on it today
where you do have to modify registers fyi
idk i just feel like
assembly is low level
you get to play with memory addresses
low level is less relevant on OSs
jumping around
i want to write an OS
its actually relevant with microcontrollers
*sigh
cy finds a way to point out something is wrong with what I am doing
you can write a microcontroller os
eg
protobufs
assembly
etc
idk im just suggesting
i have like
zero interest in microcontrollers atm
but that may change because things
aka kitchen lighting
with light strips and esp32s
LoRa
since we like got a new kitchen
I might use MQTT
if I can figure out what that is
lol
its a pub-sub system
i mean
can you give an example
wdym
like
where would I use it for example
give a scenario
of what happens with mqtt
sending commands to IoT devices
yes
that is basically what I am doing
what about the sub part
well the device is subbed
and the user pubbs
but also
the device can send state data
hmm
this seems very useful
you could do health checks
that is
mqtt
what
protocol does it use
like is it tcp or udp
TCP
m
I see
Imma look into it
its remarkably easy
to use
in rust
um
what are you writing in rust
that uses mqtt
a qt
gui
oh
its probably not that hard
I installed Tasmota on my china plug
that way i could control it via MQTT
hmm
how much is a chinese plug
i want a chinese plug
so I can automate lights
$7
link
imma buy one rn
although
if you pay $9 more
you can get one with it all preconfigured
how do you flash the firmware on this again
cuz installing Tasmota on a china plug is not very easy
dont u have to like
disassemble it
well there are two ways
one is to dissasemble it
and solder wires to the ESP
k no
and flash it
thats out
the other way
is to use Tuya-Convert
which is this thing
that runs on raspberry pi
and hijacks the plug's auto OTA update system
i like that
now second question
is chinese plug safe
or is it something bigclivedotcom will disassemble to show how bad it is
my plug has not melted
idk it seemed fine to me
the construction was high kwality
oh also
hmm
continue
HomeAssistant is a thing
yes
idk i did not use that
i used Mosquitto
imma write my own software
like I always do
no Mosquitto as my MQTT server
then i wrote some software
wait does mqtt have to run on the plug too
i dont get exactly how mqtt works
you need an mqtt server
and mqtt clients
ah
my deployment tool 100% works basically
now
except my xml merge algorithm is having small issues
A recent Chromium update causes graphical glitches
having to do with the backdrop-filter rule
i know this is an issue with chromium
because
it affects chrome and edge
and i have seen it on multiple machines
firefox
has the same issue
no this is a different thing
the elements just
dissapear
go to playtools
or codetools
and mess with the header bar elements
or the run code button
which rely on GPU rendering
and you will see glitches
for example
the run code button
green lines will appear to the right of it
oh also this recent update just causes browsers to die
when reloading pages
this has now happened twice
have you tried
firefox
i have
does it have these issues
no
there is a logical solution
don't you like logic
Use Firefox.
firefox does not look nice
userChrome.css
the antialiasing is bad
the scrolling is bad
oh also
v8
*yawn
like
spidermonkey is fine
fancymouse.js
worked in v8
i bet if you made the same thing in firefox
like
but not spidermonkey
in firefox
tested it in firefox
then it would work
no i made it work in firefox
by lowering the refresh rate
then it worked
i didn't have to lower it that much
it still looked good
whatever
this works
cool
this
makes a vm
and installs nginx
and k3s
doesn't that seem useful
at all
what about my vm
yawn
i dont need this kind of ego boosting
it's fine
your vm
it exists
imma
yes
make a test server
k
and start deploying stuff to it
k
but i gotta add the most important feature yet:
emojis
lol
so you dont see
you see
yes
someone got bsd running on a m1
the nice thing about kodi is that it has basically chromecast support
since you can cast youtube videos to it
and whatever else kodi supports
Chromecast is nice cuz like
everything supports it
i mean
my parents literally only use chromecast for youtube
so i could probably get them on kodi and they wouldn't notice
minus
thing is like
installing the app
my dad got like
Disney plus
then he was like
i wanna watch it on my tv
then he was like
*sigh
time to install apps
and I was like wait
just chromecast
and the he chromecast
and then he happy
cuz he doesn't have to install apps on the tv
also then I get control
ah
from my phone
automatically
I think kodi can play disney+
are you sure
I am seeing
many companies were like
here
hi my name is unigram
you are typing and |
s s s | |s ss|s orry I died
kodi
i remember i used kodi once
idk
It got better
android tv is really nice
until it dies
and says
I wanted to try android tv on my pi
but the builds are broken
"WiFi is disconnected"
and then like
just doesnt
work
Chromecast is really nice tho
like
much nice
nvm
lol
i mean
the pi's gpu is like
so bad
although that said
kodi somehow managed to be fast
ik if i try and play a 1080p video in Raspbian it just like
does not work
but when i tried it in OSMC
it worked
kodi doesn't use x11
very well
that may be why
it like
uses gbm
which is more low level
idk i dont watch much tv
same
my brother and my dad watch tv
but i was thinking
I could replace our bluray player with kodi
we have an androidtv
and also a FiOS Cable STB
i do watch some tv
i watch the news with my parents
after dinner
mm
I have to do work
bye
NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt

hi im ebay
i hear you want an
iphone
i like microsoft edge
it lets me save my downloads to a custom location
so if i have to download 100gb of google data
but i only have 25 MB of space left on my main drive
i can save
it
do you use linux
to an external drive by clicking save as
no
i mean
yes
for my servers
but do you use THAT linux
the linux with that logo
no
‏hi ramesh
no
that did not work
hi ramesh
‏ so now i can type like thgis  and see it come out like that
thgis
‏ no just copy and paste my message into the send box
‏ this is quite fun i have to say
but it only works on some platforms
unicode is weird
oh
rtl
h4emuQVYqRMynNMYc
this website
looks good
whats the point of rust
like i dont get it
what is it used for
c dependency management is bad
so I don't use C
thus I use rust
but what do you make in rust
whatever you make in C
and C++
rust is more C++ than C though
so like computation stuff
I guess
and desktop applications
i mean
desktop applications
are not really
c
*cough
electron
Ok
Electron isnt that bad
All the electron apps run fine for me
electron is terrible
the worst garbage there is
the thing is
why use electron
just make a
website
What?
electron is just a website
with its own install of chrome
and so it means each electron app
has its own chrome runtime environment
where it runs a website
tbf vscode is electron
and its not bad
but as you can see
its literally chrome
yes
that is the one
good electron app
Google Git
Hmm?
tell me
how that is
not
balanced
Tf is ur AgI_3
Its just AgI
what
wait
ow wait
silver is that one element
that is 1+
in the transition metals
I think so
Idk i just know silver usually isnt solluable
I remember now
Good job
Idek what charges the transitions r
lemme see if changing it to AgI works
Ugh i have a quiz tmrw on this stuff
And i do not remember anything
i hope i dont have a quiz
i mean
this webassign
is due
tuesday
Pretty sure everyone has a quiz
So urs is prob most likely on tuesday
Unless pernia is nice
And didnt give un quiz
who's in my class
do we have a quiz?
lol akash probably muted this channel
does my expression convey my level of surprise
Nope
lol i forgot
theres a calendar
U have a quiz?
no
Wait
That says calendar
I cannot read
lol
Um
What
Yea no way a tests next week
i do not know when my test is
apparently word 2021 is gonna have a document dark mode
so white documents
become dark grey
Huh
I mean my pdf viewer does that
cuz like
the document is the main source of eye searing brightness
Oh those ions on the bottom r nice
i convinced my dad to buy me storage
i said it was "for school"
because zoom said
"you are low on storage, and that might cause interruptions"
and zoom is a school thing
right?
Um
Nice one ig
How
Did u manage this
Im still so astounded
how much u have
Idk 256 i think?
i have 512
I download random stuff
And i still have like 70gb left
i have 62.6 MB left
i like how when windows runs out of storage i cant like
save my code
but
i can still do like
really complex things
it hits 0
like a literal no joke 0
...
like you dont understand
0 bytes
like
like i said
i add one character to my code
ctrl s
save error.
Damn
Idk
its going down my the minute
I havent ever had low storage issues
Like once i dropped to 30gb left i think
And i ran my software
my phone has a similar issue
And i got back up to 80
Um
Why dont u back up ur videos
To like somewhere else
the majority are on the SD card
i could just move them to the SD card
or like get a bigger SD card
i have a storage issue
i just like
fill storage
Idk i think my phones also pretty low
lol but you have 4x less storage than me
But apple just offloads apps i dont use
I never have any storage issues
Ever
even my extra space is filling up
Why dont u
Clean the drives
Like ya know delete stuff u dont need
Or clear some caches and log files
tbh idk what is even taking up my space
Mabye rebuild some indexes
lol wtf windows
It’s going down
yes
By the minute
there was this time
i was in a French supermarket
in france
and i looked at the price
on the price tag
and then
the price just like
went up
before my eyes
and i was like
wait
hold up
wait
that price
just changed
Or u may have thought it was a certain price
I never had that happen to me in a French supermarket in france
lol
no but then like
one second
I am downgrading nixos rn
so I can cachix
so you dont have to wait 2 hours for launchnix to build
Yay
What is cachix?
Is that just like a way to use the nixstore for files?
i took a closer look at the price tag
and i was like
that price tag is thic
Ooo
Is that eink?
then i looked at the one next to it
and its battery was dead
and i was like
wait
it has a
^
Looks like eink
yes
it is
Thats cool
My French supermarket in france was boring
It did have a mcdonalds across the street from it tho
That was fun
lol
but then like
idk
it was like
Wait
the first time i saw electronic price tags
How do u charge them?
idk
also they had lots of different types
Does someone have to like plug it in?
some big ones
some small ones
some long ones
Fancy
also
there were ones in the freezers
and i could tell
they were not enjoying themselves
in the freezer
they were like really faded
and burned in
Oh god
Eink was burned in?
Thats a feat on its own
no eink has memory
and you have to clear it
but it gets increasingly hard to clear the physical memory of the display
the colder it gets
cuz it relies on the movement of suspended particles
in a gel
in a membrane array
in the display
its called electrophoretic display technology
yes
a microencapsulated electrophoretic display
aka e-ink
another brand of tags
in another store
these are RF
as opposed to the Pricer ones
which were IR
Li-Fi
this is the kind of thing the Europeans do
idk why
but this is the kind of thing they do
they update the prices of groceries in real time
so they can make the most profit
and its clearly worth it
cuz why else would they spend money on these tags
i mean do you understand how many items there are in the store that need tags
thousands
Of course
Make it seem cheap
Lure someone
Change the price when they blink
lol
Stonks
yes
wait we hit 0
Yay
Happy new year
lol
at least it cant create any more crap
that i have to delete
wait
what if i could like
dynamically resize my drive
so it always has 0 bytes left
until i need storage
Um
I dont think u can do that
Thats more like for ram
maybe i should decrease my swap now that i have 32GB ram
*cough
idk
my new ssd arrives wednesday
its a Samsung
unlike my current store brand one
my laptop had the fastest SSD
it was from like 2017
but it was 2017's best ssd
but it was 256gb
and i was like
larger than 256gb
so i replaced it
along with the battery
and the screen
and the thermal paste
I replaced it with a Sabrent Rocket 3
imma do some kemistry
bye

No thats worse right?
yes its worse
its cable tv
Yea its not good
1080 is also ehh
4k is where its at
its interlaced
1440p is also nice
p is progressive
i is interlaced
progressive
yes

how so
all the other groups did very well
and they had sources

and like
twice as many people
my "group" does not have as many sources
that's fine

yes
can you solve the challenge
let me do it

oh
i may add that to the draft/publish feature of the challenge editor
i changed the description reload
ah
you removed it from the js
removed what
the solution output
yes
so
how am I supposed to solve it then
read the instructions
yes
make it
a + 10
imagine it saying 10
reload the page maybe
but you did 1
lol i did
lemme make one
cy
make the description use markdown
then i need a markdown converter
yes
python has one
i used it in flim
my forum
a client side one
tbh i probably could make it md
no
do a server side one
ramesh
it will turn the md into html
explain to me
that's what I did
how a server side one
oh
wait im dumb
lol
when calling render_template
use the server side renderer
ok no
just use a client side one
does markdown do images
yes
also
does the starter code method name have to have a description
wdym
no
does it have to be
myMethod
yes
k
for now
k
how do I share
url bar
reload I made a change
to what
wait
im making another one
you can only change the description and the solution after sharing
i changed an input
no
that will not update
not until i enable publishing
i can tho
go in the database
how do I make another one
and delete my editor
you dont
not yet
im making a new acc
1 sec
i mean i can make you one
if you want
a new one
under the same account
can you
i want
ok
hold on
lol
try it
did you get it yet
um
i broke it by making an infinite loop
hold on
did you try recursion
also imma fix this
so the timeout is 15
or 30
and you get a Timed out on every input
i am trying to do it recursively
but
it is too slow
^
i could just do it with a loop
meh
well do it then
nice job
lol so neither of us can do a fibonnacci
I did it
see
lol got it finally
no
3
…
you copied my code
mine is better
what is yours
i did mine very lazily
its the same
mhm
actually
it could be even better
um
i mean
sure
i was gonna have it done in 2 lines
but your tests
that wont work
yes i know
gee talk about terrible code
it expects you to have stuff in this place
/var/www
this SHOULD NOT BE PUBLIC
it's like
full of personal information
idk what
it's just AWFUL
i am trying the fib again
a different way
with arraylists
that uses less code
let me guess this has a personal password
encrypted with md5
which is insecure
cy forgot how to use ArrayLists
now time for the injection
*2
how to end up at stack overflow
what did you do
oh
i thought it said securityexception
WAIT
WHY IS IT NOT RED
ITS SUPPOSED TO BE RED
THE ARROW IS NOT RED
wait
it was
a security exception
Ramesh
xPlane to me why this is happening
wdym
oh
ik why
it returns security error for any "system" exception
lol you know whats funny
this app may allow NoSQL injection
$10 if you can NoSQL inject my server
i just realized
hmm
time to start doing research
that was assigned a month ago
and is due wednesday
Thats procrastination at its greatest
cy joined the Office insider program
aka he now has dark theme
and now Word has another advantage over Google Docs
it does not sear your eyes
It doesnt look awful
Its a nice grey
Opposed to a harsh black
i mean i would have preferred a darker grey
Eh it works
yes it works
They should let u choose
the shade of grey?
Yea
i mean they do
its either white
ugly as hell
or this
3 options
white looks the best
but its white
true
wait
on dark mode
highlight something
i wanna see how it looks
with colors
like highlighter it
oh highlight
ah yea it looks eh
*cough
tf is that
this is with dark mode
k imma leave now
have fun
so i dont have to see that
also i should do homework
cough
idk i like the color
ah yes u should do it
i hate how there is no smooth scrolling tho
that pisses me off royally
imma go eat dinner actually
bye
adios
LibreOffice: Somewhat Dark Mode
word had somewhat dark mode
now it has allwhat dark mode
time to fix my storage issues
Oooooo
uh oh no no no
what
What?
i dont like acronis
imma use macrium
lol this new ssd is already getting real toasty
and it doesn't even have a partition table yet
Um
Put a heatsink on it
its in air rn
Make sure to remove the blue sticky stuff on the nvme things on ur motherboard
Um
Thats
....
Use nvme as a flash drive
i can use my old one as a flash drive
i have to clone rn
ow i just touched it
its hot
Kinda figured
they like being at 40 c
Is it like the chip on an rpi
yeah more or less
maybe a little hotter
imma wire up a fan
cloning at 2 gbps
225 MBps
Thats fast
well i mean these drives can do like
Thats fast
There we go
3 GBps
it would probably have been faster to do it from the direct slot on the motherboard
but like
imma test something
imma hibernate windows
then replace its boot medium
no that wont work
Hi cy
Use
Clonezilla
Works like a charm
so does macrium
you just say
clone this drive
and it says
ok
Clonezilla is not commercial
idrc as long as it works
Yes
I would use clonezilla
Since it works
im already using macrium
And i know it works
But u use macrium
Is fine
Also why get a samsung
idk my dad was like in a hurry and hes like
haha
samsung gud
samsung best seller
samsung in cart
I got a sabrent rocket
i did too
i have 2 of those
…
i mean
i have an inordinate amount of ssds
like uncountable how many I have
i have one which is my secondary drive for my pc
I just have spare ssds lying around everywhere
and one which is for my laptop
they are 2.5 tho
like I have a pny ssd
another kingstone ssd
like
5 of those
kingstone
and then I have a sandisk ssd
and the sabrent
then another one from a laptop
i will have some spares
and some others
i have the old one from my laptop
which is really fast
but its really old
its like 4 or 5 years old
cy see
and i will have the one in my PC
which is the MicroCenter storebrand
ah
I also have an intel ssd
storebrand dish detergent
in my mac mini
storebrand ssd
inland
Inland
yes
i dont need huge speed
but like
this
yes
idk I didn't want to spend money
so I just got a sabrent
yeah same with my previous ones
the new gen 4 ones can do 7GBps
the samsung 980 pro
iperf
no
hdparm
well have fun with it
yes
it will probably boot fast
no my boot time is consumed
i can get to zoom in my vm
by my BIOS
in less than one minute
taking its sweet time
to POST
yes same
but something random happened
it takes like 10 seconds
to post
and my computer stopped taking 1 minute to post
it would literally sit there for a minute
should i update the bios
yes
but it will delete all your bios settings
lol like i have any
i do
for XMP
and AMD SVM
should i get a ryzen 5000
yes
no i should not
the performance boost
is incredible
i dont need it tho
get a 5600x
so
then you can build another server
with ur current cpu
my computer is pretty fast
Server
i should do hw
yes
I will too
bye
i have a 6000 word interview
yes
bye
and i have to turn it into an oral history report
*sigh
bye
*cough
*yuck
the amount of dust
in that computer
*asdfnaLSDKJEC
im like
eating it
its in my mouth
however a problem has been solved
old
new
this
jsdksdf;jfdljkfdsjklsfd
cy is a trator
confirmed
cy its me akash and benjamin chee
its like ied - christan + akash
okay
so
cy
you have to filter an expression
or a string
hi ramesh I know why it didn't work
i think i successfully deleted it
…
did you
back up in github
like
download it
now
before you push it
then pushed it
but
not in like the file manager
vscode has it
make 100 copies of it
so it only deleted previous versions
okay
good
also now you can specify the timeout time
no not yet
time to make it public?
yes
ill check it too
after I finish apush
and jrunner
now we know you are a child.
let's stalk you.
lol
has been updated
has been updated
protobufs were updated btw
so you have to look at that
optional
yes
c'est le temps de faire apush
adieu
please understand i will have 0 time today perhaps
but now that it is public you can make the changes
lol
should I make a competing codetools frontend
sure
see tbh idk if I want to lol
lol
didn't think so
maybe
imma change my mind
no
you will not
write it
in rust
I will
how is rust supposed to work on frontend
wasm
also
no
I will be contributing
this will not use
wasm
becuase i dont feel like reinventing the wheel
also
we should use nixos to deploy this
can I tell you why
why
you can write the deployment
in a git repo
and then
you add one line to the default configuration
and it will deploy
the entire
application for you
ok
and then
but i have to do the whole thing
when you update the deployment
it will just pull it
and work
this
also imma write it
so
it's fine
so get ready to explain
everything
nix has a very
and have me write it
deep learning curve
no
it's
painful to learn
also it's not like any programming language you've seen
well then we will not be using it
no we will
i will be writing it
and I will tell you
how it works
and then you can contribute to it
if i cant write it
it's not that hard
if
i dont wanna have to deal with it
you actually have documentation
eg. me
i need to be able to run this and work on it when i do not have access to you
yes
and thus
I will teach it to you
i must write
the config
and do the install
and all that
so you may teach me
yes
but also
im thinking jrunner5
will be distributed
ipjrunner5
*sigh
therefore
we can handle
lots of requests
i mean
if you can manage that
and have it be reliable
yes
and cost effective
I will do that
it will use haproxy somehow
load balancing?
and maybe wireguard
but ill make it easy
once again
i should know
everything
what
for jrunner5?
i need to know how it works
that is my software
if you wish
if its gonna be in my software
i mean
i dont know how half the things work in my software
but if you really want fine
i just
need to figure out how to render challenges
but like if i wrote a bunch of code that is vital for your service
and didn't tell you how it worked
and it was not the way you would have done it
and your service has to have 100% uptime
true
what if I maintain the jrunner5 part
and if i was graduating 1 year before you
and you maintain the other part
but I will tell you how it works if you want
i gtg to math bye
bye
this
hmm
right
it doesn't work
whatever
idk
ill deal with it later
ok
why wont this work
what wont work
i cant center text
horizontally and vertically
it works on one monitor
LATeX LOL
css
not latex
oh css
then i can help you
send me your problems
flexbox
solves all problems.
i was doing transform
no NO
stop
send me the code
i will fix it
wait lemme try flexbox
ok
if that doesnt work ill send
ok
nope
send alla code
i fix code
using my extensive knowledge of flexboxes
have fun trying to fix that one
um
how should i test it
it has like a million calsses
are security exceptions
without the html
handled at all
its sent
the font wont work for u, just try it without it
wait
centered vertically?
yes
ok hold on
it should be dead center of the page
this is what i see rn
right?
thats what i get
ok
on my mac
on my monitor its somehow kinda centered
lemme fix it hold on
what color should timeouts be
red?
yes
k
I need to find a way to set the timeout
and put it into mongo
yes
also
WHAT IS THIS CSS
haha
he
i was just copying stuff
idk
yeah
see
that i had the priviledge
should I get the venn diagram
lol
it might be insulting
akhil is the left
yup
100%
also this doesn't work on mobile
just letting you know
yea ik
mobile is really annoying
ill get that working later
vertical centering does not work on mobile
in any way shape or form
unless you are making a PWA
it will always be off center
well i can horizontally center it
lol
so it should be fine
ok
oh also
that solution wont work in firefox
i forgot the firefox magic tags
just add
um what
to your body css
cy
why did you use
main
not master
*yawn
cuz that's what it defaulted to
yeah
i dont like that
i will intentionally keep using master
it said use main
not master
i am a luddite
yeah
since main is inclusive language
leader/follower ✔
now to figure out
how to
mongodb
and CyUI
lol
dont break it
or do anything differently
I am not breaking it
since I like
from how i do it
i wont
at some point though
I may force you to switch to mongoid
no
like
the orm
meh
we will see later
as in
i will do it for you
no
you will not do anything
for me
hard fork
that i do not understand
do you not understand
the timeout should just be a constant
no
i want people to be able to set it
for performance reasons
are you in a class rn
but it will have a default
no
can we call
wait
no
why
I cannot
wdym
I can't
call you
its like literally school
as if you are in a class
no
*smh
tell me this
why can't teachers
set timeouts
if they want to measure performance
ok fine
add it to the challenge object
and we have a default
I will
the challenge object should have no timeout
unless
if I can find
the
it is explicitly set
place
to add it to the ui
well rn the ui has no config box
nvm
i think i found it
also
make your code nicer
lol
its not done
i mean
it's probably better than akhil's
lol
its not done
yeah
why cant you call
i wanna see what you are doing
to my app
i can call
in a few minutes
ok
did you really set it to not reload templates
?
um
idk
fine
i would like to see the changes you are making
so if they break
i know how to fix them
im
coming
wait
my
microphone
wait
wait
tell me
what to do now
since I reattached my webcam cy
one moment
um
it works on the solution end
also the configuration must disappear if the user is a user
yes
I figured that out
no
not that
i have to inglish
bye
bye
JFYI
The testchallenge
nvm
imma fix it
merge it
i dont like some of the changes
but i can merge it
such as what
can we call
no
what
is it
i dont like typing
i have to do something soon
and i wanna show
so that's why I cannot call you
*sigh
like
the
idk i already forgot
well then
ill just merge it its dine
what like
the
site key thing
well theres that
that is a good thing
what else
i would rather that be a template filter
i tried that
but
I can try again if you want
like I get why
make it such that anywhere i wanna use the site key
i just call site key
and not have to pass it in
yes
ok ill add that
what else
also there were some other things but i have to run it to ensure they are bad
imma merge it
k
ill make another pr for the template filter
ok
ramesh it is dying
it cant find the timeout
wdym
hold on
imma fix it
is this a schema thing
oh
i bet it's
it is
hold on
what
it is that
uhm
you forgot to copy a new
protobuf
?
no
something is old about your jrunner5
yes
you must pull a new jrunner5
yeah the other problem was you messed up the modal
the animation doesn't work anymore
right
but just setting opacity
lemme fix that
does not work
yes it does
oh
try it
the two modals
overlap
and when you try clicking on change title
it tries to change the configuration
hold on
idk if template filters are it
also i gtg
bye
bye
mongo bad
Ah yes
Not mango
Avacado
this is hilarious
LaTex
in webassign
Lmao
I gotta figure out how to do some stuff with nix
I need to figure out a better secret deployment method
welcome to honors precalc
it all comes back around
ah hell yes
wait
2=2?
thats crazy
TRIGUNUHMETRIK EYEDENTITEES
yes
they r very cancer
no i like them
now the question is this
i have 3 things i have to do
write an English essay for tmrw midnight
um
do the social studies research that was assigned a month ago
and is due tmrw 7:30
do 40 math problems to study for quiz tmrw
10 are already done
LIFE DURING WWII
CIVILIAN LIFE DURING WWII
GERMANY DURING WWII
WWII WIKIPEDIA
ANYTHING
PLEASE
i think
imma start
with that
bye
ah im dying kinda
ah have fun
what is gatsby
react
ah
but kinda
i should learn react
well i mean gatsby super fricken ez
u just give it html
its a fancy JSX language or smthing
i see
i need to figure out how to draw fricken boxes in html/css
div
border: 2px black;
they have to be like rectangles
filled
background-color: black;
huh
i was just gonna svg everything
or that
but like
you can put stuff in divs
and they auto resize
if you need that
ill prob put svgs in divs
why
do you need
blocks
idk
if you need a rectangle
use a div.
do not use an svg.
<div id="rectangle"></div>
ah wait
thats
way easier
what
using divs
stop using ids
use class
not id
id is bad
yea i will
especially for this
thats example code
that i found on the internet
ok
^^literally written by a 7 year old
I cant even read it
Its getting flagged by my content blocker things
lol
its not a virus
its just like
so wrong
Tell that to adblock
that it is dangerous
Haha
Uh what?
Wait
Is this an ad for a really garbage wifi repeater?
noooo, wait is it
wait was it misleading me
Yes it totally is
Its about a wifiblast
i totally was hooked by that thing
it was gonna change my life
why you gotta be like this akhil...
Haha
Oh trust me
It still will
Its a magical device
tbf
it probably works fine as a wifi repeater
Yea
But i would not buy it
Id get like a reputable brand
Like tp link or smthing
its $6
Um
Its 6$ + like 5 more bucks
Cause its the wrong outlet
oh
Plus tax
Plus customs
Itll be like 19$
WAIT WHAT
Its 40$ on their website
Sorry
39.95
Thats a bargain
Oooo
Yes
I like to pay 1 cent
Where does it ship from?
Actually shipping would prob be like 2$
$0.01 + free shipping
heck yes
its a box
its also my demise
*coughs
that
and another reason
wdym no its a totally legitimate brand
whos comcast?
lol
all ik it comfast
i did it
im an idiot
whats the fcking difference between positioning relatively and fixed
um
everything
ramesh wants to run his rust code on an Xtensa CPU
and he found a rust compiler that would compile to Xtensa
Whats xtensa?
a cpu architecture
Wait
Espressif released the ESP32-S3
ESP-IDF has its own mesh networking protocol
i think that is what we were using at the hackathon
the ESP-MESH protocol
so firefox
they finally
had a brain
and added this
You dont understand.
I just
used
windows RDP
over an esp8266
like my 50 cent microcontroller
broadcast a wifi network
acting as an ap
and a router
and i used windows RDP over it
120 MHz tensillica Xtensa
240 kb ram
lol "quarter of a megabyte of ram"
no.
32kb ram
lol "120 MHz"
no.
80 mhz.
i like percents
I see
superfast
that's like Gearbest
it tells you
this product will ship in 3 weeks
then theres a button
"Expedite Shipping"
you click it
and it says
this product will ship in 1 week
um what?
u dont pay extra for expedited?
no you just click that button
and the shipping time just like
changes
quick
what do i put
bill wurtz
which one?
Long Long Long Journey
all lowercase
oops
ooh no pe
mr howards computer wont work
Lucky
i think that's what he said
so
hes like on his phone and hes glitching out
i realllly wanna set up WebRTC
I realllly wanna get the webpage to work
i know web design
so send me things
and i can help you
I will in a bit
I wanna see how to do relative
Cause fixed is nice
oh relative
relative lets you use fixed
But some things r kinda off
but in boxes
so
what you do
is you make a div
make it position relative
and then make more items
put them inside
and make them position absolute
then use top left bottom right
Hmm
magic
why className?
gatsby needs className
not class
i see
does the same thing
i really need to learn one of these frontent frameworks
its nice
lol yellow
no kidding
cause u can do components and stuff
yeah
ooo
i should have done codetools in one of those frameworks
mabye
actually
depends on how codetools is
if it runs client side gatsby works wonders
if its server try next.js
its mostly client side
this then
it has a web ide i think
i wanna use react
cuz i really need to bind things
they all use react
its that some do things a bit easier
and allow u to use like sudo html
pseudo?
yes but sudo
no
but
idk
i love
the pages feature
any js u put in pages
becomes a page
are you in a class rn?
i mean yes
but its gym
lol
but shes about to let us leave
so
if you wanna call
after she lets you leave
sure
i need to get an svg to load in gatsby
oo we using cycloud now
yes
um
tf is this
wdym
i dont see u
hold on
reload the page
rejoin the call
make a call
speak
i cannot hear u
lol
this is why
we use anything but cycloud
it worked flawlessly with ramesh
also check ur speakers
cuz my mic is working
my speakers r working
check ur speakers
my mic
is working
lol i muted you
yes ik
how come
idk
i can choose a microphone
but not a speaker
join the google meet
Dr P:
They inject you with Technicium. It's quite fun!
It's better than having to drink Barium Sulfate...
I have to use an android vm
to add
a spotify song to the apcs playlist
really spotify
lol
why cant you use linux
I can
but I don't want the app
on my computer
lol that's ur problem then
they disabled the feature
on the website
Remember
I don't use spotify
what did you do
Jrunner5 literally like
nothing
caused my computer to be so slow it couldnt even register key presses
how did this happen
i dont know
but actually
did you spam it
i think this has been happening a lot
no
i did nothing
and actually
yesterday
this same thing happened
where my input became laggy
are you sure it's
but i didn't check the task manager
jrunner5
and
it is
that should not be happening right?
not some other java application
because
#1
i dont run any other java applications
and
#2
i stopped jrunner5 and now all is well
well
it might not be closing threads properly
probably
maybe
idk run a jrunner5 continuously for a while
like 2 days
ah
and see if you see the same thing
wait
and send it some jobs
let me
send it like
500 jobs
but like
no jobs were sent to this one
like very few
like
20 maybe
has this always been happening
well like i said
a few days ago right
it caused my input to become laggy
like realllly laggy
but actually
yesterday
my input got laggy
not as laggy
but laggy
which it never does
k imma run a bunch of tests
and i started this instance yesterday
so it seems to gradually get worse
that makes not much sense
unless
the threads are not dying
lets call
and talk
no
why
dont feel like it rn
i may in a few minutes
ok
now once this is done
if it does not decrease
then I think I know the problem
oh also it was only using 1MB ram
look at the screenshot
yes
becuase it is compiling atm
now it uses 0 cpu
no in my screenshot
yeah im trying to find out why
it is no longer sending jobs
and this is happening
Jython
*sigh
why kotlin
this is a threading issue
not a kotlin issue
if you don't do threads right in any language this happens
idk its probably easier to do threads right in python
no
so like this
um whats up with the 718 MB ram
idk
in mine like i said
it hasnt run the gc yet perhaps
it was 1MB
i suppose
you should find out how to consistently reproduce it
to have this state
ok
lemme try some things
so i just run it 10 times
each time the cpu usage goes up by 10%
also i think you're right about the gc
cuz mine was at 250MB when i tried it this time
should i run it and wait
it might take a while
i stopped it
should i do it again
and see if the ram goes down
after some time
no im not interested in ram
im interested in cpu
ok
my computer is getting slow
it like
the threads do not close
hmm
wiat
wait
wait
wait
umm
ramesh has idea
Google Earth runs on WASM
So
if you
use a while true
it doesn't close a thread
but if you do a normal thing
without a timeout
it does close a thread
which is interesting
so then
make the timout
timeout
while loops
and destroy the thread
yes
see
correct
I have to do some investigation
so now we have the issue
ok
we shall try to fix it
i just realized
if it was written with Jython
you could like
manage the whole thing from within one application
no TCP
no protobufs
it just calls a function
would have a java running component
um
no
unless flask works on jython
wdym
jython is a python library
no
wait
no
wait
wait
wait
wait
can i call you
yes...
one moment
same
eye am ready
join
nextcloud
yes
fine no
we can do it here
wdym
just like
wait
i gtg
hi
i can text
i cant speak
do this:
find a java/kotlin mqtt client
k
then
then
make it do something
like
i forgot exactly i have to check
then use MQTT explorer to see if you can send/recieve
ok…
then the whole thing will be run on mqtt
no more TCP server
so that means
the jrunner client needs no open ports
ok
ill look into it
i actually really like this idea
we should call about it later
cuz like all you have to do
is start a jrunner thing
and it will automatically allocate and balance and do everything
explain to me how mqtt works
just like you want me to explain how nix works
its the simplest thing on planet earth
tell me what pub sub is
listen to me
ok
so
i recieve "hello"
does this make sense?
yes
what about this
if I publish "hello" to test1
how do I read
hello
does it poll
no
no polling
it holds open a tcp socket
then
ah
then
how does one
like
what I get from how jrunner5 will work is
someone pushes something to jrunner5
i will explain to you later i have a whole plan
i have to do english
k
by e
it is inherently unsafe to run Thread.stop()
Do not use this if you want your program to work.
thread.stop()
thread.join
thread.jion
if thread.running
dijion
thread.stop
la france
I can call
and tell you my plan
or i can meet with Mayukha
if you do not respond within 20 seconds
i will meet with mayukha
I will meet with Mayukha
bye
Springs are annoying
I have solved the annoying thing
by stopping threads
It works.
the cpu pinning should no longer happen
thread stop is safe for my use case
i can call now
i finished with mayukha
Me? I am busy
wdym
i thought you wanted to know the plan
for the mqtt scheme
Not now
when
Not today
Or if today
Via text
ok
i might do some things with it
myself
or maybe ill just do the java implementation
actually
K
i might just do that
Wdym
to learn this kotlin stuff
so i understand it better
If you want
ok
imma eat snack bye
satisfying animations
i have to watch that for spanish
i do not want to
actually
it will not be MQTT
WebSockets are better for this purpose
lol i have to watch a French yoga HIIT workout video and follow along with it
and it has to be longer than 20 minutes
so uh...
what
cuz it involves knowledge of who is "online"
and data translation
so it works out better to do it all with a websockets server
cuz you get more fine grained control
and so its more efficient
the problem
is that jrunner5 should not be a websocket server
no
its a websockets client
so how does this work
there is a management server
that replaces MQTT/Mosquitto
and it does all the code running
so the client connects to this server
and when they wanna run their code
they place a run request to the server
then the server opens a thread
finds their code in the MongoDB
then sends that code to one of the jrunner5 clients
im not sure if this is necessary
then ends
what is a gunicorn "worker"
then
an instance of your app
so like
its as if
and used Haproxy to load balance them
so then
how will a ws server
improve performance
no its for that distributed thing
no
so the server is in my house
No
or in yours
No
or at school
This is
for
unnecessary
not for
just
i already had an idea on how to do this
that requires no code changes
what was this idea
one sec
k
whatever the solution is it has to be lightweight
it is more or less
but not 100%
it runs a vpn server between all the nodes
no
bad
and then haproxy balances the vpn
no
no
i can use
hole punching
over a vpn
no
that is so
why
inefficient
why is it inefficient
because you dont need all the capability of a VPN
or of HAProxy
you just
need to tell clients
hey heres code to run
yes
and they need to say
how do you plan on doing this
hey server
here is the output
websockets
no
no
stop
why is this bad
no NAT hole punching
because
there is
a trivial solution
called websockets
web sockets are not trivial
yes they are
also
they are like 20 lines of python
where is the load balancing
done
with your websocket solution
it is done on the management server
if i could call
no
this would be explained faster
but ok
no
so
also
why
why what
write your own load balancing algorithm
over haproxy
that is a bad idea
no
listen please
ok
so
this is the chain of events
next
A jrunner5 client wherever it is
enjoy your supervisord
anyway continue
connects to the managementWS
the managementWS adds it to its list of runners
^^ repeat as many times as you want
then next
a client
a user
opens the page
they connect to the managementWS
then
they send a run request, along with a contentID
the managementWS
at this point
starts a thread
contacts mongoDB
gets the code
then
formats it all nice
then
it selects from its set of jrunner clients
Okay
continue
and sends the run request
I have refined my idea
to the jrunner client
then ends the thread
then
when the jrunner client is done
it sends a message to the server
saying
im done, heres the result.
ok
then
because its a custom server
it can read the content type
and if it is a challenge_editor
it can go
and save the match output
in the mongodb
otherwise
simply pass that response back to the user
ok
now can I
I have changed my idea
ok...
slightly
basically you have one endpoint
and then
which then
wait bad
one sec
yes
so you need
a master client
and the master client will basically send a request to your jrunner5
which is the same thing as you said except I wouldn't use websockets
wait
what is the master client
the master client is a separate thing
can you guide me through the whole thing
it is basically a sieve
like i said for mine
im still thinking
one sec
oh also
with mine
the jrunners are hot swappable
at any time any one can connect or disconnect
and as long as there is at least one
yes I know
okay so
the master node basically has a bunch of open connections to jrunner5 servers
the jrunner5 servers when started will connect to the master node
then the master node basically does load balancing
I would like to offload this to some other library
maybe haproxy can be a master node
but basically then it sends the data into the connection
and out comes the result
then it acts like a jurnner5 server
as we have it now
and just returns the protobuf
so i see
but
what is this "master node"
it does not run jrunner5
it is a lightweight server to literally just load balance
but
how does it connect to jrunners
the clients connect to it
no jrunners
how does it connect to jrunner instances
it has an open tcp connection to every one of them
so then you have to change the jrunner code
the connection is just
Im assuming this is client side load balancing right?
open
yes
no
but then
ah nice
it's server side load balancing
heres another question
hold on
so
can you like i said
guide me through
i wanna analyze
im still a bit skeptical of the advantages
I did
of this solution
websockets seem bloated
tcp is more low-level
no
is this a kubernetes model kinda?
websockets are essentially tcp
not really
with what on top
but they deal with like
the size
and stuff
so like
they allow you to more easily initiate
and
I can probably deal with that too
it seems not hard
well hold on
so
websockets
are just tcp
but
they dont have that size issue
yeah
also
so what is the advantage
they work in web browsers
if I just add that thing
and they have apis
and i think
the thing is
kotlin
the server
is doing
has a built in
websockets api
the server is sending ws requests
so
no with my solution
does nothing
with code running
that is all dealt with by managementWS
i think
it would be better
if you took my master server and then added the websocket idea to that
well there is
but it shouldn't mongodb
our ideas are very close
heres the difference with mine tho
a run request
does not lock up a thread
because
it just asks for the code to run
then
stops the thread
so it is asynchronous
yes
that would have to be implemented differently
right
yes
well
but like
im not sure there will be a perf improvement
it would not be an HTTP
well
maybe
well the idea is not to be a performance improvement
but to be a reliability and load improvement
k
for a performance improvement
maybe
stay with current solution
im just like
is there anything slightly lower level over websockets
wdym
since idk if websockets send bytes
they send strings
no
they send
whatever
are you sure
yes
although
also
there are things here
like the client
it depends on what library you use
directly gets the protobuf
no
they do not
managementWS
handles that
then
also
there is no performance improvement
over
did i say there was?
no
no the improvement like i said
is in
load balancing
and reliability
I mean
so if a jrunner fails
there are more
not
Client →  (WS) managementWS → (WS) Jrunner5
but
then
the asynchronous model doesn't work
cuz how should the client know when their run has completed
when
without holding a thread
well
managementWS is another thread
just a different process
ramesh
the client
ok my code is running now
now what?
the client sends runcode
wdym
response
200 OK
the same thing
it does rn
i dont think there is a major improvement
in async
but that blocks a thread
so what
it can still make more threads
it's not limited to four threads
i dont think that's how gunicorn works
in fact
workers ≠ threads
it says specifically
slow clients
will lock up your server
in the gunicorn docs
and so it says
use NGINX
to buffer them
so gunicorn does not have to sit there
waiting
hmm
imma test something hold on
what if
you use an async worker
in gunicorn
what is that
it like
switches between requests
idk if I can explain it
because like
im just reading about it rn
send link
hmm
so
you could just
the thing is
I really dont want to implement tcp with ssl
which was the reason for the vpn
which means if ssl is a requirement (which it probably is)
then ws has to be used
also kotlin does not have websockets built in
idk i read that somewhere
heres a question tho
if we were to implement a load balanced jrunner solution
where would the nodes be
anywhere
anywhere is not a place
but it will run in a container
anyone can connect to our server
and provide jrunner5 services
but then
no
that is not
what if someone makes a malicious server
safe
and like
makes it output
illegal content
somehow
yes
so no
it would run on our personal servers
we could add an authentication layer
yes
there would be an authentication layer
like you need a private key to log in
yes
yes
yes
so then anyone we trust
can do it
yes
good
what else
so we would have like
4 nodes
1 running directly on the Vultr
for backup
1 at my house
1 at your house
and 1 somewhere else
akhil maybe
or jp
or something
yeah
also I might run two
one on a pi
actually on our 4h server
yes
also these containers will be running nixos inside
the jrunner containers
because nixos
is really easy to deploy
cant it just be docker
yes
docker
requires an image
so like
also no docker
docker runs as root
but i mean
with this system
you do you
so like
yes
interesting
i wanna use nixos-container
but we shall see
idk what ill do with that yet
i should learn about nixos
it is good
now for the not-so-fun part
bot protection
any ideas?
ah
haproxy
can do the load balancing instead
idk how
but
bot protection
it has rate limiting
nginx also has rate limiting
but like
actually
i think
i just set limits for the users
i think
they can only run 100 times per hour
you can rate limit
people
who security exception
a lot
but what about just like
a dos attack
like
they come and just like
run while true
500 times
that is no longer an issue
but
it is
no they set the timeout to the max
in terms of cpu pinning it is not an issue
15 seconds
is the max
i mean
I think they can override that
but we can fix that
but
uhm
we could like
on jrunner5's side
reject more than one timeout
no that wont work
i wanna stop bots as early on as possible
like for http requests
i can use nginx
to rate limit based on ip
but i think
rate limiting in the managementWS
is where the rate limiting has to be
i mean
for this application
the main issue
is that
the DB
is annoying
since it takes time
limit the number of tests
i can
but
the issue i was having before
was that
each request
good or bad
had to request data
from the database
to verify if it was valid
and that locked it up
why
does it request data from the database
to check if it is valid
to check if the user has exceeded their limit
ah
i think that is fine
if nginx is limiting them
but its not
since its a websocket
you can rate limit web sockets
i mean yes
but like
idk
i have homework
bye
bye
I'm going to think about it more
ok
and I'll share tomorrow
me too
Excuse me what?
lol
I really like this article
how u find the mass of br
Subtract
from
Nuetrons
Pu-239
239 is the total mass
yuh so 100
but it say it wrong
It absorbs a neutron
So the left side has 240
ooooooooooooooooooooooo
And the rightside is 141
yuhhhhhh
much thanks akhil
Cause there is the product plus 2 neutrons
No problemo
I got scared for a sec
Nginx
ooooooooooo
lol no dont go to that in the browser hold on
go to this website:
wss://upstairs-direct.secure1.cy2.me/
as the wss url
Ooo
I got pong’d
send a message
that is not the default
also are you on the right url
lol no
ur not
waut
its being dead
its not gonna work rn
i sent my solubility rules
I mean
It keeps closing
After text is sent
So
no that's cuz
hold on
reconnect
lol its not working
I mean
Its doing a reverse ping pong
lol
Its sending me a ping
And im sending a pong
this is mostly irrelevant
Whats it suppose to do?
its like
supposed to relay messages
but its just to test
a websockets template
and my nginx config
hmm
i do not wanna do this
Yes i have to do that too
what is it
what do we do
we gotta say an exercise
then do said exercise
what mussels are being used
I see
a modification
whats fun
and what we think of it
is i also have to do excercises
for french
so like
i can get 2 birds with one stone
oo
idk its the things with the backpacks
ik what im gonna say for modification
get dumbells
do you have Howard?
no you dont
staats
i had her
i was her tech guy
nice one
ask her about it
seems she still doesnt know how to use tech ig
cause
she will praise me
she
doesnt
put
the damn zoom links
on
the google calendar
she did for my class
well she forgot how ig for us
gud song
idk what it is with me
and all these genres
idk either
should i stick with windows server
or go back to linix
linix
yea ill prob do that
iBuntu
its just a lot nicer ig
i also need to do a hassle
and set up load balanced postgress dbs
i need to set up that thing i was arguing with ramesh about
and implement websockets in Kotlin
i need to set up kubernetes
but i think
i have like
0 use
for kubernetes
i may not have enough ram to do a large setup
atm
i use docker
for services
so kubernetes is great
idk codetools will be on a vultr
yea that works
with 0.5G ram
that should work
i need to run 2 things:
i need to make like 15 vms
gunicorn
ah thats the manegemer kjkjewrjk thing
yes
^ this
lol
each needs like 4 gb ram
i have 32
oh actually a 3rd thing
one node
to do what?
of the distributed jrunner
ah i see
there will be 4-5 nodes
1 on the Vultr
1 at rameshs house
1 at my house
1 at your house
1 at JP's house / server
mine?
i mean sure
if u can make it a docker, i can host like 100 of them
yeah it will be a docker i think
then yea i can scale it to like 50
but like
you can run lots in one docker
yea
thing is like
1 is fine
5 is better
50 is not particularly neccesary
haha
now saying that
i think i need to install nixos now
so i try getting this entire thing up
with a hot standby postgress db
Kid Quill
ah yes
marks all his songs as Explicit
even if they're not
cuz theres like 1 that's not
and he didn't feel like trying to find it
isnt it like if the musician has an explicit tag all the albums and songs will?
no
its per-song
you have heard this song?
think so
i see
wait
my music is luck based
hes already at 621k
that was not the case
before
time to record gym
lol
Biceps, Brachialis & Radial Brachialis (forearm) for refrence
time to do the easiest one, bicep curls
gfdgdfgdgdfgdfgdffgfdgdgdfgdgdfgfdgfdgdfgdfgdgdf
that was the worst 3 minutes of my life
lol
At its core though, “The Story of an Hour” delivers its message through irony.
really
But then I can't use a raspberry pi
and its that number of zeros
i thought that at its core, The Story of an hour delivers its message in about an hour or so
lol
anger
Okay
It's just about as far
And we could do figure out what to do with them later.
Is that how you do it
I see
s/
or is it between forms
I see
I mean
I may try this
I dont use discord
*sigh
its not a very "integrated" IDE
Shot on Galaxy
you must
i discussed with my dad about this
so i am ready to expand with this.
You are Ramesh Balaji
idk next year maybe i get iphone
i see
ima buy apple mac
one in each room
i am not buying another boring x86 laptop
*cough $200 keyboard
and
no
oh cy
find cool cheap hardware
Good night
i never used any pronouns with them
damn
Wha
U wanna buy an apple mac and put one in each room
lol
i was gonna have an internship
Look deeper
i want the pixel ui
thats a whole level of fanboy
and akhil is Akhil
really?
didn't know that
same
but i will say a few other words
like they are the kind of people who upset me
They're meh normal
to make use of them
this may be the hardest step, like I said
remember i am not consistent
a lot
like how loud the area is
and theyre starting
no
Is that how you do it
a google search reveals nothing really
but i fixed it in like 10 minutes
me too
in what project
I have many other things to do
They steal and augment
with 1MB of data
but it obviously was not using the GPU
obviously
In fact, Chopin’s skill permits her to use not only one, but two ironies, to describe Mrs. Mallard’s presently stereo-atypical condition.
Cy
can you make a correllium account
no it requires a credit card
you have
one
right
and also i have 🅾 time
yes
i do
and its a debit
idk
card
so that means
oh
if all the money leaves
it does not
come back
ever.
yes
but i just wanted a free trial
ill cancel my account after
yes but if it has my credit card
and it charges it incorrectly
i cant call BofA and tell them
thats why
to remove the charge
you use

hi ramesh
hey
bye
bye
I have time but not a lot
i have to so 20 mins of French yoga.
god save the queen
im already dead
god save the queen indeed
that sounds awful
lol the "GPU Process was using all my cpu"
so killed it
then
you dont wanna know
what happened
a massive flipgrid record button
just
slowly
enlarged
and uncovered
before me
in google docs
…
yes gpu mem corruption is fun
hacker news is bad
like the articles are sometimes good
but the comments are meh
they are elistist mac users after all; whatever should I expect
lol
you look like you are 40 and 8 at the same time
lol
that is now
done
and contrary to akhil's response
it was not that bad
my eyes hurt now
time to listen to a good song
um
do you want one
it's in japanese though
lol this one is too
ooh
let me send you mine then
U sent this before right?
yes
Wait
amazarashi
i love this album
Ramesh uses Spotify?
no
*gasp
I have an account
so I can add
things
to this
and hackathon playlists
i should add to that
i need to add from all the generes
soundtrack
50s
indie pop
swing
j-funk
bill wurtz
cuz hes a genre
lol
yes
also jpop
jpop is good
kpop is bad
north korean music is good
lol
cpop is probably good
2000s pop is good
what is c
2010/2020 music is all junk
Chinese?
yes
except coldplay
i like it
80s/90s music is good
video game music is good.
Rock is good
no hate it
Jazz is good
duran duran
what's that one song
Take five?
Its not bad
anyhow
i like jpop the most
Well the opening sounds decent
Thats how i determine what i listen to
found some French yoga
the problem with training videos on youtube is that they are sexualized
so I don't like it
Wha..
lol
Why?
it's
true
instead of having zoom
and listening to music
and discussing
we are having to do this
people are wearing less clothes when they exercise
oftentimes those clothes are tight fitting and revealing
hence
sexualized.
ok ramesh
lets stop now
im just
providing an observation
la clase de français
idk how to say class
classe
probably clase but cours
Sounds right
classe
ah
k
i like the word tel
it means such
a-t-il
il y a des personnes vertes.
there are
green people
what
tel personnes ne sonts pas bleu.
such people are not blue
idk if bleu is blue
yes
it is
why
how does this make sense
is it tel or te
le quotidien
like pronounced
do you say tel
or te
tel
les devoirs quotidien
tell person ay ne sõ pah bleoo
b-leo
the homework
work
something
remaining?
idk
no
the daily homework
ah
akhil doesnt bother with the link
just album art now
lol
he doesn't want you to listen to it
i like lollypop
hi akhil
lets chat
Its easier to sc
wait
where did the
cy has no time thing go
wait
i must have scrolled
lol
no i do have no time
u distract me
im eating dinner
so i can chat
quick
distract him
lol
i like this ui
this reminds me of some other time
i dont
please allow me to complete my French yoga
looks fine
no
good or fine
is this my shadow if i say file
since thats one letter away from fille
im wait
is that english
freudian slip
no it's french
i cant understand things
im going insane
o hyh nur
its easy
learn french
nur means fille in chinese
it's not spelled like that tho
oh thats cool
do you have premium
nope
also have you considered trying linux
desktop linux
see i would
but i dont wanna install linux on my mac
cause honestly macos is fine
but linux is better
idk
i feel like linux is better
lol what else is new
it is in some aspects
should i install arch or nix on my server
i kinda wanna go back to linix
but hyper v has such a nice admin center thing
idk
nix has a STEEP learning curve
see
i think you should learn how linux works first
do you know what systemd is
those r the service things right
yes
but what is it
like you can define this in two words
systemctl?
um
background stuff
no
it is
an init system
do you know what an init system is
this is an integral component of a unix system
its PID 1 right?
pretty sure i read about it somewhere
yes
what does it do
its the first thing to actually run
yes
it does things
it starts up backround services
and then
it also mounts disks
and everything like branches off of it
sets up the network
etc
k
what is the fstab file
that has all ur UUIDs for stuff
no
what does it
do
mounting?
for disks
correct
it mounts things at startup
no clue
um
config
like optional stuff, idk i just stuff random stuff in here
uh
um
usr data?
um log files and stuff
yes
what is
oh idk
haha
i mean
time to make arch vms
this is gonna be absolute cancer
to set up
Why
describe
every
no
i gotta do the entire thing
can you understand
for 10 vms
the commands
to install arch
at the basis i think so
good
also script it
use terraform
terraforms for cloud i think
but ill try that and ansible
they both look really good
chef > ansible
since ruby > python
but idk if you know ruby
nope
yea i found, Terraforms for cloud provisioning, Ansible is for bare metal
but terraform has support for vmware and openstack
is openstack good?
i see it pretty often
it is
impossible to set up
openshift may be good
i gtg
bye
yea but that costs money
hi I'm in the basement talking to myself
good job
for AP seminar
Cy is becoming mad
What a weird way th describe practicing for a presentation
That is like saying hi I am staring at random people who I have no connection to through an anonymous computer screen - zoom classes
i mean
why would u practice for presentations in virtual especially
i will try installing okd later
but since thats like kubernetes
i may switch to nix first then libvirt like fedora vms
cuz its 10% of my entire AP score
Wait
For ap seminar do u have to take an ap exam?
yes
Huh
but its not your whole AP score
like with most classes
your AP score is also based on 2 Performance Tasks
PT1 and PT2
this is the PT1 TMP
Team Multimedia Presentation
Huh
One could call it
My catchphrase
google has a mono space font
called
space mono
mono space
space mono
Yes
I use jetbrains mono
It has no real significant differences
It just has cool ligatures
DM Mono is good
What defines a monospace  font
fixed width
That looks nice
it does
its very defined
IBM plex mono is also nice
i suppose
i like DM Mono
Yea it looks nice
Scientifica tho
Find it on GitHub
I want u to see it before i say anything
this?
Yup
idk
This looks cool on picture
But using it
lol
Is god awful
What font?
DM Sans
the not monospace version
of DM
Wait DM looks kinda nice
yeah
Imma install it
Google fonts?
yes
Alrighty
the f is fun
Holy cow wait
That looks really clean
Yes
Check out cornerstone
Its not really a useable font
wdym
oh
Its more for like websites and stuff
yeah
I still like jetbrains mono
Does DM mono have fancy ligatures?
wdym
what are ligatures
I dont u r using any
Go to jetbrains monos website
what are ligatures
Thats the best way to show them
Its essentially turning stuff like ~~> into cleaner lines
== into a == without a space
==> into an actual arrow
ah
i see
Yea they nice to have
no DM doesn't have those
i like that idea
i might use Jetbrains Mono
Its a pretty commonly used font i think
Looks really similar to vscode default
vscode default is different on different platforms
the ligatures dont work
im switching back to DM
for now
Think u gotta enable em somehow
ok so the animation when you click the search button
is one to copy
that is a nice
animation

Dr. P: "Charging down the page..."
I’m doing the exact same thing lmao
Someone give me a COVID vaccine discord notifier
or imma make one
thats my next project
hi i am DONE with PT1
this is
wonderful
PT1 needed to end
and it finally did
wait
mq02 is dead
and my humidifier doesn't work anymore
mqtt
died
i havent been renewing my letsencrypt
should I buy a chinese plug
smh
that happens automagically right
it does for me
with caddy
its supposed to
but like
i broke it
theres no certbot
it just has my cloudflare key
and when https stops working
it renews
lol
certbot webroot is nice
it does not take down your server
how about
caddy
and does not require
giving your cloudflare key
i think caddy does not take down your server
idk
ramesh do you wanna call
and discuss distributed jrunner5
yes
in a few minutes
ok
also
im listening to a song
and it needs to finish
what is this
why is it faster
over
wifi
lol
wait yeah
wtf
lol
use wifi then
no
im stuck on wifi
um
idk
nvm
im so confused
oh
i made the wrong server and client
do you wanna call
few minutes
maybe 2 to 3
then I can
ok
k
send call link
I have to eat lunch
so I shall be leaving now
um
ramesh finally gives a reason
when do you come back
comp cy club
you eat at your desk tho
i
not always
ok
hi my name is chrome
im really fast
and
i do this to your memory
woba woba woba woba
9 GB in less than 5 seconds
i figured it out
i can barely type
this is a you problem
um
then we will have to meet
to discuss it
because i have no clue
what the issue is
nvm
want to call now
or
ok
idk
if I feel like it rn
im figuring out the issue
because if I do it now then it will be too much
k lmk when ur done
i almost have it working
good
i kinda wanna rewrite emotes in rails
ok
because I hate flask
lol
ok i got it working
wanna call?
ill call at 2:30
that's komp sci tho
yes
we can call then
but I think we can do it without calling
you know that nothing happens during comp sci
and that we have to use Discord
i think things do happen during comp sci
and discord is fine
discord is awful
if you want to make things happen
it works fine for me
idk why
no the quality
its 720p
and the latency
is like im using Iridium as my ISP
iridium
what is that
A global satellite internet provider
that is NOT Starlink
and is exceptionally slow
but
has a global network
that is fully deployed
and accessible everywhere
except north korea
can I access it
yes
how
you need a reciever
and you need to pay
how much is it
is it monthly pay
a lot
in fact
it may only be for commercial use
how much is starlink
$100
per month
i think
that's too much
well no data cap
still bad
and 150 mbps
so
why cant you call
so we can discuss
you can text
but you cannot call
yes
my parents like talking to me every few minutes
what is the
path
im using /
it does not matter
also
i did not change anything on the python side
you have to like
add the Sec-WebSocket-Extensions header
and
enable deflation compression
because the server wants that
i could tell the server to not want that
but
call
please
no
idc if ur parents are talking
you can pause
talk to them
then resume
no
*sigh
i just
dont feel like doing that rn
ok
You can do it at 2:30
or via text
ok
imma try some other things bye
why is there a taylor swift song that decides to randomly stop outputting audio for a specific period of time
lol
ah
it crashes
mpv
this is a strange song
ah
maybe smloadr broke
lol i cant just "forget about async generators"
programming my server
i need to know how async generators work
bye
you should learn nix
bye
that is not an async generator
but
no i will now create an async generator
no one tells me what i cant do.
oh
i think ik why this happens
i was born
and then my future was cancelled
this seems easy
i see
im sure you would rather have had it in a protobuf tho
no
i wouldnt
k we can implement this
next
i almost got the async generator working
this website is outdated so
access denied
i dont understand how generators end
why yes, it did
and who the f are you to say it cant?
me when i try to stop a thread in java
wait
its because
StopIteration
used to end the for loop
but now
it just raises StopIteration
so
i must use a try/except
got it
so you gotta set the referer
it is beyond me
why they changed this
but ok
so that's why
my websockets code
a try/except loop
to signal when a client disconnects
but how to get the store numbers
i now know how AsyncIO works
mostly
I now know how the cvs api works
lol
just use Bing
lol
LOL this is so easy
I did it
i got bind9 to work
hi ramesh
come to the room
no
we are doing club management
wait there is komp cy
lol "i can meet at 2:30"
"stuff gets done during comp sci"
lol you were just stuck on this screen
akhil where are you
what room should i go to
2
ill come
ramesh
i think
it is impossible
for me to get client ips
wait
hold up
no
it works
it does
work
hi ramesh
i saw some random websockets requests to my server
from amazon
hey look another one just came in
Jeff bezos wants part of CodeTools
lol
\
my life for the next 2 hrs
jsdhgsdgsdhgsdklj;sdghjsdg
lol
where is ramesh
he is like
sending me
reqests
am I
I do not think I am
then who is
idk
get the IP
I'm eating dinner ttyl
?
or this
?
This is not balanced
lol ur right
4O2 on the left
?
SO_2 is a polyatomic
Its one entity
One thing
um
This looks more correct
oh wait
no
so
that
was for
But idk the equations and stuff so
this
Ah i see
lol i was like why isnt my worker working
and then i realized
is a thing
gee, thanks
what was the questionm?
um
i think ur mass is off
um
ok
it should be 102
no its not
also u do a weird order for them
our teacher said to do ^101_37Rb if that is the correct one
top number first
um
it def should be 102
why
239 + 1 —> 136 + 2 + 102
oh right
theres that one extra
yup
i did that order here tho
idk urs is weird
um
right I need to set up a wiki
that will happen
nohost is functining
*sigh
word is bork
i cant read my chem notes
i should not have switched to the preview channel
actually on second thought
dark mode is really good
idk
tf is this
i dont get it
cy, cy, cy
smh
stop swearing.
then ull get it
i did not swear until like
akhil came
and gave me the right answer
and it was still wrong
Smh cy blaming it on others
smh ramesh smh at cy
you tell me what the answer is
i need to use the RSA sign/verify api
i will now figure this out
im still debiating if I should rewrite emotes in rails
it'll be more maintainable
*sigh
mr y emails me
because a student cannot access his video
at this link
welcome to tech supoprt!
oh
nvm
and its like
Mr Y...
the software specifically says
MIT?
idk
its some license
its like
wdym
apparently i have limited connectivity
but i dont
apparently rsa is more complicated than i thought
try pgp
but idk how to sign things in pgp
all i need
is to sign
and verify signature
well i need a signed key
hold on
lemme keep
experimenting
ok so this is what i have to do
i have to take the id of the content
then
use my private key to make a signature
then store that in the db
so then
when the client wants to run
it fetches the signature
and then passes both the contentID and the signature to managementWS
then managementWS uses the public key to verify the signature
given the contentID
this way
with no reads to the DB
i can verify the authenticity of the request
this is fast
it is
much faster than querying a DB
now of course the only issue is
it will
destroy everything
and they will have to regenerate everything
so ill put it in a folder
and then you run it in that folder
then take the file and put it in the root
or alternatively
i could just add
a check
to see
if the file is already there
wait im dumb
i can just sign them in real time
*sigh
you can now
go to
open the console
go to the test editor
and then
see in the console
in the object
there is now an "id_sig"
that took
longer
than it should have
I see
im like
dealing with servers rn
ok
get jrunner done at some point tho
i have to implement the frontend
sure
it is like
almost done
i have to add two things
so ill do it after I finish setting up the edge kettl
what is the edge kettl
beta test website
ok
someone tell me why my workers are not working
ok so my worker is working ok
but then
my other worker
is not working
its being lazy
*sigh
asyncio
also web sockets with bytes
dont have a terminate
which is Stupid.
ugh
i have to learn about kotlin coroutines
see most websocket implementations use strings
and JSONs
i see
i have to learn about
asyncio
which is being a pain in the tukkus
he obviously knows how to use asyncio
async
is
coroutines
yes
so ig we both get to suffer
now you see
my issue is this
i have a "coroutine" or whatever
and it has
and the problem
is that like
the coroutine only responds once every like
18 seconds
also
I haven't started learning about them
this is unrelated
so I will like
not understand what you are saying
im listening to MAX remix The Greatest Showman
I'm listening to Bakemono by amazarashi
its not a bad remix
but he is certainly not a soundtrack artist
im mad that the tutorial is using macos
oh please
can people stop using this junk os
no
they will
continue
to use it
ok im not having this argument
until someone else shapes up
and makes a relevant competitor
that is known as linux
and windows
no
^
k bye
bye
go learn how coroutines work
i mean i know how they work
but like
i need to figure out why
one coroutine is like
locking up my other coroutine
right
the server is in development
so um
one moment
^^ run this
its some crap
but it works
uhm
i want
to not do this
wait
ok so this is a websocket server
ok
yes
does it not say have any output
whatever
it has output
when things happen
when y ou first start it
no not when it starts
it runs on port 5000
when you connect things happen
it will broadcast incoming messages to all clients
except the one that sent the message
now how do I make it do things
oh and apparently
it prints like
the headers
wdym
like
code
sending
if you wanna send messages to your kotlin
open another client
and send the messages from there
and if you wanna recieve them
go to that client
and see them
k we will deal with this later
im adding ws vs wss support
that's not the actual server i have
just to be clear
that is just some crap that works
and is pretty straightforward to understand
so you can modify it
for testing things
uhm
is it normal for chromium to make my gpu go like
beserk
and like have insane graphical glitches everywhere
um
idk if you heard i mentioned it earlier
but theres like
some issue
yeah
i just had it
with the latest chromium release
i have attributed my issue to the time.sleep() command
the thing is
im not dumb
i did not run time.sleep()
in a coroutine
i ran it in a thread in a thread pool
No blocking code in my thread pool = asyncio queue worker actually works
this is absurd
as usual
polling
works
i can poll the queue
and there is no issue
but who wants to poll a queue
i guess its worth it to poll it every 1 second
instead of waiting 18 seconds for it to decide to work
wait
im dumb
*2
and it has a built-in method for awaiting execution in a thread pool
without blocking the asyncio event loop thread
*smh
time to rewrite everything
alright ok fine
it like
works
but
if i request once
it "blocks" the coroutine for the client
so if it requests again
it hangs
until the last request completes
that's it im going to bed
my brain is not present enough atm to deal with asyncio
I am
Done with jrunner5
But like i havent tested it yet
hi cy
jrunner5 now works with websockets
you just have to implement it on your end
yes
hi im google chrome
i use
eleven gigabytes
of memory
Um what
Hey, chrome, my name is windows explorer
i do this
to your cpu
whenever i feel like it
*cough
56GB ram+swap
*cough
how much do you have running
i apparently have like
130 chrome tabs
a lot of tabs
around that much
on each window
i see
im surprised im only using a gig swap
nice
mine is relatively clean atm
I shut down my computer every night
so this never happens
mine became messy and will prob be for the next week or so
i shut down my computer only when it forces me
i just
close my laptop
someone please help this computer
um what
last time it was jrunner5
this time
its windows explorer
yay *cygh
damn
it is a protobuf-loving company
oh
i thought it was crhome
krome
krome like memory
what Microsoft understood
was that
ppl
dont use desktops
with 32gb ram
I do
and they made edge
lighter
and less ram intensive
wtf
is using 18gb of ram
lol
ah i decided leaving the windows vm on was a good idea
hi my name is
USB 3.2 Gen 1
i bet you know how fast i am
lol jk you have no clue
you know
jrunner5 is interesting
i do
4gbps
the code looks better now
i see
because
i have asyncio issues
kotlin has when statements
I had none when testing
but I wasn't trying to do much
no cuz this
right
so
i have an asyncio loop
which is running the websockets
but
i wanna send
to the websockets
from a thread pool
ah that
you send to the websocket
as a separate thing
like a different url
no the thing is
to make it do stuff
i cant call ws.send()
from the thread pool
u dont
u call it from another function
wdym
like
thread pool calls a function which is in a class with the web socket clients
and then that function calls ws.send
no the thread pool has access to ws
and ws.send
but
it does nothing
wdym it does nothing
cuz it needs to be awaited
ah
then uhm
await it
you cant do that
in a regular function
block then
the thing is this
i tried like
several
different ways
to call ws.send()
from the thread pool
this file works
run until complete
does it
send
yes
a websocket
yes
message
from a thread pool
not a threadpool
but i mean
it shouldn't make a difference should it
lol
except
it does
you could ask in the python discord
lol
i looked up this online
and they said this
they said
in order to do this
you must
create an asyncio worker
that reads from a queue
and then
push to the queue
from the thread pool
which works
except
it takes
18 seconds
like
it will respond
every 18 seconds
dont use a thread pool then
just use async for everything
but i cant use that
which will be slower right
for db calls
they dont support asyncio
you can call blocking stuff
in async methods
yes
but then
you block the coroutine
well
no
so if you run a blocking command directly
you block the entire loop
and your websocket server dies
if you use the built-in thread pool execution system
you can await a blocking call
by sending it into a thread pool
and then awaiting a result
but
then you block the coroutine
that said
i think
this is a limitation
of the websocket library im using
all ws calls
must be done
from within the asyncio event loop
this is like
or they wont work
but then
what about my queue worker
you have to offload the database stuff to the thread pool while
stuff is happening
well no so what i can do is like
this:
but that blocks the coroutine
cuz theres await
but i think
that will have to do
im not too sure how async works
but I will learn
i have to learn it for rust as well
no i can tell you
no
theres a loop
i dont want you to
theres a good diagram
lemme find it
I
don't
want
it
lol here it is anyway
the thing is
the client should not be having to send another request
while one is pending
and so
i think this works
to block their coroutine
for 0.05 seconds
while a db call is executed
i just would have preferred something else
but as long as it can handle a few hundred people
i am satisfied
so apple tv isn't just on apple OSes?
I'm shocked
?
apple tv
has
not apple os
apps
Yea the app
Apple tv is its own thing
I need to cycle my IP address since CVS sucks
Ip?
public ip
screw CVS
Ah wait im stupid
I was gonna say
their idiotic thing banned me
since curl
Just cycle MAC address
But thats for like complementary wifi
Really?
Just a curl got u banned
Yes
Thats very stupid
yes
i didnt even spam them
i literally just
Btw this is a good trick for like airport wifi
Curl
curl
yes
once
and they ban me
Curl doesnt even do anything
Welp
hi you can spam from a browser
what
yes
yes
but
apparently cvs is dumb
so they don't do that
what is this tho
with the Apple oss
Apple tv is garbage to be fair
no i dont get
what it is saying
what is that a list of
Its a list of supported platforms
For the app
for what app
Apple tv
Its an app and a like physical box if u didnt know
Technically apple tries to link all ur accounts to it
Which is so cancer
but i dont get
what is significant
about
that chart
apple is walled garden
they would never
oh
the fact that
it is available
on other platforms
On other stuff
Yea
i see
But apple music is also
yes
i have apple music for android
and i have to eat dinner
bye
Adios
Also btw this is cool
I like this
remember my
watch face?
No
the dots one
I dont remember at all
I dont think I’ve even seen it
I remember
It
my story might be
no
thats a spoiler
i deleted things
these are really misogynistic
but ok
look at the responses
it like
said something
cohesive
yes
it apologized
so
how
how the heck
it is leaving
because of what it mentioned
these or not women; opinion is masculine
Okay I will leave now bc of what I mentioned
*mentioned above
fbi open up time
in my story
make that your webcam
image
wdym webcam image
no your pfp
for school
no i made it my flipgrid selfie
should i make it my school pfp
yes
you should
…
why
bc
free attention
make this your pfp
no dont
no i want the green one
yes
but im writing rn
so no
you know what i wanna make my pfp
this picture of me
when i was 10
no
make it like
the one i took of you
wearing sunglasses
in 7th grade
with my hair
all spikey
i dont know where the digital copy of it is
i have it in a frame on a shelf
no ur making it this
lol
mug shot
yes
that is better
lol
its not terrible
like appearance wise
not expression wise
my hair is not all messed up
thing is like
for my personal account
it cant be identifiable
and for my school account
it cant be like
so bad
that like
cuz like
professional interactions
...
i think this is fine
make that your pfp
for school
lol
do it
i like my circle
or do it in telegram
right
i have a telegram pfp
forgot
do it
i never see it
this is boring
do it
no
*cygh
fine
i like my static pfps
that have
do you see mine
no emotion
and are not funny
what do you think
i like it
torvalds
haha
"especially not your distribution"
"i tried to install it 5 years ago"
"and it was hard"
"so i didn't use it"
"and i never will again"
have you watched scrapyard wars
no
actually
maybe
aw WebP does not work
cy
why
im going back to writing
bye
hi cy
wanna read my story
no I am currently watching "A Raisin in the Sun"
it has 2 hours left
have fun
bye
Hey cy read my unrealistic story that copies yours slightly
lol replit now has BASIC
10 GOTO 10
yes
im going to learn react
after I do some homework
what did I say
I knew it
i think react is the best option
because
vue
1. websites
elm
yew
yawn
2. react native
bye
3. ionic
nah
flutter does that
im not using flutter
it does not meet
my standards
id earlier use cordova
or just not make apps
cuz apple is dum
and i dont have $100
to spend
each year
for the privilege
of being rejected
by apple
ill do that when i have to
i tried flutter
react native
and Xamarin forms
and
react native
was actually like
native
flutter was some failed attempt to reproduce
the appearance of nativeness
and Xamarin forms
was all flickery
and the animations were made by microsoft
Microsoft does not know how animations work
they are supposed to improve the feel of the ui
not destroy it
I like flutter
ergo I will use it
ergo?
therefore
i see
ok
we will be making the 4h app
most likely in react
I hate js
With a passion
lol me too
not as much with a passion
so i wont use it
and we must support
standards
so that vendor lockin
gets
locked out
says this
while I write js
what is this apps script
my spanish teacher gave us like 37 words
and we have to make slides for them
so I just
made a script to make the slides so I can just focus on populating them
i see
just make a
website
cant
she wants slides
also what prevents you from like
ctrl c
i have to copy the words
ctrl v *37
which takes a while
ah
like into the titles
ok
have fun
so it's worth the time it took to make the script
i have to make my tile
for my tessellation
lol
…
bye
then i have to read the AP sem stimulus materials
then i have to learn react
what if i rewrite codetools in react
hey cy
did you read my story
no
not yet
it is
wheres ur soap story
i want to make sure it's not too copycat
i can read it
at some point
yeah
when i have time
so like
when i retire
see you in 70 years
k bye
bye
wao
extra beyutiful
👏
tezelashin
im dying
give me some bad habits of people
playing with knives
as fidget toys
um
i mean common ones
that you see often
i see it every day
ah
i am concerned now
being edgy
bad habits
um
being simps to girls
thats
definitely a bad habit
making your variables named
a
b
c
a1
b2
c_3
i cant write that in a spanish thing can i now
mabye i should have clarified
health related bad habits
lol
U know what sure
health related
um
ill add that
you can
you can say
"Mis amgios siempre hace todo para las chicas que quieren"
cyfinfaza: "My friends always do everything for the girls they want"
want = like in spanish in this context
quieren
that's like
courir
to run
the girls you
run after
fait
faitent
cdknight: faitent
how do you conjugate
lol
ils faitent
they do
cdknight: they do
cyfinfaza: they do
they do
cdknight: ils font
Mes amis toujours font tout pour les filles que ils veut
cdknight: My friends always do anything for the girls they want
mes amis font toujours tout pour les filles qu'ils aiment
yes
i should learn
contractions are a thing
tel personnes
tel
i forgot tel
whatever
im doing my spanish homework
bye
bonjour
je mappelle cy
same
cependent que tu n'est pas finit, tu ne vas pas me parler
cyfinfaza: however you are not finished, you are not going to talk to me
lol
i mixed up
however
and while
well i can do multitasking
i can chat on one monitor
flex
and do spanish on the other
u also have two
im making my tessellation scalable
literally and figuratively
it wont
center
a;sdlkfja;sldkfj
um
that looks like the center
lol
um
not to me
wait ik why
i have to make the width a multiple of 4
we are getting somewhere
that hurts
my eyes
lol
you know what hurts more
watching it violently flicker
for 3 minutes
use intellij
that solves that problem
im done now
it goes though its whole routine
and the "animation"
actually involves scaling the tiles
since my code is scalable
this is no problem
pun both intended and not intended
lol
my tessellation broke the repl
meh it worked for run #1 so
its fine
hi my name is cy
wtf is this
someone please
help me
is this
not english
this is AP Semminarre
in that case
I have 0 clues
its like
some plan
for a scored discussion
that we are doing tomorrow
well
starting tomorrow
email Y
Mister Why
imma spend some more time trying to decipher it
that is laggy
now they're chanting "we love you" like a bunch of morons
lets not get too political
lol did i actually just ask that of us
i am reading my AP Semminarre Stimulis Matireals
is working on the tessellation project
Yup
my animation scales the tiles
Lol
they get bigger and smaller
cuz i have to flex
the scalability
of my code
I'm doing the animation rn
thats cool lookin
react
is interesting
it wants me to install a JSX preprocessor
and use node.js
for everything
see im the do it yourself type
so with react
i can just design my own fancy ui components
that dont discriminate against android
and be able to reuse them
hey cy
upvote
and then package them with cordova
idk my login
also that's not true
it's humor
i suppose
but like
also
who is u/icanaffordthewire
me
i see
im  a mod
on r/ridge_high
lol
i need to learn more about react
bye
bye
i like the instructions on the Gatsby website on how to install node
the install for mac is like
1.5 pages long
the install for linux is like
3 pages long
and the install for windows
Um what?
Its one line
Brew install gatsby-cli
Yea thats if ur stupid
If ur using gatsby/react u prob have all that stuff downloaded
i do
Yea i also did
Node is one of those things u need
i think imma start doing some stuff with gatsby
cuz like
it doesn't require me to use node.js as my server
Have fun
although i should probably learn that too
you tried it
what did you think
Its nice
i see
ok
hi akhil
you know how Gatsby works
why isnt my styling working
hi i figured it out
gatsby-browser.js was not in the right directory
oops
oh
my
god
collapsing margins
why
why
why
why
no
stop it
stop
no
a;sdlkfj;aslkdfj
sometimes i really like the W3C
sometimes
they need to gtfo
and stop breaking things
who on earth
thought it would be a good idea
for the margins of children
to result
in their parents being moved down
and their margins
exceeding the borders of the parent
and messing up all the styling
like if they at least gave a way to disable it
which they dont
lol
404 - could not find the 404 page
someone tell me why
random cmd windows keep appearing
randomly
for like 120ms
hi
cause u didnt put a 404 page
under src/pages
when have u had this domain?
ok so you know Surge right
it is literally the best thing
how to deploy a Gatsby site with surge:
i now need to learn about CMS
quick
what do i put
um
not rust
rust makes me feel
insecure
so does my password
i need something that makes me secure
FaceID
haha
something else
Contentful CMS
actually that works
wait akhil you used surge right
when you did the tutorial
for gatsby
*cough
i did the tutorial
but i kinda cut it short around data
to try stuff
no it was like the end of step 2
surge is for deployment
no i did like the introduction stuff
like the very beginning beginning
akhil
go to your gatsby project
and install surge
from npm
then run this
yea ik but i dont need that right now
no try it
its like
ill do it at a later date
really nice
my problem with gatsby is that it is strictly jamstack
Hey cy
you should look into JWTs
they are really cool
it's a signed token basically
I see
i could do that
but
i am looking at Contentful CMS rn
I wrote my own CMS
i will be making a jamstack app
kinda
see i could do everything myself
but
i am embarking
on a project
where my goal
is to write
I am
as few lines
of code
of my own
as possible
in rails
and I'm like
done with the authentication part already
you think you can make a website in 2 hours in rails
i think
i could make
a website
with jamstack
in 20 mins
if i get good at it
I
am rusty with rails
if I actually remembered I would like
be done by now
the thing is
with the entire thing
with jamstack
you are production ready
very quickly
which is why i really like the prospect
if someone has an idea for a website
i can make it
with extreme speed
and have it to them
very quickly
Yeah
but such speed only comes with proficiency
I can do the same with rails
and since I detest js
I will write rails
how do you deploy rails
wdym
you use bundler
what are the steps
and call like
i havent done it before
you have to like just do like
bundle install production probably
no
idk
cuz like
jamstack
you set an environment variable
soemthing something
its as fast as like
one command
and the website is online
public
and production ready
obviously if you want more control you use like
netlify
see
rails is backend
see jamstack
also you can use heroku with rails
has very little backend
so I can just do
git push heroku master
and then
it deploys
but scalability?
hmm
see i am trying
to figure out
what the superior form of web dev is
or at least
There is none
what the advantages/disadvantages are
I think each form of web dev has certain prospects to it
Yea this
like if i am making codetools
probably not jamstack
but
rails is my favourite
the thing is
have you experimented with jamstack
what is jamstack
lol
lol
its highly js based
and it goes against like
70% of your ideals
what
is it composed of
Javascript
API
Markup
ok
nvm
the reason was like
this guy on youtube
made a
"production ready real-time chat app"
with sign in
in "8 minutes"
more like
20-30
but like
with jamstack
and he wrote 0 backend code
idk
i just
i cant js
i see
idk imma give it a try
idk what for tho
i might try and redo codetools in it
even tho like
that's not particularly productive
i wanna figure out how to integrate react into codetools
without making it slow
also ramesh
it's a static site generator
like gatsby
and like
hugo and whatnot
The only difference is I wrote the static site generator
i see
You can literally see if you want
I'm going to add asciidoc support to it
is there like
a readme
no
i
should add one
Like I agree but im lazy
i see
im getting tired of my junk markup language
so i wanna use asciidoc
no code required for validation
just this
IntelliJ
Yes
It does fancy stuff
Gatsby is starting to get mildly illogical
the style property in JSX
has to be
a
dictionary
which means
i cannot just
paste it
into a css file
and have it auto format
vs python
it went off the screen
granted this one is like
more logic in the python one
which I'll add to rails later
since I can actually do that
because its ORM
is actually not a hot mess
i see
im already on to the final part
uploading emotes
i am trying to understand react
and gatsby
I wanna standing table
same
i wanna make one
that seems fun
k
rails emotes works
I just gotta add like a few minor things and it will be done
so all these ppl are like
making blog examples with Gatsby
but
they never start from scratch
and they never like
show how to add new content
after publishing
dont u like use the graphql thing to do it
well heres my issue
i believe you have to rebuild the entire site
every time you want a new path
no
like for a new post
um
no
wait mabye
so im a little conflicted
it may be
but thats not the worst thing to happen
like u make a post and then have something server side detect it and rebuild
i see
tbh i think im suffering from a lack of a goal
atm
so maybe i should get a goal
yea thats why i just left Gatsby for the moment
ill pick it up later
but i have other things to learn/do
I wanna rewrite the editor frontend for CodeTools in react
so theres a goal
lemme go do that
*copy and paste
copy it into react then create components for the things that get used more than twice
yeah essentially
but then
add states
and hooks
and stuff
to make things nice
and animation
i recommend React-Spring
its a physics based animation library thing
idk im mostly dealing with Microsoft monaco
which will not be animated
imma look at more tutorials
bye
have fun
this is the most beautiful thing i have seen
RStudio is so nice
i dont know why i didnt use it before
aka this morning
rails emotes is done
hi i am not using gatsby
for CodeTools
i will use create-react-app
Have fun
i now have made a conclusion
Gatsby is for static sites that need good SEO
so it build everything
and makes it accessible with no js
but
create-react-app
lets me define a file
and place my react components
in one html element
which means
it is trivial to implement
especially for my application
that's also why you have to rebuild each time
when you make a new blog post
because
you need to generate that HTML
for the SEO
and load times
I mean im not gonna be using it for a blog so
Its fine for me
what are you gonna use it for
Landing page
yeah that's good
use Gatsby
whats funny
is that like
i wrote essentially my own react
for CodeTools
but actual react is much better
see part of it is react
part of it is not
Yea i figured
Huh
you dont understand
this is
cuz it means it works right with flask
and my jinja templates
and all that
and it means they do deliver on their promise
hi my name is cy
and i keep forgetting
what calls functions
and what references them
this guy is very helpful
he knows that ppl are idits
his tutorials are good
this is, by far, the best website you have ever encountered.
if this looked way better
you would not think
it was written
in fifty-eight lines of code
because it's not
microsoft monaco is a lot of lines of code
no
like
i mean
the rest of it
ah I can imagine though
writing this
in regular js
in like
10 lines of code
could you?
lemme see
use onclick
write two functions
and then replace the monaco text if they click on either
have two variables for the text
it has to save
reload the page
it still is there
you mean
localstorage
yes
you can do that in like 1 line
and load it in
oh also
that 58 lines
is like
also the html
oh
um
cuz jsx
actually its more like 60 lines since i made a custom component for the buttons
which was
completely unneccesary
var dec 1 = from local storage else default
var dec 2 = from local storage else default

on click 1 { set monaco 1 }
on click 2 { set monaco 2 }

<button onclick = on click 1, onload = on click 1>thing</button>
<button onclick = on click 2, onload = on click 2>thing 2</button>

<script include monaco>

<monaco />
there
the buttons have to change color
also what is that
language
add that to the click
its
psuedocode
ok this is
58 lines
of
actual
code
i doubt i need that much
but whatever
try it
nah
also
what
nvm
it's just like
i keep trivializing your code
by saying it's bad
you didn't say it was bad
you just like
in some way
like
i imply
did what ppl do
this
when like
i do the same thing
yeah ik
im trying to not be like that
i find it problematic
i see
react is good
i like react
it is
logical
and i like
logic
im just like
I really wish
some frontend language had
serde
what
serde
the web is very string based
do you know what serde is
SerDe
it takes json
and turns it into a struct
with associated methods
etc
why do you need to transfer methods over the web
I don't
but it's like easier to render a class
like I could in rust
write a trait called ToJSON
*sigh
rust
no
ToHTML
and then
I can just
call to html on my classes
and it can render the entire thing
rust is a systems engineering language
can I take a json
and just
call to_html on it
in js
actually I probably could
hmm
what would that do
maybe I should write a
frontend thing that does this
no i dont get
except like not in js
what like
you want it to do
in like python wasm
ok so
let's say
python wasm
what
is a thing
anyway
let's say
i have a json.
ok.
{ 'name': "Cy", 'picture': "10yearoldcy.png", "description: "Cy sees."}
okay
Now.
Yes.
Let's say I have like.
A lot of these
10 of these
And I want a list of them
ok
wdym
I am viewing a bunch of profiles after searching.
a list
wait
[{ 'name': "Cy", 'picture': "10yearoldcy.png", "description: "Cy sees."}, { 'name': "Ramesh", 'picture': "ramesh.png", "description: "Ramesh is blind."}, { 'name': "Akhil", 'picture': "movingakhil.gif", "description: "Akhil. Should. Go. Read."}]
Okay
so now
I get this from the REST API.
ok
Now what I want is basically:
<div class="user">
    <h3>{{ name }}</h3>
   <p>{{ description }}</p>
   <img src="{{ picture }}" />
</div>
Three times.
ok so
lemme tell you how
there are 2 options
<div>
<div class="user">
    <h3>{{ name }}</h3>
   <p>{{ description }}</p>
   <img src="{{ picture }}" />
</div>
<div class="user">
    <h3>{{ name }}</h3>
   <p>{{ description }}</p>
   <img src="{{ picture }}" />
</div>
<div class="user">
    <h3>{{ name }}</h3>
   <p>{{ description }}</p>
   <img src="{{ picture }}" />
</div>
</div>
I don't want to use React
well then theres one option
Or any framework
And I hate fetch
no there is no framework
and i assume you already have the data
Yes
by some means
It's called a loop
you use
<template>
and
forEach
and
wait
keep going
im typing
then you like
use
document.createElement
and
appendChild
and then
you have things
in fact
CodeTools does this
I'm doing it in rust while typing
Like
you will see what I mean
Then
In my on click
to_html
is a helper function
That takes a ToHtml interfaced object
and calls to_html on the vec
but
Obviously this is POC
how is that supposed to run
yew
lol
“i dont wanna use a framework”
I didn't say
I didn't want to use a Rust framework
I'm just
I realllly dislike JS
but from an efficiency standpoint...
also that is possible
just
like
do you see
why I like this
yes
because
you dont wanna use js
No
It's because of the typing
I don't have to manually index json stuff
GraphQL
serde turns that json into a struct
has typing
and structs
TypeScript
does typescript have this feature
since then I will look into typescript
typescript
has
types
hence the name
Does it have structs
like this
or classes
like this
um
Yew seems like react in rust
it relies on wasm
which is bad
do not rely on wasm
See
this is
ts has interfaces
exactly what I want
this is literally what I was saying before
can it
turn json into its typed thing
and then like
look idk i dont use ts
also why shouldn't I use wasm
doesn't it work on phones
it probably does but like
performance
is bad
Um
Um
I thought that
and also
firefox
WASM was literally made for better performance
*yawn
does not support multithreading
I mean
if this tool works well for me I still wanna use it
If it makes web dev fun again
i wanna see something made with it
Then I will
make the emotes interface with it
no like right now
in a bit
i gotta submit some work
no one that exists
already
that
someone spammed it
this is more useful
theres no
wasm
there is
it worked for me
i see
lol
chrome issues
idk
its just like
im here to make flexible, scalable, reliable web apps
safari
again
tell me when JS can do what I showed you with serde
and I will gladly look into it
use react
do you want to see how I wrote the emotes cli v2
i literally
removed a lot of code
and used this serde thing
also like
i dont get how like
idk
i kinda wanna learn rust
but
i have no use for it
that's what I said as well
but it is useful
well for you
i mean
cli applications
you are a systems person
kinda
i could write it all in bash if I wanted to
also multihangman is a thing
i still want to destroy diesel and find a better orm
that's why I haven't been working on it
i hate the rust orm
i hate. it.
orms are for relational databases
yeah um
the arangodb one is bad too
i thikn the only one that I can tolerate is the mongo one
but
m o n g o d b
n o s q l
someone wrote a couchdb crate
i like react
its good
I tried it
if you have not used react
I couldn't stand it
why
other than js
I remember it being really obtuse
I really liked vue though
what
how is it
obtuse
let me find my old code
this
yeah but if you know react you can do react native
i think it's on a pi somewhere
flutter
no
actually maybe ill write my applications in kotlin
flutter is bad
ios
Oooooh
web apps
dont even mention active record
nothing is as good
Active Record is THE standard for orms
*sigh
what
maybe ill try sinatra
i like
it might be a good balance
use only
very popular things
you should not
if i can
also rails is popular
shopify is written in rails
yes
and there is a lot of documentation for it
on the web
but i wanna write my next app with jamstack
rails has react integration
i used react a little in this
Ruby
lemme find the file
and then
it's a mess
since this is react
like wtf is this
like why cant i make this
in pseudocode:
<input a="field[]" onclick="addField" />
def addField
{ document.getElementById(parent).add(input_component.to_html()) }
no
but you get the idea
one more for remove
and that's it
idk i like react
its better
than like
I can't stand it
writing everything myself
yeah I agree
i effectively wrote my own react
but imma try vue
for CodeTools
no not vue
yew
yew
ok
try that
make something simple
then show me
I will
hey cy
what should I make
with Yew?
yes
ill try something
the same thing i made
with react
ok
it must be identical
the styling may be different
mine has like
no styling
whatever
the header is red
ill figure this out tomorow
i have work it seems
bye
bye
Haha
He just settled for an Xbox and other compensations
both sigh’s are good to go
cy and sai
hi ramesh
i will start rewriting codetools in react
which should be relatively straightforward
because i put most of the css in a css file
rather than leaving it on the elements
which i would have to translate
jdkjfkjf
words
yayay this works
what works
my proxy
ah
but now
go to
ok
it work
hmm
ok
birds by coldplay is a great song
ok
i listen
Yes
it's in english too
lol
Birds go woof
what does the fox say
my phone’s wifi
is broken
*sigh
and my laptop
greenscreened
ah nice
IRQL not less or equal
this works now
including syntax highlighting
this doesn't work
also im now working on rebuilding CodeTools with react
Ramesh likes SCSS
should I turn my blog into a static site blog template
like anyone can use it
like hugo
I was thinking about it
Markdown links:

(complicated bracket)[idk if this bracket is the link or not]
*cough
tf
are those
and why do you have so many
they are pictures
of math problems
i see
to load into a file
i am using react
and i like it
it like
is logical
and it doesn't trigger my spaghetti alarm
like vanilla js does
Idk
I think imma write the serde thing in js
ok
Elm:
Nix:
im thinking of making some sort of like
implementation
where like
clients can connect to an MQTT broker
and then the server can publish reload requests
so that like
lets take the codetools example
if a teacher changes the code
it signals to all the open clients
to reload their page
hi im the newly styled modal
i made a decision
toooo much box-shadow
way too much
yeah i thought so too
so i lessened it a bt
good
imma write emotes's ui in yew
why?
u dont need that much shadow
I have an emotes cli
lemme tell you
it looks better
so I write the emotes cli in rust
not in a jpg
over telegram
oooo
and then
no i write the emotes client in rust
as a library
and then the web UI and the CLI call the same thing
you can also write them both in js
no
hmm
smart
I already wrote this code
so
i just have to tweak the structs a bit
no im just saying like
and the endpoints
so i dont need to write it again
this is not rust exclusive
I know
but serde is
serde is something both kotlin and rust have
but I ruled out kotlin despite its being able to do react
just because I looked at react and I felt it was complex
imma work on my fancy loading bar
plus the shared codebase thing
serde is THE killer feature every language needs
please make it an actual loading bar
i dont get serde
no i cant do that
it's basically it turns your json into a class
also it only appears for like
whic means
0.5s
you can call methods  on it
but
how
does it like
convert
the scripts
it uses a rust compiler plugin
called a derive
aka it gets all the fields and sets them as instance variables
so essentially your whole code could be in a serde
it takes the thing like
a.a = json['a']
a.b = json['b']..
and automates it for you
um
cant you like
destructure
an object
no
i mean
not in python no
in js you can do a.a
but you cannot do
you cant
validate the models
so if some field is blank when serializing
you have to do that manually
serde will just take that field
and check
ok is this blank?
throw error if blank
if you tell it to
with an annotation
um
im a little lost as to the use
of this
but
ok
ok
so
listen
you know what an ORM is
yes
not really
*sigh
you know how mongodb is literally just
glorified json
bson or whatever
yes
theres a mongoid library
for ruby at least
it's called mongoid
but
what it does:
it takes your mongo things
and turns them into ruby classes
with instance variables and objects
ah
ok
so i get that
serde
does this
without mongo
so instead of mongo
you can use it
with your own apis
idk
its like
you still have to like
define
lots of things
yes
but it's not that bad
and it's useful
type safety is nice
but
type unsafety
is much easier
not with serde
literally every single rust project uses serde
like ok
what you do is
i have a config file
i define a config struct
serde
will turn the file into a struct
and I can have methods on the struct
etc
whereas
you have to deal with a json object without that
like type safety is just like
easier to read
so its effectively
a class
and easier to deal with
yes
that you can populate
with an api
yes
but im saying you can extend this
i see
so I add
like
save()
and delete()
and it can do http requests
so I do like
a.get(1)
a.delete()
that doesnt exist yet but like
ok
serde makes it easy to do this
imma work on my loading bar
bye
*sigh
bye
hi
prettier
made my
4 simple modals
80 lines long
like expanding things to make them look nice is ok
but this...
'murica
‘drump
i am looking through the prettier settings
to make it stop
doing this
to my code
hi wanna tip
to make your code 200 lines shorter
set your prettier settings correctly
That’s 40%!
codetools-vanilla is at about 600 lines rn
codetools-react is at about 400 lines rn
Intéressant
numworks done charging
Nice dark room
for full lights
for no lights
for half
and so on
Why not 0 for no
because
And like equal to full
realize
no
if you do it like this
then
it goes up
the keyboard
also 0 and 100 compete for 0s
and 100 has more 0s
so it should get 0
lol
I see
I am stupid
I forgot 0 is next to 9
Not 1
lol
this is not programming
0 comes last
not first
Yea i just saw it so
Yea
Idk what to do anymore
codetools-react is nearing completion
oooo fancy
its not all react
but
the editor
which is the actual interactive stuff
is being rewritten
Huh
the rest of the app is like
literally
a login screen
and a myAccount screen
Nice one
i fixed it
my making more
async functions
lol wait
codetools-react
dropped
to
380 lines
hi my name is the MX Master 3
my back button
Jesus tf
goes back
once
then
it goes back twice
then
then
um what
then
it goes back
3 times
?
what does ur back button even do?
every click of everything except L/R click
is registering 3 times
um
idk what to say
cause mine register once
except mabye the gestures
lol now its doing it 4 times
those i usually have to do it a certain way
wtf
um
thats not good
id say
i think its the options software
get ur mouse exchanged
i mean possible
cuz if i mess with it
it changes things
also rebooting my PC fixes it
idk man
hi im interested in rebooting rn
do u have the mouse drivers?
those r things id assume
mx master drivers
i need to terminate Logitech options
and restart it
i need to figure out how to do that
um quit
idk i think mine always runs in the background
but its so neglible that it doesnt do anything
like the app isnt even open
idk its breaking stuff
i need to find it
and kill it
wait now we’re back down to 3 registers
what if
u somehow have like 3 instances of the app?
yeah that's what im thinking
something like that
either use the terminal
3 but
like
and like find the pid that way or just like look up logitech options on that
just kill em all
ok
hi akhil
now my scrolling doesn't work
um what??
other than R/L click
doesnt ur comp handle scrolling?
well not for this fancy shmancy mouse
like my comp works on everything xcept for the fancy thumb button
but i usually just turn off the mouse and on again
well no if you dont enable Options
it works fine
on its own
idk
i restarted Options
and now
all is well
smh
now to figure out why 2 http requests
that are the same
do
different things
tf does activity monitor say
why do i have virtual memory size
and then real
virtual memory
is the ram you downloaded
yes
ah i see
akhil
real memory is the ram that comes with the computer
ur dumb
makes sense
exactly
smh akhil
wait
what if
i could use
cloud memory
like
you can
ah
on plan 9
you can mount ram
cpus
gpus
and everything else
what is plan 9
thats so cool
it's like
the failed successor to unix
imagine mounting all ur ram from different machines
that basically is like a distributed OS
so they can share files and resources
i see
i need to debug my http requests
for codetools-react
i mean
but does really anyone like that
emot
yes
i need to do my http requests
bye
i need to do english and gym
i dislike doing a one minute video for gym
wait
im gonna do
github dns
um
that is a thing
that is a thing?
why have i not heard of this
right u reminded me
idk how they did it
i need to actually add an ssh key to my github
not
github dns
and mabye a gpg key idk yet
im wrong
okay i was about to say
i need that in my life
how does one generate a gpg key?
this is the
provider
im gonna use
yes
this is bueno
wait
i send u my token
cloudflare has a dns
it doesnt work
idrc
for wildcard certificates
for freenom domains
um yea
smh
that took a hot minute
k lets try this
ah more chinese stuff
I mean cloudflare has a dns
Or
Hear me out
Why not make ur own
Bind took a hot minute to configure
at this point
ill just
use the chinese dns
sure
but u could always host ur own
just forward 53 to a debian machine that hosts bind
and bam dns
Tencent
damn they r like Tata
how about we try this AFTER
i get emotes to even work
to run
Forward to reverse lunge: Gluteus, Hamstrings, Quadriceps, Core
dont mind that
i just need to write it somewhere so i can say it
rails is gonna be a pain
Heroku?
Ramesh Uses NixOS
cloud foundry?
u can use heroku on nix
no
heroku
is cloud
to deploy
but idk i usally just host my stuff
my wifi is broken
on my phone
it just
refuses
to connect
ive been on cellular since yesterday
cuz i havent had a chance to reboot the router
cool
that's good
i see
im setting up a dockerfile for rails
i gave up on nix
im gonna run it using virtualisation.oci-containers
my phone is starting to refuse to install apps
it doesn't have enough storage
when you get a 100 on a physics test
when you never get less than a 95 on a bio test
the whole year
same with me with physics
because
retakes exist
with no retakes
In fact I think the lowest I got was like a 96
yes also the retakes
only let you retake the problems you got wrong
and if you fail you lose no points
i did no retakes in bio
i was like
ok cy
really good
i dont like bio
at bio
i got a 70
on one of the tests
i see
i disliked chem less
i like physics
ha
I gave up
ill do my thing tomorrow
i forgot to define the function
it's not that hard since it's no longer using nix
lemme go define the function
k
imma add yew to emotes soon
if i can get the thing to deploy
ok
joe biden
dot com
yes
that is like
an easter egg
yes
they use varnish
also it's gone now
no wait
https
im not interested in your uncontrolled input
2-*sigh
discord
is dead
this is painful
Um
Hi
Is school at 7:35 or 8 today
Anyone pwease
8
Its a normal Wednesday
cool
YES
Finally
How did it take this long
I had it already
send link
no
i mean it depends on the price
u gonna buy too
maybe
send link
im in the market atm
if the price is legit then it's probably real
Whoops
Lol
Lol
Bruh it’s not letting me it’s on AliExpress
you can buy things on aliexpress…
lol aliexpress
that's like
i've done it before
gearbest
i ordered a 3d printer from gearbest
ask on a discord
and it took
2 months
to arrive
i got banned from this
because i said that vaccination stock was bad
so they were like "stop saying this"
and i was like "where"
and they just banned me instaed
good solution tbh
im trying react native
ideally i can get an app on ios as well
but that requires mak
yup
vm
and an ifone
this
nah u dont need one i think
xcode has ios sims
i need an iphone
for testing things
but
yes
i could use a vm
i want one with GPU acceleration ideally
if u want ill just test stuf if u need it
no i wanna do it myself
then yea a sim prob will be ur best bet
unless u have an actual iphone
u could load it onto
i have only an iPod Touch with ios 12
I need a good mac vm
um
just get an image and load it
wdym
u prob can get an ios iso
mac iso?
yea whatever
osx
ok but
i need to run it
with GPU acceleration
cuz otherwise
it just is like
unusable
Vmware fusion
hi that's a mak thing
Vmware workstation
that kosts monie
Is free
no it told me
you get 30 days
Um
I got fusion for free
fusion
is
mac
Ik
But im pretty sure workstation is the windows counterpart
i mean alternatively i could just get an iso and boot it
directly
And it has a free one for startups/personal
but also
it didn't work
it did
but
no gpu acceleration
so it was like
really slow
Hmmm
graphically
Thats weird
i mean it was fast
like in benchmark
but
there is no gpu
so all the graphics
are just like
not
appropriate
Huh
Thats really weird
Hmmmmm
see the other issue is that like
im using Ryzen
and most of the macos vms are for intel
Yea
It should still work
lemme look up more tutorials
Yea u should
I wanna like reinstall osx
But im very confident that some files that i really need will be lost
lol is this all i have to do
Virtualbox?
no that's vmware
Huh
If it is
That would be very easy
Oof
im not actually using the latest version
the tutorial said
it only works
on this version
Huh
Idk fusion has a button called gpu acceleration
I need to make my windows vm tho
Hmm
maybe i could make it work with VirtualBox
Probably
I dislike virtualbox unless its for linux vms
Then its fine
its free tho
i mean
i could also try
hyperv
U could
Should i make a osx vm
i mean sure
but like
ur on a mac
so
i would not assume it to be that hard
Its super fricken ez
Cause all macs have recovery partitions
So if u just add a drive and boot a vm into the partition
Itll install mac
The products were only for preorder
sadge
they are bulk selling mining cards tho
Ooo thats cool
Um
Why r dr seuss seuss books trending
they are banning them
they are ceasing publishing
certain ones
because they are
racist
Wait actually?
yes
Damn
it was on TV yesterday
Those books were so good tho
just 6 are being banned
dammit why u have to use mediafire
Um
I would recommend catalina
no
i will use
big sur
If u say so
r u making a vm or hackintosh?
vm
I dislike big sur
yes we know
but i want the latest version
regardless
Fair
Its glitchy, but if u want to update software its necessary
btw i wasnt kidding
create a recovery image with a tool its much faster
what tool
follow this to get the file
dont do any of the other stuff its for hackintoshing
that's the terminology page
you sent me
there is the page for creating it in windows
what gpu do you have
Radeon RX570
ok thats fine
but im trying to make a vm
ik but you can use this to get the recovery
wait nvm
tbh idk what i even need
I forgot it was different file types
honestly just hackintosh its not that hard
wdym
i need like
a drive
to install it on
Thats gonna take forever
no kidding
you can partition the one you have and install it on half
matthew.
i just
like
upgraded
my ssd
cuz i used it entirely
i will not spend
then what happened to the old one
my precious
500gb
i mean i could do it on that one
true
hackintoshing to big sur is the most difficult what cpu u got?
Ryzen 5 3600
thats fine
it will just emulate a intel one
wait
what if
i hackintoshed
my laptop
its intel
i saw some guy
at a hackathon
if it has a touchscreen it loses that functionallity
who had hackintoshed
a yoga 720
with touch
he came to me he said
oh i have the same laptop
but mine runs macos
and i have a touchbar
on my screen
wow
if u need help let me know
good luck
i need help
oh ok
the only reason i want macos
is for ios development
and testing purposes
wait
so i dont need much
but
u have workstartion pro right?
i do need
yes
try workstation player
i have that
how do i
like
run my workstation pro images
on workstation player
just like import it
huh
its like a universal image i think
they all use the same filetype so that u could import it
wait
wait
hold on
its
no that wouldnt work
booting
oh oh its doing something
Is that the vm?
yes
a a a a a a p l e
thats not good
ah its broaken
WTF
hold on
thats crazy
does it work
like gpu acceleration
if this has gpu acceleration
ill be damned
yeah I had a vm too but it was super slow
lol no gpu acceleration
ah
oof
minimizing a window
wait
still like
locks up the system
do u think
that if i make a working mac vm
and send it to u
i had to follow a very long set of instructions
it would have gpu acceleration
to get this working
on my AMD
hmm
i can probably enable it
just hackintosh it takes 2 days max
yeah but then i need to like
boot into it
which is a pain
nope you can dualboot
well but i still need to shut down windows
which is a pain
oh
i need to go to class
um what
Who needs 3d acelleration anyways
i mean i would like it
i need to be able to minimize a window
without my system hanging
for a minute
thats the problem with VM's I had the same issue even on intel and the igpu
APUSH:
HUSH:
oo
why is the teacher playing japanese music
i wonder
lol
Lol
Lol
ramesh forgets
json exists
waot
someone tell me why react native wont compile
imma erase it and start over
shoot
no
my computer’s gonna bluescreen
why did i hit delete
see switching to react was nice
because
it meant much easier
things
like
title
like
if you change the title
it just updates the metadata state
which is automatically uploaded
so i can just add as many things as i want
as controlled inputs
and they will just
automatically update the metadata
and be uploaded to the server
with no extra code
fail quickly in order to succeed sooner
huh
yeah
please help me
whats up[
do u have the bracket
yes
im filling it out
but i dont understand this
“class bracket”
just put the one you like more
ok
then we will vote later
ah ok
tf sam
what happened
Cy explique
um
on ne peut pas
mettre
ca
en mots
j’essayes de faire marcher mon application React Native
cyfinfaza: I'm trying to get my React Native app to work
mais il ne marche pas
et je ne sais pas pourqoi
Mleo37: and i don't know why
when you click this
I WILL NOW BE DEMONSTRATING
A LOWER BODY
RESISTANCE
EXCERCISE
ah very nice
i did mine yesterday
im like
how can i do this
without showing off the mess
in my room
and i figured it out
i got just the right position
Cy W
very nice
i need to know make a live video of me solving a problem
and explaining
wdym
but idk how im gonna do that
wdym
for math?
yes
wdym a "live" video
like i have to solve the problem
while explaining
um
do this
get like
a
box
or something
put ur phone on it
with the camera hanging off
or do the whole thing in LaTeX
i mean i could
but i think she wants like paper pencil
hold the phone with your left hand
write
with your right
or the other way depended on your handedness
apparently left-handedness is the dominant trait
idk how that works
I wanna learn to write with my left hand
i dont like this idea of handedness
wait what?
i thought right handedness is dominant
wait
wait
nvm
its not
r they even traits
it was something else
yeah its genetic
that makes sense
actually?
i think so
i thought it was just whatever u started doing as a child just sticks
that's what i think
ambidextrous was a genetic i think
idk
science says its a trait
i say its not
well this is gonna be tough to record
i dont think i need my face in it tho so
i say i can learn to write with my left hand
if i wrote things
which i dont
2021
maybe ill do all my math hw today with my left hand
just because
its the only thing i actually write
Time to record in 720 on my phone
Whats the google classroom upload limit?
Or drive upload limit
idk
25GB
or something
per file
or 100GB
idk
Huh
you get unlimited storage tho
so that's not an issue
also how many mins
do you expect to record
3-5
ok so like
if you compress
on telegram
you can like
get it to
7MB per minute
Do i need it to tho?
no
you dont
but just saying
I think classroom can handle like 1gb upload
idk
At 1080 60 a minute of video is 175 mb
you will not be above 1GB
Thats for sure
Yes
I need to find a box
apple xBox
Box X
with AirBox
Haha
for instant
um
what ever a box needs to do
instantly
I dont have a box
ok then
do this
you have furniture
sure
nah its not clear enough i think
i also cant write backwards and upside down
lol

good enough
ye
it looks crazy from my end
I'm going to switch out my audio system
calum recorded that
with my equipment
notice how like
there are 3 sides
to a delta printer
and
we couldnt decide which camera to use
so we put one on each side
Perfect
Two books and a long camera lens
just get the focus right
ah everything fell
imma remove the camera lens
nice job
this is my testing image
for testing servers
and protocols
and services
and everything
this is what i sent Monsieur Aref on his birthday
they did a padlet
i posted that
time to record this bad boy
ugh
its not tall enough
i wanna do that ltt thing
it cant view the whole page
with their wallpaper
on 2 vms
running side by side
just hold it
with ur hand
its gonna be so damn schakey
it gets the point across
and shows you did the math
i guess
im dislike this alot
im going over 5 minutes
what kind of a math problem is this
its really a problem
trig identity
isnt it
ah
verify the equation is true
and i gotta explain my work so
we never did if
we only did proofs
and simplifications
yea thats what this is
oh
ok
now does it
i wanna try straight up booting the macos iso that i used for that vm
like natively
not as a vm
Tower
TOWER
Its the leaning tower of pizza
pizza
Etcher is complaining
it doesn't like BigSur.iso
it says it wont boot
No boot partition
Yea thats also for windows
Use rufus
Itll add boot partitions
huh
ok
Well it should
I used it for windows and it added it
So it should do the same
it wont do it
akhil
why
why
why
why do you put a lens
on top of that
if you drop the lens you lose tons of monæ
dont worry
i dropped it
so its fine
i cant break something twice
this is a huh moment
1GB per second
using the cheapest NVMe usb reader on amazon
that's 8Gbps
which means that its actually using USB 3.2 Gen 2
cuz USB 3.2 Gen 1 tops out at 4Gbps
it also means that
the USB connection
might actually be the bottleneck
and not the reader
cuz USB 3.2 Gen 2 can do theoretical maximum of 10 Gbps
and this is getting real close
This
is what I have to do
it has now taken longer to build this package
than to just
write it
hi ramesh
can you tell me
the right way
to backup
an ssd
like image the entire thing
like do you know any way
that does not involve
proprietary file formats
um
dd
also clonezilla
but yu probably want dd
also cy sets up a light system
that is my lights
?
?
it's base64 encoded
white blank page
what is my "light system"
your like
ahk things
and whatever
ah
my keyboard controls
those are like
11 lines of ahk
one for each setting
the one with polyatomic ions on the bottom
um
in a bit
im in linix rn
and i dont have much access to it
also
someone explain to me this brand name
its one that may get pretty good SEO
lol
this disk is being imaged
Gnome Disks
is good
it just
images
my disk
i tested it with a flash drive
and it worked
flawlessly
so now its time for the real test
imma image this nvme
then
wipe it
and see if i can recover it
and have it still be bootable
when i tested on the flash drive it was still bootable
it was a windows installer media
i imaged it
wiped it
made some random partitions
filled them with some stuff
then
imaged it again
then
wiped it
then restored the windows install medium
it was still bootable
then i wiped it
and restored the second image
and everything was right where i left it
so i am confident
that this will work
but now i have to be doing AP Seminar bye
have you ever tried flashing a linux installer iso to an nvme drive
I blinked
and it was done
and consequently
all data that was on that nvme
should be gone
would you like to hear my relative speak about social geography
in french
im listening to it for my audio log
Um
is tihs your relative
Nadine Cattan
is my relative
idk exactly her relation to me
she may be a second aunt
what even is that
idk this was a random gif
idk
no like
a second aunt
idk what a second aunt is tbh
a second aunt
um
so flipgrid just ike
broke my video
a first aunt is the sister or sister in law of your parent
they're like "ok let's let this person upload"
and then
it doesn't upload
a second aunt
ah
so like a distant relation
its like one generation removed
like
my mother's
father's
sister's
mother's sister's daughter
child
no that's a cousin
a direct cousin
aunt is one generation older
idk
gn
gn
im enjoying
my storage
that I now have
now that I can back up the contents of unused SSDs
fun ad
i like this ad
its a clock
that is accurate
in the shape of an oreo
im BitTorrenting some random sketchy hackintosh image
cy is running a 256 gb disk image
through the LZMA2 Ultra compression algorithm
using 7zip
the results so far are not bad
Hmm
Im about to take the unit 8 test for chem
Im dying
gl
Its eh
Some were a bit weird
Why is it 300$
chem test
ever
.
yea
It was
awful.
it was not so good
in all ways
the mc was the hardest imo
i did not finish
how
i usually finish 20 minutes early
i finished early
21 questions
yea with 15 minutes or so
yea
and they're all formatted wrong
and they take forever to load
and the teacher is talking in the background
and we are not allowed to have our notes on our screen
we have to use another screen
to have our notes
or u could have printed them
same thing
thats what i did
also my periodic table
the interactive one
yes
u couldnt click
on it im assuming
cause it would notify the teacher
we cant click out of the test window
so i have to use my laptop
yup
and then like
the boxes
are all
formatted wrong
its like
please
for the love of god
right
if you are making a test
they didnt subscript
check it
before
some of them did
assigning
to students
and then like
i get \text{OH}subs#usb_2)d{l)\
as the question
and its like
YES
THIS WAS SO FRICKEN ANNOYING
cause its in latex
*smh
i gtg to ap semminarre
but no one can just read latex code
mr y is in a car
that's
funny
mr y mr y
they are invading
they will take over
imma try and do some hackintosh business
which will likely fail but whatever
Thats um
Dangerous
i was going to say
try opencore
yeah imma try opencore
hes not driving
hes pulled over
Ah
Then its not as bad
I thought he was driving
While zooming
no
now how do I make my opencore work
lets see
OSX-KVM
or yeah I could run it in linix
but
OSX-KVM
that like
makes it really eays
kinda
defeats
the purpose
yeah good luck with windoze
im not making a vm anymore
im making an actual one
that boots
from my nvme
that I wiped
and backed up
using Gnome disks
*sigh
i was thinking of doing this
i have one of those enclosures
also if you think linux is hard
to install
good luck with hackintosh
it's 20 times worse
i dont
its really easy
you just flash the installer
then
run it
and it does everything for you
yes good luck with your mak
uh
you have to like
manually configure the usb ports
wait
virtualization doesn't work
so this is out of the question
tbh
i would encourage hackintosh
like
baremetal
wdym
since idk how to do it on windows
in a vm
so just install it on a drive
no i want to use opencore
use opencore
for real
did you hear
this
idk
why openscore is gone
my problem
is that
apparently these do not support virtualization
on AMD
you want to run
a mac vm
in osx
no
i want to run an iOS vm
in macos
*yawn
idk get an intel then
*sigh
or use
osx-kvm
since that works
link?
Ok hold on
i
U cant run an ios vm
you remember your stupid pi issues?
Yea
so JP had the same issue
and he fixed it
U can run a simulator
by changing his subnet
Yea i also fixed it
that is a VM right
Wait really
Kinda
it requires AppleHV tho i think
idk
should I try installing osx-kvm
imma do that now
U know what the fix was
but i dont have enough storage
It has happened multiple times to me
i could install a fresh version of linix
on my ssd
then
I just had to close tmux and open it up again
install macos
yes
also you miht be able to
if you have another gpu
pass through your gpu
i have 1 gpu
i want to pass through my gpu
i mean
i could like
go get another GPU
yeah
i mean you can pass through your one gpu
it's just like
hard
you ahve to ssh into your desktop to set it up
since the display will break
i see
wait
but then
how does
lemme just try the simple way
imma get some lubuntu
and put it on my nvme
or should I use Pop_OS
probably lubuntu
since its
better
*sigh
what is this
dont use lubuntu
lubuntu is ugly
and garbage
use pop os
but its lightweight
i mean
you could probably get away with ubuntu server
if all it's going to do is bootstrap a macOS vm
right and then I could like
use ssh
and pass my gpu
the problem is
or
virt-manager
what is that
it's a GUI manager for vm
so if i use ubuntu server
and connect via ssh
For libvirtd
then i can pass through gpu
yes
but
i need to connect
ubuntu
to wifi
hi welcome to my house
Network manager
ok so i have 3 options for what to install on my nvme
1. lubuntu
2. pop os
3. ubuntu server
This
um
ok
Ubuntu server will have everything u need
And its just nicer imo
for my macos vm
and then like
so
it will just like
take control of my display?
im a little confused
yes
the gpu will get passed through and then it will pass through to your display
but
in order for my gpu to be passed through
u have to disable the gpu
so there wont be any display output
until the vm starts
ah
and youre saying
ive also only gotten a single gpu passthrough to work on arch
osx-kvm
will like
and it took a few hours
find it automatically
U could
Technically speaking
no it will not
Also just like install proxmox
so how to i make it do it
this
look at the github
k
also
look at VFIO
not only does the bootloader exist
but it aims
to imitate macos
huh
this seems like
a bootloader one could use for lunix too
I am now installing Ubuntu Server
have fun
ubuntu wants a network interface
but I have none
are you using wifi
yes
you need to like
Ah
bcmwl-kernel-source
actually it gives an option to install without network
idk what wifi you ahve
yeah do that
then you can add the networking stuff later
ok
wait so I can first install the osx kvm thing
test if it works
and then
then try gpu passthrough
do the gpu
yes
ok
A start job is running for Wait for Network to be Configured
it will
time out
1min 57s / no limit
wait
it timed out
told ya
ok now how do I do wifi
idk
you have to find your wifi brand
like the adapter vendor
who makes your adapter
its an intel I think
wht
but its ASUS branded
do this
ok
and show us what the output is
it
detects ur wifi
sudo apt intsall NetworkManager
then it will give you a nice
oh wait
you cant
haha
you cant because you dont have any internet
lol
i love this issue
um
Um
i can use my phone
Ip link whatever up
as a usb ethernet
yeah do that
me
i tried to sing
something
Wait doesn’t it detect it
and it sounded awful
it should
oh wait
no
you can probably get this to work
with
Yea its just down i think
wait for it
since ubuntu server is special snowflake
so they use
Ip link whatever up
hi cy
nvm
just use your phone
you might have to use netplan with that tho
hold on i had to connect a Bluetooth keyboard to my laptop
i am back
This i think will fix it
ok so how do i make it connect
to the internet
you use your phone
i plugged it in
did it not work
ip -c a again
also without the -c flag
it wont work
most important command line argument
Yes
uh
you have to use netplan
Ip link usb0 up
or that
no it's
ip link dev usb0 up or something
or like
ip dev link usb0 up
idk
U dont need the dev i think
ip link set dev <interface> up
Try this first
um
it worked
but
not
it is not
online
Ip -c a
Just
Use
also how do i change my password
Netplan
i made it all caps by accident
passwd
Just that
I also typed poweroff in my computer instead of my vm
So my computer is off now
lol its telling me
Good job
new password
must
differ
from old password
Caps
Lock
by more than just case
Is
Oh
You can probably change that
Google
*SIgh
whatever ill just leave it as is
lol i just changed it to password
then changed it back
lol
that also works
ok so now
how do i connect
to wifi
does the regular thing work
wdym
like
can you access google
no
ip -c a
does not work
ok
uh
not installed
wait
hold on
um
you could like
yea no
not installed
no
no
no
just
do this
you have to put this in the netplan config
and change
the enp3s0 to usb0
or
this
for wifi
hmm
ok lemme do that
this will be painful
yeah
without copy paste
netplan is awful
nmtui
is a gui
i just save to usb and copy over?
in the terminal
no
you have to mount the usb
*sigh
linix
no
this is
the server version
what should i do
you edit the
/etc/netplan
ok
lemme do that
this
see this
wlp4s0
don't mind
i do
sorry
just need to write it down
jk
makes a nixos vm
hi ramesh
with
it still doesn't work
your entire directory there
did you netplan apply
yes
what does it say
nothing
ip -c a
get rid
of the ethernets thing
also thanks for your wifi password
ok
lol
although i dont really care
wifi no work
still
fine
then
put back the enp7s0 thing
and change that
to usb0
i deleted it
um
under ethernets?
yes
put the usb0
with dhcp true
ok
ok it works
but not wifi obviously
ok NOW
but now i can install things
sudo apt install NetworkManager
unable to find package
get rid of the like
networkmanager
oh wait
wait
wait
wait
sudo apt update
then try the NetworkManager again
i mean that
and its not NetworkManager
on ubuntu/debian
its network-manager
oh
i didnt know
k now what
yea its NetworkManager i think on arch
nmtui
you might have to
sudo nmtui
maybe
but i was thinking
the systemctl service
right start
u also have to disable netplan somehow i think
sudo apt remove netplan
netplan is not installed, not removed
ok good
then it took care of that for you
just nmtui
ok
ok so now I'm online
now you can just
do what osx-kvm says
yes lemme try that
over ssh
ok
it might not work though
it opens a window
um
then how should i do it
um
you could use ssh X forwarding I think
but it's a pain
so what I would reocmmend
is using the libvirt xml that they give
and then using virt-manager to connect
wdym
i want it on the display output
from the pc
you can't do that
until
why
you install it
and then
pass through the gpu
i see
I mean you can
should i just do that then
yes
ok
you can try doing it first
first lemme install it
i mean
and see what it does
this link
cant u just install virt-manager on ur comp
he can
but you have to do an extra step
to add the vm to libvirt
normally it just uses qemu
im getting epilepsy from macos booting up
in verbose mode
lol
nah
the sound
i actually felt like throwing up
that is both a blessing and a curse
i love the sound
but then my parents can hear it
cause its so loud
what do i pick
no
you use
read it
i am doing that now
hi ramesh
the step to actually install
wants
gtk
yes
did you
yeah that wont work
so what do i do
dont use this
no
gtk is the graphical environment
which i don't have
stop
wait
im waiting
use this
need to install anything?
yes
libvirt
ok
how
apt install libvert
yes
no
not package
sigh
idk
wait
look it up
u need like a billion packages
no
libvirt ≠ kvm
but that's another thing
they install libvirt
look up how to install libvirt on ubuntu server
ok
then it's fine
k so now i did that
but
i was lazy to paste the command
how do i use virt manager
how to i connect to my vm
also
virt-manager
on windows
will this work with the gpu passthrough
no
but
that is a later step
ok so let's install virt-manager on windows
there is a win
surprisingly
wait they do?
yes
how to i install it
it gave me like
a whole folder
?
what
um isnt there an msi installer that u can download
theres
an msi
where
lol
i should have just used lubuntu
perhaps
probably
it would kill the wm anyway
and X
so
but it would connect to wifi
easily
and it would let me test in the GUI
meh
ok its installed now what
open it
add a connection
to ur desktop
um
what is the connection
like
ip
the ip
is there a prefix?
um no
24
or anything
ok
its the default
also check the ssh one i think
um
uncheck ssh
wtf
oh
qemu+ssh://USER@IP/system
wait
did you download virt-viewer
yes
no
use
virt-manager
not virt-viewer
that is why this is not working
um
where do i get the msi for that
um
oh ramesh id umb
didnt he install virt viewer?
you have to use wsl
it doesnt work on windows
wsl
has no
graphics
with xming
what
just do this
and now you see why i use linux
because i dont wanna do this lol
i could have use Lubuntu
yea
why dont u
reintsall
should i
no
use
kubuntu
kde is just as lightweight
but that's heavier
also to gpu passthrough
it kills the DE
so
yes
but
it's not changing the amount of resources being used
if i choose not to
then
lubuntu will suck
kubuntu won't
like
alright fine
fine
fine
if you want to use it as a linux
yes
i don't tho but ok
so I'm reinstalling
starting from scratch
ok
yeah but you won't need to deal with the wifi
true
also the installer is bigger
lubuntu's installer is really small
well
smaller
1.8gb
nixos: want to use our stuff? NO you ahve to go all in with the nix ecosystem
use nix-shell
etc
rather than 2.5
ok but
lxde
or lxqt
platform lockin
is awful
it doesnt even
has entered the chat
have
a compositor
it will have zero animations
and it will be ugly
and awful
i have used it
it is fast
rasbpian
real fast
is
different
no not raspbian
i have used lubuntu
the latest one
since they added search to the start menu
it is fine
but
I'm downloading
kubuntu
so
that's that
kde's also fast and lightweight
the animations are not
they are bad
i think they're fine
they look fine
meh idc anymore
i just want
something
that works
and i don't wanna argue
so im using
kde
kali linux
also idrc
4 of which are in the printer and are half full
so like
just use kde
or
oh is it not working because i took out the ram and forgot to put it back in again
I'm using kubuntu
it is now flashing
also this means i will be able to open the tutorial on the actual computer
and not have to use my laptop
which is awful
and i don't like using it
its small
and slow
and its gpu is dying
literally
things go black
and get blocky
on my screen
i mean mine does that sometimes
windows
developer perview
but that was when i had 15 windows open
probably
each running like 100 tabs so it made sense
the hell
funky smelling output
It is what it says it is
funky smelling output
what r we in the 80s?
help I'm stuck in full screen
and i can't get out
wdym
full screen
f11?
the qemu
ah
control alt g?
not work
you could kill it
why does control alt g not work
no i just like
wanna get out of the window
yes
control alt g
also the display is not scaled right
or like
like
control shift g
its
the mouse is stuck
right
not the right resolutoin
yes
it is stuck
control shift or alt g
it says at the top
wait ctrl alt f
that works
im dumb
wait
it seems im running deployment mode wrong
im like
surprisingly making progress on the nixos thing rn
which room cy
idk
I'm on a phone
so like
workspace 400?
ok
i believe i got the gpu passthrough working
but
now there's some other issue
I had an idea
On demand mac vms for friends
With gvt-g
i want my own mac vm
So you have gpu accel
Cy
what is this
Why
Not correllium
you should just
get a correllium
i want a fast one
that is not
remote
and does not cost
money
isn't correllium fast
it is remote
and it costs money
also i almost have this qemu thing working
wanna call
No
*sigh
i never
agreed to help you
lol
Correllium and what u r doing are not the same u know right?
yes
i do not want
i want my own vm
with gpu passthrough
Have fun
k
have fun as well
you may get gpu accelerated linux vms soon
nixos is fun
you specify a nix config
and it will give you a vm
I mean i think correllium is the only company that makes ios vms
didnt it get cleared by the court?
i cant type since i took a walk and my hands are frozen
Correlliums did
yeah
But globally and other companies no
I dont think so
what do you think
powered by launchnix
Is a good idea
I haven’t really learned nix but I’m assuming that it makes things easier
no
it makes things harder
Ooo a queue
this
Huh
ah
it crashed
this sounds like gpu sales
Yup
This is like the same thing
just like
dont say that in the atr stonks server
or you get banned
literally
if you say that
you get banned
without any explanation as to why
try it
maybe it's reproducible
mabye
idk
but guess what time it is
actually this is gonna suck
cause my keeb is connected to a usb hub in my monitor
which connects to my mac
but i would have to like unplug it and plug it into the comp
to use it
hi akhil
buy a kvm switch
Ah yes the best airflow ever
I dont know where id put it otherwise
Also the psu is downward intake
So idk
Tf is that?
xeyes
Those r eyes
Ehh i can see it
Should i lift it up?
Imma lift it up
With what is the question
that lens
Nah i only have one
Id need 2
lol
Honestly i could use some books
I need to do
work
But that feels like disrespect to the book
Ah have fun
ramesh is not in ap comp sci today
th
tf is that
okay
imagine ur having a debate
in zoom
and the teacher picks students to talk by whoever raises their hand
and u have ur hand rasied almost the entire time
but he never calls on you
what th do u do
imagine ur having a debate
and your teacher
is on the highway
and leaves
the meeting
haha that was funny
im so pissed
i had my hand rasied
yes i understand
but
are you like
but he called on people that raised their hands after me
one of those ppl
who like
raises their hands all the time
and they always call on you
i did this
nope
never
you see
in English
i always raise my hand
and she always calls on me
but then this one day
she like
refused
outright
to call on me
she was like
no
im done
well this is a debate
im not calling on you anymore
so he has to call on me
so that i can speak
but he didnt
at all
lol then if you get a bad grade you can go and complain
i tried so hard
yea mabye
i have to see
there is a listening part as well
aka notes
i see
but you can see
if you got a bad grade
on the speaking
he said he noted whoever was trying to speak
so i may be fine
cause the groups were alot larger
having ur hand up is what i consider trying
ms baker is not starting the zoom meeting
imagine
i am
ugh
forget it
ill complain to him
if i get a bad grade
yes
now
i have to figure out
why
the meeting
is not
cause she didnt start it
also i think he has a physics test today
lol lesson
do not
and didnt study for it
so thats prob why
click the meeting
before it starts
yea
i always do a minute late or so
welp at least today is friday
so i can chill
cy
did you fix your vm
no
that was easy
i almost made the GPU passthrough work
like i said
what happened cy
see
so
i blacklisted amdgpu
then
i added the pci ids in a kernel parameter
ok…
yes…
so then
i ran that script
on arch linux
wiki
and it said
the vfio was on
so then
but
it didn't work
it said it couldnt find the device
so then i opened the file
and changed the pci devices
it took several tries
but then
this happened:
it
like
the screen said some grub boot lines
that had stuck
from boot
that's good
and then
and then it stops
that is
when i ran the script
good
oh
the screen went black
but then
it never
showed anything
went gray
then
died
and the monitor said
no signal
but
that is not the main issue
the main thing
was that
the qemu
said
it could not find sata2
and sata3
so then
i like
modified the file
at that point
qemu wasnt directly crashing
but
nothing was on the screen anymore
qemu doesnt crash
the gpu doesnt passthrough right
when it goes grey that is a gpu passthrough issue
which is like
the issue i had too
well by gray i mean like
idfk how I solved it btw
that gray
of a dead lcd
not being controlled
yes that is a gpu passthrough issue I think
well but no
so
my monitor does this
it like
goes gray
no but ok
so
lemme describe 4 images
start:
2 lines saying boot initramfs or whatever
then (0.5s):
gray and dead
then (0.5s):
black
then
no signal
after i ran qemu
what happens after running qemu
the screen essentially goes black
but
it does that thing
my screen does
when it starts up
and goes gray with a black line through it
k
but then
it said no signal
and went to sleep
yes
that is a gpu passthrough failure
you have to like
idk what i did
i did it on nvidia twice
and i have done it on my rx 580
on arch linux
it took a long time
i have essentially this
i dont think i had to play with the vbios
but what i dont get is like
if the passthrough failed
wouldnt it just not work
like it used to
yes
or throw an error
that is called no signal
no
and it doesn't do anything
you dont understand
before
it was like
not changing
it would just stay
on that grub leftover
after i set the pcie devices correctly
yes
qemu fails to pass through
what was on the screen
like
it actually interfaced with the GPU
oh right
check your dmesg
i remember doing this
also did you try googling the issue
no
my eyes were hurting
and i had a headache
ok
so i quit for the day
do it now then
on that
i cannot
i am using my pc rn
and i dont wanna shut it down
i have school
fine
next period
i dont really
i have to fix emotes on rails
i see
4H fair app is gonna be fun
we might make it into a website
emotes on rails is a thing
ok but that makes 0 difference to me
cuz like
ruby
is great
it will
when there is a web site
in what way
so you can like
do things with it
i see
make a login system
with google login
no
you get a jwt
it's like doggo
in how you will log in
no
bad
too bad
when you make a website
you make it how you want to
lol
i did
yes
i made it with login
its harder
but its worth it
the thing is
I want to keep this simple
so
nah
just make ur own
yo akhil
hows ur
arch going
keycloak
myKettl
login is not hard
i will make that a thing
you just need like
hashing
and salt
i will be doing it in a second
i need to like lift and turn it around
i dont deal with the hashing and salt
sso
bcrypt takes care of that
done
yes
sso is google
or keycloak
simplicity
or
github
yea like one of those services
i could have used devise
but why
i would use google login
yes
everyone has google
and you do
what you want
remember
i dont
want
everyone to log in
true
only the people I want to use my service use it
because
they upload files
and I do not want them uploading child pornography to my server
but i think
a well designed system
can handle that
with public login support
Yes
But
I do not want to deal with this
this is invite-only
ok
so I will do it like
doggo
the end
yes
was about to say
i wanna finish codetools this weekend
r u doing it like doggo
bold goal
yes
you get a token
and you sign in
with the token
also that's insecure
why is it insecure
cuz you store a token
in the browser
ok and then
xss
you dont store tokens in a browser
also
tokens and passwords
are bad
google and Microsoft know this
its why 2fa is a thing
i mean cookies
doggo
did i say doggo is a good example
ok I might add oauth2 support
later
like with playtools
if you sign in
your password is not stored in the browser
isn't XSS a problem for any website
to keep you logged in
may i recomend that the tokens be like 256^256
like
a session is stored in the browser
i could xss you rn
with doggo
and get your token
by using xss from codetools
yes doggo is bad
because codetools
has an xss vulnerability
which is
wherein
you put
a <script> in the description
true
but like
that cant get my doggo token
also
then how can they get youre emotes token
if someone finds it
or sees it
or has access to your computer
or sees it in a file
isnt that
the case
or sees it in a chat
for like
a lot of things
yes but
like i could go in
and reset your playtools password
no
you cannot
you need the password
to reset the password
ah
and since the password is not stored in the browser
ok
you cannot see my browser
then
the token
will not be stored in the browser
but then how do they stay logged in
session id
yes
session management
playtools uses sessions
and session ids
ill just do something with rails
done
that is how to install emotes
why cant you just make like
a shell script
and run it
because
that is
painful
lol less painful than learning nix
idk i told my dad ramesh is learning about NixOS
and he told me
why not just use a batch file
yes
IntelliJ is awful
i do not like
intellij
it like
if i open the open file window
it attempts
to download
the entirety
of my OneDrive
to my pc
and if i dont let it
it completely hangs
and dies
Green
so effectively
i like intellij
i cannot use it
to open anything
oh
i dont use the cloud so that would be why
you can probably disable this behaviour
cy is thinking
about 4H today
he is unsure
a bunch of
higher people
are coming
is coming
akhil have you ever considered joining 4h?
that is scary cy
i have
and then?
why didnt you come
why didn't you ? ramesh
idk i was lazy ig
why
tf
did I add a sad face
idk ramesh
u do u
you should join our 4h club
it's like the time i texted some random girl in uwu speak and it sounded really flirtatious but i didnt mean that
we need more like
good people
like
just never do uwu speak
yes
i may try and get my makaws
working
or finish CodeTools
or
worry about 4H
i may try to get libreoffice to not take 10 hours to open
i need
to try bspwm
yup
im going to use bspwm or openbox
i forgot to have setup generate the secret key for rails
libreoffice
right that's a thing
it is a thing
that is insulting to libreoffice develoeprs
*sigh
my English class
Ah I have a health test
i forgot
is discussing
why
chicken
is not
a vegetable
luckily
you're allowed to look up everything
he said so
um
pasta on pizza
um
pizza with no cheese
pizza with no sauce
UMM
fundamentals of debate
i learned that mrs harding eats eggs in the morning
and she puts tomato sauce on them
HAL™
that is called a margarita pizza
is gud
i dont like cheese
yes
y
cuz cheezy
cheese is good
yuh\
its like
the 2 things you can make everything out of
milk and petroleum
lol true
milk good
i dont like milk
cheese good
or petroleum
milk is an acid
did you know
ph of 6.7
you dont notice until you drink like
plant based milks or whatever
that are not acidic
um ofc i dislike gasoline
and then drink regular milk again
huh
i like the idea of milk
like
a suspension
as a drink
who likes to drink gasoline?
no like petroleum products
i dont like
how everything
is petroleum
gasoline products are a thing?
not to eat
just in general
i dont like things
products made
with petroleum
ah okay
the problem with milk is like
its too dynamic
if you get fresh milk
and let it sit
it turns into
different things
each day
its just like
idk
also its an animal product
and i dont like animal products
um what?
vegan?
transitional-vegan
huh
so like
idk i can eat anything
i try not to eat meat
but
as long as its not red meat
anything goes
and pork
i think
we should stop
or lessen
meat consumption
i mean
eh
meat is the #1 cause of deforestation
yea but meat gud
like i said
lessen
yay
im done with school
eat it sometimes
but
not much
ramesh has no problem with this
lucky
im effectively done with school
we have a work period
i mean for the US its prob not gonna be a problem
and im working (for sure)
but with other countries it might pose one
yup
the problem with meat
at a fundamental level
is what we learned in Bio
last year
the energy conservation between trophic levels
the corn required to feed one animal to feed one person
could feed 10 people
so it takes 10x more resources
just in food for the animal
plus all the resources for the animal
like land
and emissions
and water
and energy
then there is the ethics discussion
about keeping animals in the places they are kept
and then
actually
theres the fact that like
those places
can cause pandemics
in fact
the coronavirus pandemic
may have been caused
by meat production
but that is just speculative
we dont really know
i mean
its unlikely
the thing is
they are really good places for viruses to thrive
and spread
and mutate
he let us out to do the quiz
i failed my math quiz
i am somewhat sad
but i musnt be
there is no time or energy for sadness
Alex Strasser is making the assumption i made
i also failed my math test
which is that
no one has improved
since last time
we met
but my dad corrected me on this
he said
cy
you dont know
maybe they are app experts now
and i am very good now
compared to before
Alex wants to present the existing app
but
i wanna make a new app
with new features
or take the old one and add much fun new features to it
it was made with Ionic
and i actually wanna turn the app into just a website
but
ionic apps
are websites
so that would not be hard
but i wanna add lotsa features
but meat gud
it taste gud
yes
so im not gonna stop eatin meat
cuz it gud
*sigh
the problem is like
the planet
mars
mars
yes
did you see
how hard
it was
for them to like
SPACE COWS
land
oh
i dont eat meat
yup
ive joined the chat
I am effectively done with skool
i am
done with school
but u eat animal products right?
have been done for like 20 minutes now
yeah like eggs
and milk sometimes
i do cp English so it is like much easy
more eggs than milk though
i do
ap engilsh
ramesh doesn't like milk
i do
i like
you dont like
ewwwwwwwww
cow milk
ewwwwwwwwww
i like
its ok
do you want me to make this political rn
es bueno
yes
lol
go ahead
michael
what is your party affiliation
libratarian
or however u spell
thats what libertarians say
yup
ah hck
i can do whatever i want and the gov can suck it
so
you can do cocaine
no
personally no
you can traffick children
well isnt it legal in some states?
and the government
shouldnt
but idk what other ppl do
intervene?
id
c
you dont
care
if people
traffic children
i do, that is why we should hav military and border security
but isnt that
contrary
libratarians are not agenst it
to intervening govt
intervening govt means that we should not hav gov restricting things like free businuess
so
to you
keynesian economics
is bad
explain keynesian
keynesian is basically like
when we go into a recession
the government
should increase GDP
by doing government things
and intervening in the economy
no
gov should not do that
the reason we hav ressissions is bc of gov
ah
so
we shouldnt have entered WWII?
what no
we should have entered WWII?
you know
wwii was defending our assets
that it caused the government
to do
a bunch of spending
which
as a direct result ended the great depression
making jobs, etc
act not a direct result
but, im not agenst wartime spending
and the gov should have done that
it was right
but thats
contrary
bc wwii was just
to what id think
k also then
should we kill the fed
i gtg cuz in person
end
lolk
this was fun
hi cy
hi ramesh
you were watching
i launched you into a political discussion with Michael
i think i have some more politicking tools under my belt now
i mean yea
economics is a fun subject
i wanna learn macroecon
yeah
id be down to learn both
which is why im gonna take it next year
i mean same, but i dont see a real benefit for micro
unless ur like accounting/learning game theory as well
game theory plus micro econ would make sense i would think
i bacc
but wifi die soon
ooh
hola
cuz i on bus
so i wait till bus leave
ah
wamesh u wanna continue discussion
yes
um
i was saying
do you want to abolish the fed
the fed reserve?
yuh
yes
why
it allows the gvmt to excess spend
like debt
the
fluctuations between recessions
are exacerbated
without the fed
but we would not have a ressession in the first place if we dident have the fed
uhm
and then
there was another
so there was a recession in the 1890s
before the fed was made
also the fed helps prevent inflation
without the fed
banks can just do whatever they want without being regulated
which means they can pull money out of thin air
but the thing is, that ressession was in argentina
lmao
wicth was caused by English trade
there was a recession in the 1890s
idk
that was messed up
the point is that there were recessions before the fed
by gvmt
yuh, but brought on by gvmt
also bus gonna go bye bye soon
so if i go away unexpectantly
haha
The lower of fone
Power
Ahhh
This is the effects of the rescission
Not wut caused it
this is
yeah but im saying
this
is false
because
there were recessions
before the fed
Yuh, but caused by gvmt
ah
point taken
ramesh
do you wanna call
let me
and help me
see this
no
with my mak
Lol cy got shut down
if you want help
lol not the first time
you can do it over text
no i cant
i dont have my computer
its taken
wdym
its hard to text
and it gives me a headache
when i dont have my pc
I just realized I can't eat meat today
Sad
why
cant you eat meat today
Lent
ah yes
that is a thing
I am roman catholic so I do the lent
that is unfortunate
i dont
want to
also you boldly assume I can actually help you
um
when I don't remember how I fixed this issue
cuz you can
I just
google things
a lot
yes but you know what to click
i dont
what
do you mean
by click
the results
you know which ones are relevant
Click the first one
and you understand linux better
yes
why dont you
learn linux
If that doesnt work click the second one
click on all of them
Yea
see the thing is
they tell me to do things
ur gonna keep
that are irreversible
asking me to
help you
forever
if you don't learn how linux works
no, ramesh
i will learn
by doing
and asking
That's not how I learn fortunately
I learn by reading books on the subject
also idc much about linux
then don't use it
buy a mac
its my only option
then if you want help
for what i search
you will text me
since I'm not calling you
*sigh
when you have time
tell me
im not doing this rn
it will happen faster with help
I will never have time
so ill wait
to call you
until i have some solution
I always have time
to text you
the other thing is it gives me a headache
the whole thing
it gives me one too
i spent
an entire day doing this
multiple times
the only other way I know how to do it is to use VMWare
that took like 10 minutes
to gpu passthrough
like not VMWare on linux
VMWare ESXi
Or proxmox
but then
you need
esxi
esxi
That takes like 2 minutes
is free
what is esxi
yeah also proxmox can do it
it's an OS
proxmos is based on linux and is free
so you can use that if you want
it's not as hard
For virtualalization stuff
ive done it before
on proxmox
Yea same
proxmox
U just gotta have the correct settings
theres a wiki guide on it
also proxmox's OSX vm is a bit more tricky
but theres a guide on that too
i did it before
what song is this
no
hey cy
have you seen the chinese captchas before
this is a dumb error
let me fix it
I love it
"Super-speshul screwdriver"
> insert something about cy's expert screwmanship
lol
hi
lisp is a strange programming language
lol ramesh
[Music]
i cant
stand
coding videos
lol
ramesh finds a way
to find problems
with everything you do
yes
that is
correct
tbh I dont mind it that much
i do the same thing
but yes you are doing it in case it was a goal of yours to
try and stop
for whatever reason
frankly we should be targeting a more symbiotic environment
idk
thats a wrong
we had a productive 4H meeting
likely one of the most productive
I am now leading the app
effectively
we are gonna do fun things
the dots represent support
and mentions
the 2 most mentioned things were
web app
and privacy
a private web app
an oxymoron in 2021 lol
how does a private web app work
?
lol
like
how
what do you mean by that
a web app
that
respects
yes but like
user privacy
did you know
like
my static site
respects your privacy
hi i made a joke
by not having any stateful components
i need to generate another cloudflare token
also the privacy concerns were more relating to live cams
at the fair
ah
how will it work then
idk we have yet to decide
how did I do this
now cloudflare wont even load for me
*sigh
I think cloudflare died
nvm
k i updated my api key
i wanna make the 4h app on a jamstack
and not make it an app
it will not be an app
it will be a webpage
web app
yes like yew or react
not yew
yes react
i said
like either
they are similar
yes
that idea
the framework
we might use ionic again
but idk
people liked the queuing idea
what is ionic
a ui toolkit
for building fancy uis
that pretend to be native
*sigh
then dont
what
is that error
basically
you cant
use the cloudflare api
to get a lets encrypt certificate
for a freenom domain
i see
then dont
what i need to figure out is how one web app
that like
is contiguous
can have
multiple pages
or paths
in the browser
react router
ha
louis rossmann
i saw his commentary on the M1 mac
he said
that
USB-C dongles
brick it
if they are not apple ones
imagine doing hardware design
and
he said that
the SSD is not replaceable,
but
that's not new
what is new
is that
some people
already have
150 TBW
with makaws
and so
their ssds are gonna die
and their machines are gonna become wonky
wdym
what is tbw
Terabytes Written
ah yes apple
i mean
cant u like
unsolder it
lol no
cuz
1.
its probably paired
2.
its probably signed
3.
if you try and buy a replacement
apple will cancel you
how would they sign an ssd
idfk
thats just like
what they specialize in
I mean
U prob can tie it in somehow with the t2 chip
akhil go to bed
theres no t2 chip
it's past your bedtime
but
Tf u mean
you can jailbreak this
Yea
so then how are they gonna stop you cy
Also this
Um
How
cuz apply dumb
Im assuming this is a different mac
Oh blog post time?
wtf happened
the thor thing is broken
USE SLUGIFY
im using my new emacs config
this is all
Do u use default emacs or doom emacs?
doom
zen mode
yes I know the font size is huge
Ah zen mode
I used to have it
I used to use emacs
I need to learn
How to type
Properly
yes
…
wait
python has data classes
hekcja;lfjkasl;kjd
this is basically what serde does btw
wtf is this
my nextcloud
is giving me
15 mbps
Sorta
But I'm not sure
Because I need virtualization
AppleHV
For the ios simulator
With gpu acceleration
And I heard hackintosh does not support AppleHV
let me check
The thing is I haven't directly tried opencore
Ok so yeah it wont work
So my question is what will
What are you using appleHv for
Cuz I know the ios simulator worked in VMware
Ios simulator
which one
Wdym
like how are you running the simulator
Through Xcode
I could try opencore
How long does it take
why do you need applehv for that
I can guide you through it
Cuz I think it requires it
it will take a couple of hours to a day
depending on if there is any issue
I see
I don't have any time today
But if you have time tomorrow early afternoon
Ok have a list of your hardware ready
Ok
Thx for the help
ah satisfaction
this is all it has just so that u know
its pretty bare bones
I know
I have used it
In my VMware
But it was so crap that like
That's why I wanna try something else
I need it for testing apps
And websites
Which is what it's designed for
yea its nice for that
So
i should get back into swift
Also the Mac is useful to have
No you shouldn't
React native
Flutter
nah
ill try this
Yes I prefer it
idk what imma make tho
ill think of something
You should join 4h
And help us with our app
i mean i may
Should I start any downloads
That might take a while
Yeah I’ll create a list they don’t take long tho
But it's like 14gb
Or something
Longest is like 10 mins but there is some work before u can do it
Ok
Wait
I wonder if u can do apple widgets using react
That would be cool
react native you mean
that's a good question
I mean even if you cant
it just creates an Xcode project for you
so you can just add them there
I need to read 4 pages of this paper
once im done
we can start
Ok
it might take me a little while tho
cuz its a boring paper
and I have to annotate it
and identify the effectiveness of its evidence
so id say like 30 mins
or so
Cool
hi matt
i am ready
Ok give me like 5 mins
ok
AMD Ryzen 5 3600
AMD Radeon RX570 (Ellesmere, ASUS RoG branded)
ASUS Prime X470-PRO
32 GB RAM (dual channel, 4 modules, 2 brands)
Intel Wireless-AC 9260 (ASUS branded, appears to be an M.2 on a PCIe converter card, also despite being called AC I belive it supports WiFi 6 AX, also has Bluetooth 5)
plz help
ah
just
change line 2 to
oooo
much thanks
discrepancy between 1d array and 2d array
I dident see that
yea
heh yeah
ur welcc
Yes
do you still need help?
If I wanna try catalina
Do I just
Replace
yes
The dmg
Ok
So I run the python thing
That gets the dmg
In the utilities
I don't have to modify the EFI?
nope
Hmm
Ok lemme try
im making things
i really like this sourcehut ui
like it's so clean
wait also matt
so how do I update
after I install
just through macos?
system prefrences
update
ok so no fancy stuff
just in macos
wait
actually i downloaded the dmg throgh the route to get it for opencore
I chose number 9
once that downloaded I ran the dmg and it went through a couple of cycles of starting and restarting, but then it worked
wait so
first
I run the python
to get catalina
yes
then
i install
then
i go back to the python?
to get big sur?
so i make a new installer
then just run it and let it restart a couple of times
no
you just run the dmg
oh run the dmg
ok
im just saying that this specific version worked for me
ok
lemme try the catalina
bye
Cy where do we submit the recording of the french thing
Lol wait is that due
I have no clue
Atm my computer is unavailable
Wait
I actually have a physical mac
The MegaWhack
huh
It has 2gb ram
I have a phsyical mac too
let's see how much ram it has
I also have a physical mac too
I have the screen of a broken mac
10240M
10 gigs
i also have a hackintosh
laptop
perhaps I should use opencore with it
and install 10.16
u mean 11?
no
10.16
?
11
big sur is osx 11
i thought they were the same
lmao
i will intentionally call it 10.16
i mean yea u might as well
i still call macos osx sometimes
so
its weird why they called it 11
yeah it's still unix
Macos might be booting
mac os 9
is like
not mach based
so
not xnu based
not nextstep based
so
windows 10 11.2.2
this is my actual desktop
Nice
*cough
the biggest one is xcode
I don't think wifi works tho
oo does it work
wifi never works
now try your ios emulator
if you want usb wifi
It worked in big sur
i can send you one
like
a link to one that works
since I have one that works
I have several
and it also does very well
well try them all
mine is like tiny
I'm eating dinner
it's also faster than the internal wifi in that hp laptop
lol
Imma try thing later
k
bye
Bye
hi I have the Big Sur installer
it didn't ask me to "update"
it asked me to "install"
so im installing
I hope that's right
yeah you install it
thats right
screenshot on macOS?
how do I take a screenshot
Command shift 3
bye
yeah thats right
why is the quailty so bad
Mac
Sc always look garbage
HA
so I was right when I told ethan
that mac screenshots are unreadable
of course, I don't talk to ethan anymore but that's a different story
Well idrk
When i send them in tg
They look absolutely awful
When i check some of the files they also look kinda bad
Cy did it work?
It's not done
Also funny
In the verbose
One of the things was
did it restart a couple of times
It's on the 3rd I think
thats when it worked for me
its name changed from installation to macos right?
thats what mine looked like
so you are on the right track
I think it's almost done
Also this time it booted into macos not installer
Ok it rebooted one more time
it should work after that
Yea thats good
Ur gonna have macos soon
Welcome
Yes I will have macos
In 7 mins
Take the time thing with a grain of salt
It's been pretty reliable for the most part
Sometimes mine says 10 minutes and takes an hour
It did break once
And told me 67 days left
Then said 4 seconds left
Then climbed back to 67 days
Then reset back to 4 seconds
Less time then it will take for graphics cards to go back in stock
Oh mines said a year once
Lol
I saw this ipad once
And it was old
And it's internal clock died
And I turned it on
And it said
Ipad is disabled
Try again in
27,469,553 days
*cough
ah
i saw someone do that with an ipod
at a science fair
i forget what they were doing
Actually first it wouldn't turn on at all
Then we put it in a freezer
For 30 mins
Then it did that
um what
very cool
Maus
ooo
i just remembered
i need to do udemy courses now
ugh
Bye
adios
also lemme know how big sur is
i may update
idk yet im still debating on it
I like big sur
My wifi works in big sur
It didn't in catalina
remember that i have an actual mac so everything pretty much works
also if i do install big sur imma do a fresh install
POG u in?
Imma play with macos bye
Yes
Thx for the help btw
have fun
np good luck
also windows is command
Yes
alt will be options
That will be fun to deal with
ctrl is ctrl
test if facetime works
Yeah imessage and facetime
Lemme do some testing
Bye
they should work
cya
Just gonna leave this here
akhil
what's ur apple id
I wanna test imessage
Porqua?
Um just use my phone number
ok what is that
Also set up like airmessage or whatever its called
Allows u to get imessages on ur phone
install xcode
I message works
and homebrew
also I should install telegram
cuz the web client
and cocoapods if u want
is
awful
uh sure
u can either use the app store or get it off of homebrew
i mean first u prob should do this
then this
then this
im doing xcode rn
so i can test ios
its like 20 gb so have fun
i also wanna install edge
im not on optimum here
well its not the speed
it downloads fast
its just a large app
its like half done
uh just get the dmg from microsoft
or homebrew it
um
how much do u have in it
Clearly much more than 768gb
obviasdkjaopsly
also my mx master 3 wont work
the bluetooth tried to connect
but just starts looping
u need the options right
and the usb never worked
since i bought the thing
um what
how
actually its a pretty cheap one i think
how do i make the usb work
its like logitech universal one
or the bluetooth
ok
press button once
then hold button once
to repair a computer on a different profile
USB mapping in the post install guide
That might help
no the ports work
the reciever doesnt
Oh
use bluetooth
switch to a different “profile”
then re-pair
tf
i have airpods now?
u have airpods?
nice
i dont tho
apple's taunting me
Lmao
connect to them
then play loud music
see where it comes from
lol
watch if its like ur galaxy buds
it wont connect to them
or the mouse
cmon even linix connected to the mouse
are u in like fancy blinking mode on the mouse?
if not then idk check like bluetooth in system info to see if things are working
no so i put it in pairing mode
it connects
then
it disconnects
then it connects
then it disconnects
ah
this
um install the logitech options software
thats what fixed it for me
yeah doing that now
thats what used to happen when i first got the mouse
cause of some apple gatekeeper restriction
also u should prob loosen the restrictions
so that u can download actual stuff
idk its been working fine
i installed edge
and options
oh then its prob fine
wait can you hear me
no
i switched the mic
DSiAble
imagine spelling
i got the mx master working
by installing the software
to put the unifying reciever in pairing mode
u dont
idk it worked this time so
also cy
please
for the love of god
auto hide the dock and menu bar
i like them
i like the icons
they look nice
really?
i hate them
a lot
they follow the right trend
nah it's good that you like them
exactly
although microsoft did a better job i think
idk
wait till you see the app indicators
wdym
like
when you get a notification
it has that red 1 on it
yes
which is really useful
and?
those r nice
windows has those
i hope you are aware
yea but the mac one is flat
also
the tray
which is nice
is not awful
since it's at the top and the icons are very nicely arranged
idk i still prefer windows
oh yea set up hot corners
macos is too
logical
its not
ergonomic
wait till you add keyboard shortcuts
this
and then
close chrome.
and then watch how long it takes to open
wdym
it doesn't close per se
it shows that it's running
but when you click open
nothing closes per se
it opens instantly
unless you cmdq then it does close
yeah i dont like how things dont close
you can cmdq if you want it to close
you have to right click
and force them too
much eaiser than alt f4
its convenient
more ergonomic
i can accidentally close like a billion tabs and reopen them
i have my ifone simulator
good
now also id try like
and some nice mac apps are around
i dont wanna use mac apps
there
that i dont have to
this one
also homebrew is really nice
try installing your dev env in macos
rn i have a problem
youll see how easy it is
which is that
i need the USB installer
to boot macos i think
lemme test
imma leave
bye
did you not install opencore on your disk
bye
no i dont think so
how do i install opencore to my disk
idk
oh cy btw
what
so on mac here is a word of advice
.txt files dont exist
lol
take it as u will
i need to figure out how to install opencore
so i dont need my installer usb in order to boot
opencore is just the EFI right?
so i just copy the EFI to the ssd
um i mean
dont u just need to like add it to grub
yes ask him
if i try and boot the ssd directly
it just
boots linix
not macos
im not dual booting tho
its an external ssd
do you still need help
yes but not now
I mean
how do I install opencore
but I cant do it now
you create a partition on your disk about 200mb formatted to exfat and call it efi. place your efi in it
that's it?
yeah its really easy
the guide makes it seem impossible
it takes a really roundabout way of doing it
ok thx
I gtg
bye
Typical washington post article:
I go to a random programming Discord server
There is a books channel.
lol
I am like "hmm"
is there also an almondmilk channel
I wonder if someone has talked about the Stormlight Archive here
And any of Brandon Sanderson's books
And the latest message
Is literally
"I've read a lot of Sanderson's books"
And like
Before that
"I recommend the Mistborn series"
This is very funny
yes
cy wants to stream video data to an ESP
No
Do it
Over RDP
lol
cy is happy with his mac install
except because he is cy
he must complain about the antialiasing
not being up to his standards
cy also likes that in 2 mins he can get VMware player to boot a physical drive
in windows
not the mac tho
that one wont work
What about
Parallels
that's for mac
why do you keep telling me to use it
also it doesn't work
cuz appleHV
"VMware 10 and Parallels 13.1.0 do support their own hypervisor, however using such outdated VM software poses a large security threat" From the guide so it is possible but may not be the best option
this was a separate comment
not macos related
I just figured out that VMware player can just boot up any external drive
in windows
Yea its a cool feature
so it means I can boot up my linix ssd
without
like
shutting down windows
i copied the EFI over
and it works now
Cool
In the post install guide you can make the boot up look pretty and also get rid of verbose mode
For the verbose just get rid of the -v argument in boot args in your plist
ok
lol
apple disabled the CPU
ah dont u love that
i need to make it not do that
i need to make it boot to the efi
if i only attach the EFI partition
...
STOP EXTREMISM
RESTRICT HIDING FACE
Cy what r u trying to do?
boot my mac drive in vmware
i need to figure out how to mount both the EFI and the macOS
I don’t think that is possible
without it defaulting to macOS
imma try anyway
Yeah if you can tell me how that’s sick
ok
nvm i figured it out
lol
ok but its not booting
just
it said to use 1 core
to avoid issues
use different image
and
mount the home dir
this is not an image
its my physical drive
from your physical
no
I would like
use a different image and mount the home dir from your physical drive
and then when you boot
you use your not home dir
you use your ESP and whatever
but try this
ramesh idk how to do this
so imma not do it
neither do I
just boot into macos
and just do everything from there
wait i gave it 12 cores
and now its being happier
lol the mac is munchin the cores
wait but y it need so many
it should need a minimum of 2
right
4 i think
wait what verson of macos
11
oo, then idk
cuz for mac mountant lion, the one u ushally hackentosh on u need min of 2
how he get macos 11
opencore
oooooo
i wanna try hackintoshing
same
seems cool
but i have a mac
i was going to build one for my mom
but she just bought a mac
sad
my Italian teacher just did not show up
2
my mac mini has 2
typical hacker news comment
this is like
percy shelley-level radicalism 

this was radical in the 1790s and it's still radical today
because
they were talking about abolishing marriage
and just saying "let's have polygamous relationships"
and tbh it might happen
Yay
if you just used osx
this wouldnt be a problem cy
because web devs
test stuff on mac os
Emacs as an IDE
it looks nice
ive been trying to get vim to kinda do that
but then i realise thats a stupid idea so i may just switch to emacs
launchnix will be having static IP support before the end of the day
Fancy
very
what is launchnix
a thing
that lets you define a file
and it turns it into a nixos vm
I thought that was what nixos was for
bye
this comment made me laugh
hi my name is React
with me, things work
first try
literally while macos was downloading
matt saw me
implement args_immutable
and I just tested them
with valid data
and it just
worked
It Just Works™
*cough'
time for my wpm to just plummet
tf is that
94% accuracy
24wpm
idk
some touch typing thing
and search
typing test
i cant touch type
i can touch type
or look type
i get like 50 with my normal way of doing it
i get 60 either way
60-80
i get like 50
never higher
and ive been meaning to learn touch typing anyway so it worked out
no akhil
bad website
you have to use the other one
do the bing one
its the best
keybr?
this one
right that one
this isnt my best
but
ramesh do the bing one
send
wdym
nvm i think i got it
also monkeytype is bad
it doesn't accept backspace
bad
wdym
also monkeytype had like
really short words
Yeah
i need to make codeools work
i said contentID instead of data.contentID
dumb
xss solved
also by default react does not permit xss
text that is rendered is rendered as text
bleachbit
no
wtf
no
it's called bleach something
meh
yeah
just bleach
one line of code
Jinja2 has unsafe you know
like
{{ html | unsafe }}
huh
if you want to do it right
you use bleach
and then
you unsafe
then there is no xss
because i cannot script you
wdym right
eg
i cant
send you a challenge
with a script on the page
ah
okay
it cleanses
like
it determines what gets displayed and what doesnt
idk i have to test it
yeah
lemme see hold on
perhaps jinja2 has something of this sort as well
ok but im not using jinja
for this
yeah
im just thinking and stuff
ok
where is the "malware" folder located
for Microsoft edge
i need to delete some malware
lol
companies shouldn't go public
?
u mean like on the stock market?
or like open source
stock market
hey cy
wanna switch to imessage
no
i bricked msedge
ill make a gc
I mean it gets money
and add u and akhli
ramesh
i cant use it on my phone
u can
airmessage
also you have an ipod touch
lol
no
airmessage works
well
with LTE right
and that is not like
you can port forward airmessage
I also did that
expanding
it worked well
my ipod touch is expanding
its getting bigger
and the screen
is increasingly getting
more and more purple
and pink
and green
Um
cygh
and rainbows
just
upgrade it
iphone 12 is out
Or trade it in if it will get u any moneys
its quite funny because that ipod touch is so thin
that like
if the battery swells
it bends the screen
a lot
like
if you press on the screen
you get a ripple in the LCD
in the shape of an iPod battery
yeah get an ipod touch
no
iphone 12
sorry
cy
how many wifi issues have you had with your samsung
like 1
recently
and not many more
well other than the fact that like
i have a conspiracy that like
AT&T
are like
messing with my auto switching cellular settings
to make my dad pay more moneys
Um
Dont get AT&T then
lol
Get unlocked
tell my parents that
This
i made a bad decision
ok
ok its fine
This
its
… fine
*sad
Global phones are good
i would have gotten the unlocked
its a long story
and it gives me a headache
and makes me sad
so we will not discuss
Especially when providers add like malware in ur phones
When it boots up
mine is mostly fine
i just get software updates like a month late
and dont get betas
and i wont be able to rom flash later
U should
I regret my decisions
Cause i cant jailbreak now
Its not the worst but it’s annoying as heck
i want a pixel
Pickles are good
they are
i like pickles
no
get an iphone
pixels suck
their hardware is awful
their hardware is good
google and apple manage to make good hardware
samsung is ok
but the software tho
on google
is just
better
than on samsung
samsung is a hot pile of tar
literally
it gets
hot
i dont like any phones
apple
does not
have USB-C
also apple's jailbreak ecosystem is better
the UI is better
imessage is undeniably better
imessage is for ignorant americans
well
iGnorant
good luck trying to
Yes
communicate with anyone
congratulations, you have just blocked the entire gender of "female" as ignorant
Its more like community
cy thats misogynistic
you cant say that
librals are going to cancel you now
liberals are going to cancel me
yes
because you are anti apple
and thus
anti women
*sigh
you are calling women
ignorant
iGnorant
for choosing imessage
no ignorant
which is MISOGYNISTIC AND SEXIST GET CANCELLED
CANCEL HIM
this works
unfortunately
tbh
<code> doesnt
i am getting angry
at what
the world
lol
i need to figure out how to enable <code>
what is wrong with this conclusion
ramesh
its not just women
it's mostly women
although yes it is men it's also more women than men
switch this
no that's not what i want
and you would probably get
the imessage one
yes
also
this
this just confuses me
is this telling me
that women are not interested in sexual relationships?
like
gee thanks
thats useful
yeah it is
the ereader one
lol
is interesting
when they talked about men being raped they were saying that "oh men don't mind getting raped by women since they're always lustful for sex" but like if women are also like human by nature then why aren't they too "lustful for sex"
yeah
what did I say
ur not helping ur case cy
more women than men use ios
lol
does that mean more women are liberals than men
idk
but that's not important in this context I think
i think more women are liberals than men though
my data points:
women that decide that it's a good idea to put their "pronoun" or whatever
yes
that seems to align well with this
i also agree with the republicans on the surveillance stuff
many of them feel like big tech is spying and whatnot
my dad is a centrist
but there is no place for such people in the US
you either vote democrat
or republican
or you vote
centrist
like that third party with like
3 people
COVID cases found in New Zealand: 63
im still
people found in New Zealand: 143
lol
this
do women not have sexuality or something
ill let you ponder that
whilst i work on codetools
I mean
it makes me wonder stuff
…
github doesn't minify their stuff
nvm
not ALL of it
besides like rails auto minifies anyway
so
flex
Hold on
flexing flex i see
flexx
14.4.1 just got released
I may get jailbreaks

Ah of course
i mean if you want storage
for free
you also get like email
and a buncha other things
i have an account
i forget what ti's called tho
i could probably find it
i need reliable storage
with good integration
with my phone
google photos is the only option
Aws?
other than just having enough space
Ah never mind
That cant happen
yes it can
google photos
Get like gsuite
U prob get free storage
google photos is the most seamless thing

doesnt work on safari kinda
u see
if i press escape
the browser goes from full to minimized
lol
i need to test on macos
also it currently doesn't work in Samsung Internet or Safari mobile
idk why
i dont like
idk
no it's good but
you need to add
larger pills
Make the center bigger
why
this is a desktop
I want to utilize all the space
idk i think they get too big when they are larger
rn they are 64px
i mean send a screenshot
maybe theyre really small for you
and not for me
no with the browser bars and all that
this should be
what it is
no thats too big
its supposed to be
or whatever
and so they are small
this is nice
open it in chrome
i have not patched in firefox support yet
still too small in chrome
no they will be the same size
this is
but there will be blur
idc about blur
how
zoom
mines tiny as heck
i uploaded a new version
is what i see
Lol u test iexplore
iexplore
what is
iexplore
oh that
yes
i do
it doesn't work
I've noticed that some images make my website slow down
they make it choppy
and low fps
make em all svg
but if i take them away and replace them
hello world in my language
it becomes smooth again
is this kinda like lisp, cause it reminds me with the tree like thing
not really like lisp
lisp is like
lisp loves parentheses
huh
hi my name is firefox
i manage to crash your 5 lines of js
hi my name is js
hi dont use js
and not tell you where
the error is
how to make anyone feel bad easily
"you should be ashamed of yourself"
how to be firefox
die upon content load
its like
follow them, thanks
my website is dying in firefox
setting the hash of the location in firefox
causes the element to lose focus
s t o p     m e s s i n g     w i t h     m y     f o c u s
you know
who
writes the standards right
google
ok, so then follow them
no
i dont care
who writes them
it is not easy to follow them
follow them
when the only thing that implements it is chrome
that's called vendor lock in
ie6 did this
its not my job to have to deal with this crap
or you
write your software for firefox
and then it will work in chrome
no it wont
as I do
neither of them follow the standards
they just have to like
change
things
why
why
why
why
why
why
asdlfaj;sdlfkja;sldkfja;slkdfj
use safari
TF IS THIS
Ha
lol
why
safari is mostly ok
but the esc thing doesn't work
as well as some other things
whats the link
i need to test
here lemme upload the latest version
..
why
wait
the blur thing
it's not great but it works
also it's uploading
wdym
this even works in webkit
the blur
what browser is that
gnome web
it uses
and why dont the border radii work
webkit
open it in firefox
and be amazed
at how it fails
to work
welll
it used to work
i added js for reliable hashes
so the hash does good stuff
rather than work sometimes
and not other times
but the consequence of this
is that firefox decides not to work
hmm
IE and Samsung Internet are having the same issues
imma for the first time actually try and make my layout work in IE
Why?
then maybe itll work in samsung internet
Not many people use internet explorer anymore
yeah but you see
its replicating the issue im having in samsung internet
and since it has devtools
and samsung internet doesnt
...
Fine then u can
I dislike IE alot
i thought samsung internet
used chrome
blink
Its so slow
it does
but for some reason
certain things are different
its not exactly blink
its a modified version
I get uncomfortable writing about anything with the word "sex" in it
so I have to fix that
by
writing about things with the word "sex" in it
ok ramesh
you do you
"social commentary"
No he has a kinda point
our society
This was very apparent in english class
taboos sex
and says
that you cannot talk about it
you cannot talk about sexual stuff and you cannot be open about anything
Well idk about that
your inner feelings about sex
etc
so
But catcher through the rye
yeah that one was very good with this
like when he goes to the bar
in the hotel
and starts dancing with the girl
No one wanted to talk about it
or whatever
we did it in a google doc last year
so
Same
do you know what the actual like
restrictions are
when you get put on the sex offender list
since I forget
Ur on a public list
what else
And u cant be near schools i believe
do you remember anything else
Nada
not sure if I want to look it up
Dont
I remember there is an offender on allen
huh
but like
are you allowed to go to the grocery store
if you are a sex offender
Of course
why
what if I go to the grocery store
and do sexual crimes
Well depends if u got jail time
Cause if ur in jail
U cant
true
do they always go to jail tho
Depends on charges
ok
good
i need this for my story
Um
gracias
this means yes or no
Im honestly not entirely sure
But go with yes
no it's not a question lol
but
whatever
hi Samsung Internet is LITERALLY chrome
i can use
the chrome
USB inspection tools
to inspect element
on a remote device
in samsung internet
The wors fancy gives me PTSD for no reason
"WARNING" THIS PACKAGE CONTAINS A BAG OF "DESSICANT"
what
oh
what did you buy with silica gel in it
Asian stuff
also are you going to school mp4
rice crackers
probably
ok
I am probably as well
so I will likely see you there
yes
thereby
being able to
I thought I had to stop doing that
but you wont be able to come to apcs
who said I can't
of course I will
i see
if I can
I mean
how do irl study halls work
i need make my site work on samsung internet
and firefox
can you go do whatever you want in irl study hall
idk
or is it like
i dont have study hall
normal school
oh
what aobut lunch
lunch you come into the cafeteria
and then
and they take attendance
and then
and you sit
but do I have to sit
or if I have a pass
can I go somewhere else
idk if you ask them to go somewhere
and you have a reason
ok i have to ask mrs tan
"i usually help the apcs class period 5"
hopefully we can come to some arrangement
where i can skip lunch
"lunch"
yeah
"lunch"
more like dreary study hall
7:35
yes
"lunch"
i was like
what could be worse than period 4 lunch
period 5 lunch is good if you're online
since you can sleep
yes
but
not if you go to school
and that is fine
someone tell me why my selector works in chrome
but not chrome
because samsung chrome is not glossy enough
its like
in regular chrome
ok
so hold on
so lemme send 2 screenshots
edge debugging edge
edge debugging samsung internet
remind me to install a spellchecker for emacs
that is not an issue tho
what is an issue
is this
:
this selector
why
doesn't work in samsung internet
is there a random
angle bracket
add a space
no bad
like
i mean
i can try
try
the autoformatter automatically removes it
make sure it doesn't
lemme save without formatting
also my emacs autoformatter
doesn't do that
lol no
that didn't fix it
also i have lots of other operators
without spaces
I can write 20 paragraphs
but none of them
are for school
This is why I'm not afraid of writing school paragraphs
i sorta fixed my issue
it was with the :not
but now i dont have the :not
*yawn
you know if one browser changed itself to work like another
it would not cause a problem
cuz web designers are forced to make things work in all browsers
so websites would still work
what if
web browsers weren't so complex
or
no
or we stopped using websites
let's make another compiled cross-platform gui standard that doesn't require a renderer like this
that would like have the same problems
lol
there are frameworks that will automatically fix this stuff I think
FYI
ah yes
cy wrote this
gee scrollbars are great
when you can actually move them
up and down
then why tf cant i click it
and scroll it

why

do you really have 35 layers of content
hi ramesh
also this is like basic
you do like
10 PRINT
and not 1 PRINT
because what if you need to insert something
between 1 and 2
you cant
but you can between
10 and 20
I melped my story
idk why it's called isit2.pdf

did you invest in roblox
Roblox has stonks?
Whats the symbol
RBLX
idk
if you had invested 70000 shares this morning
you would be GODDAMN rich
probably a millionaire
How much was it?
idk it went public today
ah thats why idk about it
u invest in the morning
get rich fast
and sell off
um so
that has to be a crime
day trading?
yes
should I be like "can we get an F for this dead chat"
i never even use imessage
this hasnt been active since like
january
ok no im an attention seeker
bad
no
not doing that
I saw an article that it went public but thought it was a joke
michael
smhhh
Did it actually go publoc
Publoc
yyes
it is
at 65 dollars rn
Whatttt
u should have invested
u would have made it
tf
I saw the article like 2 days ago
well it went public today
thats pretty good
Bruhhh
like really good
well
why
invest now
did
it
go so high so fast?
idk if it will go higher tho
Gamestop?
no roblox
or gamestop
HOLD
GME
arent they trying to pump gme again?
Like reditt ppl keep pushing it like gme
yea
i saw it on wsb
its prob not gonna work
i hope it does
Cuz roblox a joke
some people are gonna get rich
Yuh
i would invest
when it gets higher just dump it
Gamestop will make money
if they are pumping it on reddit ofc
Yea I think I might
as long as there are not enough shares to go around
because thats the problem rn
uh
what
is that how it works
are there a finite number of shares
ofc
i was not under the impression that was how it worked
there is finite amount of shares
thats how it gets value
like money
… oh
i need to learn about the stonk market
its nice to know about it
maybe I should add more spanish posts
Task:
Get code from macos to windows
Problem:
NTFS
macos wont write to ntfs
windows cant read apfs
Solution: 

Paragon NTFS driver
solution:
use a flash drive
problem:
solution: exFAT
flash drive is a bootable installer
solution:
store code in the EFI partition
problem solved ✔
cy tested his code in safari
it now works
cy
he cant stand macos tho
cuz the antialiasing
is
so
you know
bad
this exists right
get the trial
ramesh
i have
twelve thousand seven hundred
bytes
of code
i need to get them
from macos
to windows
in 1 minute
solution:
cycloud
solution
grab a flash drive
sneakernet
ok
and copy the code to the EFI partition
lol yes
but
no
or else
simple
I wish all websites were like this
and then
so I am now a hypocrite
why
border-radius
is good
yes
but then
I proceed
to be inconsistent
since im too lazy to figure out scss imports
its just
bad
its not
good
I think it is good
because
of how little effort seems like it was put in
nah you could put in a little more thought
and the same effort
and get a much nicer result
idk
do you think
rameshCSS is viable
wdym
like
i could make a library
called ramesh.css
like water.css but ramesh.css
do you get it
idk frankly for what i do
i just need something that like
makes the body have 0px margin
deals with collapsing margins
makes the background black
i have
and makes the text
reset.css
and then I override everything else manually
inter or DM
and then makes the text white
and adds hoverfancy
and rounded buttons
and stuff
so i have basicstyle.css
I have some scss files
scss is wonderful
you have to compile it tho
and i dont wanna
compile
my css
webpack
i could write some
for other things
meh
the nesting
is what gets me
plus the comments
now less bad
i see
i wanna make a blog
you can add all these optimizations
with Gastsby
or whatever
one of those fancy ones
once you get your basic styling
but with SEO
Jekyll?
hugo is another one
but like
if i
make a new page
and just
Gatsby build
then push to github
i build
i push
netlify just updates
netlify is what I use too
so i dont need any of that xtra fancy stuff
nokogiri keeps having random segmentation faults
i could use a CMS
but i want that SEO
and HTML
that is good
I use my own ssg
but you all know that
ive said this like 200 times
yes
you have
ideally you see i want a system
that like
does all this more autonomously
How long did it take?
see you could use like
an object storage thing
no
idk i can try gatsby
for a blog
or something
idk how to do all of it tho
um
i think a day
but i spent a few hours one night writing the markup language
dont write a markup language
lol
Idk i would stick with markdown
If i were to make a blog
But i dont have plans for it
i want a system
where
i can focus
on the appearance and the content
not on the system
i need to look into this more
in fact i now know what i want
a blog that's partially static, and partially dynamic
like
the homepage
would be dynamic
to allow for fancy infinite scrolling
and whatever
but
the actual posts
would be
static
for SEO and speed and consistency
i wrote somethingl ike this
where it had authentication behind a static site
what do you think
that's stupid
app
🈸
that is the substitute emoji
for app
Cy
do you want to read that story
this
*sigh
no nrn
ok
i need to do things

hi my name is
OVH cloud
and my data center burned down
I was talking about this with JP yesterday
lol
whats the deal then
do ppl like
just lose all their data
no they had backups I think
so SBG or whatever is back up
all their recent data
no I think even that
how is that backed up tho
th is this
it just like
"added" me
im reporting spam
nice one
i got like a 79
I have not gotten a C on a science test ever
not as far as i can remember
neither have I
but ive had a couple this year so
this is unheard of
eh
my grade is always fine
they never do much
i am emailing him
the technical failures of the test were not taken into account
um
yes i spent time reading my notes
what failures?
but i also spent time
decoding latex
on every
other
question
that was only one question i think?
everything else was fine
i had many
from what i remember
huh
i mean decoding latex wasnt that hard
ok but it takes time
and its very error prone
well u can ask him ig
i dont think they will do anything about it
it needs to be brought up
this is not acceptable.
i mean our teacher brought it up, but he said things happened
dr p did not mention once today
when talking about that test
the technical issues
Me when I fail a calc test instead of getting the standard A+

I am not going to click on it
Until telegram loads some preview up
lol
i wanna know the right kind of database
for each application
and how to use them
also i wanna see if i can replace mongodb in codetools for the code
to something else
that would hopefully eliminate the need for a 1000 character limit
or whatever
so like
code is stored in a cheaper way
that is not mongodb
Make ur own
then theres graph databases
a;sdlkfj;alskdjf too many databases
Launchnix should have feature parity now
this is why i hate sass already
i get some code from github
for a Gatsby site
and the whole thing works
except
now
it can fail to compile
which it does
and renders my site inoperable
it just adds more points of complexity and failure
do you want to write the same kode 40 times
Ah wait
evil mode
the other way around
also for the love of god dont use emacs keybinds
unless you like
actively want rsi
I wont
This is looks pretty good
Ill try it over the weekend
you should install emacs
Hmm
I may
Gui emacs
gccemacs
is like
fast
ok so some malicious activity
somehow Unigram has downloaded like
large
quantities
of
age inappropriate content
to my computer
it must have auto downloaded from one of those spam invites
idk
remember
yes the spam invite
cant you like
prevent people from putting you in rooms
meh it doesn't happen often enough to be a problem
im just minorly concerned that like
illegal
content
someone is gonna see this stuff
will end up on your computer
i should delete it
yes
you should
but it would delete my cache
Yes
of other stuff
no just
delete it
it doesn't matter
ok
it's not worth the risk
This
im done with my work
Also isnt there a setting
what shall i work on
To stop telegram auto downloading stuff
here
Tf is this
Looks like a scene from an indian movie ngl
telegram
piracy is a thing
ok i deleted all that
then i realized
after it was all gone
that i forgot to hit shift+delete
recycling bin
so i pressed ctrl+z
Just empty the trash
and it all came back
lol
then i did shift+delete
does linix or mac have undo in the file manager
Yea
lol npm is having a fun time
I can just mass exodus my trash bin
then i realized
this is just the videos folder
theres also a photos folder
i did not look in there
i do not want to see
Just delete the folder itself
also its like
thousands of files
Well have fun
im not deleting them
they are fine
Um no
oo npm is done
Its better to just delete them
please
yes
delete them
also read white is black
that took so long i finished a whole homework assignment and forgot what i was even doing
npm in wsl
is slow
as
hell
boot into macos
and watch
how it is actually usable
unlike windows garbage
rn its just broken
cy
just
please
just
try macos
just try it please
that takes effort
it's unix
also it wont work
it will not have these problems
why
I mean its not much effort
i thought you spent a day
an afternoon
Multiple afternoons
just try
booting into macos
and doing this
just
try it
macos is really annoying
it clears my nvram
just try it
yeah other than that
and then i cant use windows hibernate
it just kills windows nvram
look
try using npm specifically
the same thing is happening on wsl and windows
its telling me
just try macos
it wont have fs issues
its not an fs issue
Change its perms
also it will be faster
i can switch back to windows now
i know this is not a windows issue
try macos for web dev
npm i
also it will stop complaining about fseventsd
since thats mac only
since all web devs use mac
mac bad
mac proprietary
and the most
no
XNU is open source
un-open
it is actually open
the API is open
it takes
it's more open than windows at least
an afternoon
to install
you think
its not to be relied on
windows would be easy
under any circumstances
if it were just for
surfaces
i can actually install windows
and rely on the fact
that it will be there
when i need it
*cough
macos to me is some experimental toy
its cool and fun
Idk bout u but macos has been pretty reliable
but
not good
its not dependable
i cannot trust it will be there
if somehow my support stops working
or something goes wrong
i musnt lose my ability to develop
windows and linix will always be there
linux is junk
I think you have said something like this before
use macos
i dont have to worry about dictator apple
telling me
apple is good
im not worthy
linux is bad
then use macos
you havent experienced
the
you can go do that
no
i dont practice what I preach
lol hypocrite
you see with me
its about long term
ok it works today
huh
but that means nothing for something like this
it always needs to work
also the antialiasing in macos
there i fixed it
more proof
gives me a headache
I hate the cupertino font
ik its a movie quote
wdym?
macos has terrible antialiasing
it's also awful in linux
it makes my eyes hurt
if you somehow
enable segoe UI
as your main font
dont install segoe UI on lunix
it ends badly
windows is good in many ways
u have to play with ur fontconfig to replace Segoe UI
like antialiasing
i mean u can turn off some of the annoying stuff
look
i never said I liked macos
font smoothing is not bueno on some monitors
windows "just works" when it comes to monitors
and fonts
and antialiasing
like
you dont appreciate it
until
linux is
you try something else
mac does as well
also a
"it just works"
its something universal
just dont use awesomewm
use like GNOME
with GNOME literally everything works
although i have to say
it's basically the de facto linux DE at this point
on linux it works too
its just mac
that doesn't work
yes
because it's a hackintosh
no that's not why
why am I even defending this
im surprised to see this as well
i know what is "because its a hackintosh"
ur holding it wrong
dont use a surface on linux
and then yell at linux for it not working
lol that's old
i have used linux much more
since then
on other devices
and for other purposes
that was just a fun project
that failed
i usually get the feeling that cy really dislikes linux
like desktop linux
im not saying
no he doesn't
server linux
or wsl
desktop linux is fine
but
it doesn't suit my needs
windows is adware
macos is kiddie icons
lol you call it adware cuz like
linux is good
they install
candy crush
yes
adware
i fckin hate those icons
that was annoying
i like the icons
that meme is good
the
i never open the start menu
so i never see them
one with the5 year old on macos
ik they look like absolute garbage
Jetbrains mono is growing on me
the icons on macos are really nice
i like them
also certain things are nicer
but
like
they are unnecesary
maximize minimize
is like
not really a thing
l/r snapping
?
like
on windows
i can run the window into the left of the screen
yeah
win left
yea
i do it as well
and it snaps to half the screen
how else do i do apush notes
win left win right is a thing on kde too
no
but you have to use a mouse
on macos
oh and then they have the windows key
and you have to hold a traffic light
the command key
as the control key
which is called
command
and has a symbol
i mean its not the worst
that is impossible to remember
no
it's slow
not hard to remember
also its less ergonomic
u never use the control or option keys thats just what it is
that is true
also on my hackintosh
scrolling is
broken
apple hates scroll bars
there were other things
like
the dock
is nice
until
you want to maximize
then its really ugly
or its hidden
neither of which is optimal
and then there are 2 bars
one on the bottom
?
and one on the top
and the one on the top is bad
cuz like
if i have 2 screens
this happened yesterday
and the app on the left screen is focused
then the top bar
will have the options
for that window
on both screens
so then i go to the other screen
and i forget
that that window is in focus
and not the one on the right screen
and i do options
on the left window
what?
the bar on the top
with edit
and window
and go
and apple
and whatever
on dual screens
it breaks
cuz
i have 2 windows in my focus
but one of them takes the controls
on both screens
also apps cant span 2 screens
I like jetbrains mono
did I say this
on windows i can put an app between 2 screens
that is like
the one good macos feature
unity had it too
what
i never clicked on the second monitor
idk for me that didn't work
also i dont like how i cant put a window between screens
like i can on windows
why would u want to is the question?
i want this
because
if i have 2 full screen windows
and 1 other window
and i dont want to lose it behind the others
i can put it between screens
then click to the first screen
click back to the window when im done
between monitors
then click back to the other fullscreen window
or
sometiems
certain content doesn't matter
or can be cut off
then i can more efficiently use space
on my screens
kotlin
I just click my mouse and all my screens show up
should I make my font this big
i feel like im old if I do this
Make it resonable
also cy did you ever implement WSJrunner5
that's a goal of mine
panos i want my rounded corners
panos im waiting for my rounded corners
im getting those tomorrow
switching to awesomewm
playtools
playtools
i just said
lol
you should advertise your product rn
no ive wasted enough time already
where do babies come from?
So
essentially
i will spare you
all these babies live in an alternate universe
it was a question
and what happens is
on the playposit
ms tan will answer it
dont worry
ah okay
cy likes coffee
it tastes good
i thought cy wasnt allowed to coffee
no they said when i turn 16 i can drink coffee
i am 16
you can take them home
yes
yes
i have
453 ducks
i have 457 ducks
it's 3
right
i think its 3
but ive seen different numbers
some have like 200
it's 458
cy was closer
nah find the original meme
i cant find it
i dont think he originally said it
he didnt
but the meme was on reddit
Jamstack
i dislike jam
nutella is nicer
true
the web for frontend developers
that wanna call themselves
"full stack"
i mean
that just means u do both
yes
shuí
front and backend
I really need to push my dots
yeah but with jamstack there is very little backend
its all high level stuff
usually
i need to code along with her here
bye
or
what is the direct translation of you're welcome
in spanish
in French its
"of nothing"
ah so similar to the english “its nothing”
another way of saying ur welcome
yeah
dont girl
smh
Hey its a wild cy
i have to email mr. whalin about a random form
this feels uncomfortable
does cy have any ideas
um
what random form
NHS forms
?
it's due at 2:25
idk if they will be fast enough
but theres a chance
national honors society
Do it
im trying
Cause
im trying
what do you have to tell him
to sign the NHS form
i dont exactly know what nhs is
but
it's like a form
and it asks
about other activities you have done
and it wants a signature
ok one moment
ill write an honest email
Yes
Hi Mr. Whalin,
I haven't seen you in a long time.
How's it going?
I talked to him in the summer once
he wanted help with his Ubuntu computer
For the National Honors Society, I have to say all the things I did outside of school.
So, since I participated in the iPad Club, I would like you to sign this form to say that i participated.
I hope you and Bert are doing well
and staying safe from the coronavirus
Thanks a lot,
Ramesh
✔email written
Who is Mr. Whalin?
the volunteering guy
he was pretty interesting
Ah i see
Apparently Samsung is promising better android updates than google
3 generations
Um
on S, Z, Note, A, and M phones
Thats kinda short
Wait no
Thats longer
it's due at 2:25
and 4 generations of security patches
do you think he will respond before 2:25
My j3 has no support after 4 months
idk
Probably
Mabye
Send with like an urgent tag or something
no this is starting recently
j3 is like
old
and its a J
Ik im saying
3 generations is long for a samsung i think
yes
the thing is tho
Its still nothing compared to ios tho
android updates are not like
ios updates
the system apps are updated separately
most of them
and especially with google mainline
where
core components of android
Ios does this i think
Some apps are
are not actually part of android anymore
they are managed by Google Play Services
so they can be updated
without consent
or input
from the manufacturer
or carrier
thats problematic
no it means
longer support
and faster updates
also like
old android versions are not that bad
like
i have a galaxy s4
with android 5
but like
most things just work
perfectly fine
and all the google apps are all up to date
Hi Mr. and Mrs. Whalin,

I haven't talked all of you in a long time, and perhaps I should be better about that—I hope you are all doing okay. I know our pandemic has been tough on everyone, but I hope it is getting better. I still remember our volunteering experiences and I hope with our vaccines supply increasing that one day in the near future we will be able to come back to the Fellowship Village. I do miss coming on Saturdays. I know that I definitely will return if I'm still in school when everything gets better.

To my main subject, my school—for the National Honors Society—is once again asking for my experiences outside of school, and they want more signatures. Unfortunately, I think this is due at 2:25 PM today, so it would be greatly helpful if you could sign this attached document (it also asks for the number of hours I volunteered, and my estimate may not be perfectly accurate, but I don't think it's an overestimate). However, if signing this form is not possible, that is totally, completely, and perfectly okay—the National Honors Society forms aren't mandatory at all, and I should have most definitely started working on these things this earlier, so it's really my fault for not e-mailing you earlier.

Again, I hope you all are doing okay. Stay safe. If you need help with your computers, you can still ask me (:

Thanks a lot,
Ramesh
That’s nice
I think this is okay
Yes
Very good
totally, completely, and perfectly okay—the National Honors Society forms aren't mandatory at all
i would like
make this more concise
thats totally fine—the National Honors Society forms aren't mandatory at all
I am once again
asking for your financial support
lol
Memes are great
I sent it
Forgetting to ask for the phone number
Idk it isnt concise but it does convey how its not important
Nice one
it's fine
I think I have it
Well we shall see if u get them in time
I gave him a few hours
like 4
so I think I can get this
Probably
resume
Depends if he checks his email
cuz they want that
does Mr. Whalin check his email
I think he checks it
listen from 3:30
i like that part
Cy do you think I volunteered for 60 hours
probably
i mean
52 weeks in a year
2 hours per week
not all weeks tho
before koronavirus
i skip some
if you were doing it for 2 years
that would be
208 hours
max
so a little less
like 60% of that
so 124h
Tbh I probably
underestimated like crazy
dont underestimate yourself
I remember them saying that I could make up my volunteering hours and they would still sign it because of the amount of help I gave them
idk if he was joking
or not
lol
I mean tbh
they probably would've
lol
they did seem pretty thankful to have me there
they were
like
i am
going to go back there
when everything opens again
at the end of 2021
I see
i wanna index the internet
Like google?
we already talked about this
Did we?
lol yes
but if you forgot
yes
I forget everything after like 3 months
like google
twitter
i need an efficient, multithreaded system
oatmilk
almondmilk
yes
oatmilk is a bit weird
its like
milk with pulp
like theres orange juice with pulp
oatmilk is milk with pulp
what if i used redis
for speeeeed
the thing is I need a tree
i recommend bonsai
i need something fast
aspens grow pretty fast ive heard
i mean i could use bamboo
its not much of a tree tho
u could
yea
hmm
a relational search index
hmm
so wait
so
if i had a key-list pair
didnt u make like a python thing do this
i did but
um
and u scraped like twitter
well the thing is
i need an actual db
so i dont index each thing 5 times
then ideally
i can get something with enough performance
that like
i can run it at 1gbps
i could run it on the 4h server
see all i want rn
is a list of URLs
then i can add indexable data to them later
like google hmm
see how like bing and google do their stuff
well google also has a cache of the content
that it can index
but i dont have enough space for that rn
also i can do that easily later
see ideally i have some database
that lets this work well
the problem with redis
is its RAM
so no
no not that
download some ram
that would take up bandwidth
from my indexer
ahh true
idk
so the question is
i need to create a financial network
which is gonna kill me
what db is fast
i need to store
idk sqlite?
this
i need to store
key: url, list of keys
but i need it searchable by url
so i can search does this url exist
no this wont work
i need to do url:list pairs
i could use Mongo
but no
probably not
the thing about mongo tho
is like
its just a JSON
cyrch
postgresql?
idk
should I update my omega installation
yes
idk
but it will
delete my history
lol mine ran out of charge
and it like
erased its history
um i think mine kept its history if i did it from source
webUSB
webSocket
webRTC
webAssembly
cy
can you find mr whalin's phone number
i think i have it
but I want to make sure
um
like check your call logs or something
ok
i mean
tell me the number
i can search by it
ok
um
no actually
i dont
have any thing
idk where the history is
actually
ok
so do you think it is this
text it
only one way to find out
idiot
yes
ok
ah i should self host bitwarden
bitwarden_rs
also I need to add this feature for static IPs in launchnix
to choose ur interface
please yes
also imma get back into setting up kubernetes
fix your
i wont stop till it works this time
which it will
you should try nixos
i could
nixos was really easy to set up bridges and stuff
yeah im going to let you choose a static ip on ur bridge
v
look at my cool status
very cool status
should i do my thing in r or c?
what thing
a ripoff bloomberg terminal
um
idk what that is
c is more useful
to know
i think
this thing
cause i dont feel like spending
24000 a year
i use templating in a text file
since im ramesh
i tested mongodb
it inserted documents at
4.5k documents per second
i doubt my indexer will need more than that
now time to relate all these documents to each other
imma make 100k doucments
and then
make them all related
so then it has to trace through them
I added custom static IP interface support
that was very easy
im doing 100k search read relations
so it searches by id
then finds the relationship
then searches that
then finds that relationship
then keeps searching
i think tho
im in an infinite loop
I added custom interface support for launchnix
Nice
Nice
Making a stock market api is a lot harder than i thought
Linux Is Not UniX
its Mrs Harding
Am I basically a TA for APCS
is this
does this qualify
no it doesn't qualify
you spend all the time like
discussing APUSH
with Aryan
Lmao seriously
also TAs do like
grading
and stuff
and follow teacher orders
I agree
but sometimes
my mom has TAs
that grade things
for her
exactly
the problem
is that no one needs help
So your mom has a lot of power then
and then sometimes they need help
no not really
Like what super Mario bros was coded with
lmao
no like the other day
people were asking me questions about their airplane lab
they could also ask me questions
they could
would that make me a TA
but
you are taking the class
am I "taking" the class
true
So Ramesh is like a partial TA
so what do I put on this junk NHS resume
20% TA
Lmao
humour
Yes I agree
Well
TA is like an actual job
20% TA
Ah didnt see that
Well then he is like a partial slave
hes not a slave tho
cuz he can just
leave
i can
or discuss
He is technically doing work but not getting paired
APUSH
look
i tried to leave
if you didnt notice
i just left in the middle of their apush conversation
and no one wanted help so I just came back
Isnt that what interns are?
no
Yes but some of them get paid
ramesh
is
neither an intern
nor a
TA
what is cool about it
Then use ohm's law to find the vdrop over the wire
Then the tab auto closes
20% slave
What?
lol double e
ee
idk i think its just
im thinking out loud
so akhil doesn't know it
i have 2 more classes to do for school
No yea you have to pay and use a Mac for anything related to iOS development
My dad said we can take them
cinnamon spice black
well after i enabled integrated graphics in the bios
and embedded systems
batter life
and now
you see i dont like milk
idk
also I found why my printer leaks
welcome to coding with cy
and do other things
Bonne nuit
Wait what was the point of the photo
because the new player's positions will be much lower
ok
here ima rewrite the computers one
and how much did you pay for
and miracast
This is fun
yes
cy is updating windows atm 
then hes 
gonna go to best buy 
and buy RAM 
> and eat it 
yes
I haveth been summoneth
cuz they are random
and that is not optimal
I summoneth the Akhileth
Cyrus Westbrookkus
Wait
because it sees that too many false edits have been made from that locaiton
the lighting is good tho
Yeah that top bat
but it's a .tv domain
hold on lemme get a diagram
Yup
Why hasn’t Akhil been summoned. This should have worked
Im here
Oh nvm
Haha
no
no stop
my fingers hurt so much
after doing that
Control C control V
thats the same amount of keys
Tru
/ space s enter
should I
But much easier to spam
add my precalc experience to this nhs resume
like
i stopped failing math
look at me im cool
Pre calc experience...th
Wdym experience
like
becoming a better student
a more diligent and studious student
and had success
U just took a class
Yeah
ok
Put some extra curricular s on the application
Or put links to all of your websites
put any instruments you play, u dont have to be the best at it
im done with this
Imagine playing an instrument....I wish I did
I mean i will be able to say i made 3 apps for people
Mr Y
Ms Tan
4H
Tru
and i plan on doing something for my mom
also
i will have lots of testimonials
from all the people
including Akash
at some point
akash told me he would give my testimonial after i helped him
with web dev
I did
When was this
When did I sign the contract
idk
yes
I require proof of signature
but u did at some point
What
but did he sign on it?
i need to identify
how to
Yea I prob did
use mongodb
Y
so i can index the internet
Again? Why?
um
i wanna
index
the innernet
But
Why
how should i know
Are u making a search engine or soemthibg
yeah
i can make a search engine
but its more about the data
i want the data
Yep this is just a classic Cy moment
i had to like
 run ethernet through the walls
 to get to the furnace room
 but like coincidentally
 the router is right on the other side of the wall
 and coincidentally
 there is a hole
 in the wall
 just big enough for 2 ethernet cables
 so i ran
 the 2 ethernet cables
 and now
 it is on ethernet
Which is better to learn for applications, C# or C++
c# for unity and windows
C++ for everything else
Time to learn c++
have fun
printf("%d", 3)
malloc
&var
i like some of the things you can do in c
types are not really a thing
so like
a character
is an int
is an array
is whatever
like literally
you can like
declare variables
by like
telling the computer
to allocate memory
and it allocates memory
then returns a pointer
so if i want a char array for example
i could say
for an array of 10 chars
Idk i need some way to make desktop applications
no
not this
not c
use some cross platform thing
dare i say electron
Mabye
I might do rust and elm
I need to first get le data
i dont need to make desktop apps
i make websites
they do all
no prob
and they are cross platform by design
best cad for linux:
onshape
since it actually runs
cuz its web
Idk i think having a ticker app is better if its a app then a website
what is a ticker
Stock market tickers
Like symbols, charts graphs reports
All them stuff
i see
Earnings
PWAs are a thing
They are
i see decreasing need for desktop apps
from a development standpoint
i like them but like
web is just
so much easier
to deal with
the other thing is like
good luck with display scaling
about 50% of windows apps
fail to scale properly
to hi res screens
and they are slow
and buggy
and they often take up extra resources
that a browser has already allocated
well fck it
mabye ill try next.js
why not gatsby
i dont think this is gonna be a static website
because it would always be changing
by the minute
but i think Gatsby and next.js serve the same purpose
to build static sites
for jamstack
they are not "static"
they are just
client side rendered
doesnt next has server side rendering
it might
idk
gatsby is client, next is server
dont listen to me
do something
Yeaaaa
Their pumpin it again
it's going up again i think
I can invest in it cuz I won't b able to short sell ot
It
Again?
Really
Yup
Damn
go look on yahoo finance
I made bloomberg terminal
this is one monitor
*claps
no no no
michael do you take italian
michaels gone
That was a fricken spike
Is blue price, and the bar graphs volume?
maybe
wait
im trying to find my awesomewm complain post
hi my name is cy
and i managed to generate
a python error
so long
it was longer
than the history
of the terminal
so i cant see what started it
rewrite your program in rust
cyrch single threaded gets 80 records per second
bspwm
now time for the fun stuff
multithreading
Wait cy
U have a thing that like downloads every page it sees
And download links as well right?
all links
50 threads is a bit much tho
Have u tried doing the world bank website?
that said it was doing like thousands and thousands
um
i can try with that as the entry point
if you want
Sure
I may download a lot i think
i mean it doesn't download everything
it downloads only html documents
nothing else
Ah then its useless
wait why
what do you want
I wanted to see if it would download all the data sets
it doesn't download anything
it only stores links
akhil
i mean it does download things
but it doesn't store them
you can use vim keybindings to switch windows in bsp
MOD + hjkl
Im
Downloading it
I mean awesome does too
but awesome is SO overcomplicated
Nope bspwm
\ hjkl would be so nice
guess i cant use ly
?
gimme an entry point
Um how bout the world bank
link
Or nasdaq exchange
link
how about
hmm
thats a redirect
it needs to return 200
doing this
imma time it and see how many links it can identify in 30 seconds
我是一个人
ignore
ls
lol
30 seconds
Nice
Thats alot isnt it?
this is different from before
in that
it identifies and stores
everything it finds
but
it does not know what is in everything
so last time i could run like 500 threads
searching the internet
this time i can only run like 3 or 4
Huh
because mongodb
takes cpu
but I still get more results
cuz im actually storing them
as opposed to only storing them when they are being searched
also i presume mongodb is giving me uniqueness
i am upserting
Owo nowo
Roman numerals
Are great
Ok this may be weird
i do not like it
But how much are abacuses
I had one
I want to use it again
It was so fun for quick calculations
…
ooh
polybar auto reloads
btw
bspwm comes with gaps ootb
alright so we are having some duplication issues
lol its because i left the test code in
time to scrap this and start over
lol
i was wondering
how things happened
so fast
i learned something today
this is what mongoDBCompass does when it cant find duplicates:
so now i have a nice, unique list
thanks to having fixed my code
I can't
adjust my volume
*yet cough
I have to add the pulseaudio module
lol linix
it's bspwm
not linux
in this case
>
i need to ban all links containing &amp
they break everything
things are getting interesting
WE WILL KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE IN THE US
AT EVERY POINT IN HISTORY
japanese
its like
idk where
it finds that
actually
i can find out
i think



ok
HA fas works

does that show up for you
no
this shows up on android
this doesn't show up anywhere
for me
Nada
im getting a
thing
called font awesome to work
in my bar
ok so this is cool right
so
i was like
where tf did this come from
and i now know the relations
after having done lots of testing
so
if you dont have it enabled
which the crawler doesn't obviously
at the bottom
there is a link for Kyo Nagashima
which has a link to the amazon site to purchase that book
That
Yes the internet is all connected
its quite fun to do
and it just like
downloads the internet
and finds sites that match a string
then you do this several times
and you end up with the result
gimme a list of URLs and i can scan them
no a list
imma get the entirety of the mongodb into a list
and then try some searches
cy can you send me a test discord message
nvm
i have an alt
im mad
i literally
had the perfect wallpaper
on unsplash
and then I tried clicking on it and i clicked the wrong button
and now I can't find it anymore
sad
for future reference
i like to make my own wallpapers
i did
but I don't want to use those
cy wallpaper
im going to try the chinese website
make that your wallpaper
i might make it mine
this is mine
but i have three monitors
so i have to make three choices
I have two of the three
ok im satisfied
my old house
sad
i preferred it
ah
where did you get the "sad" part
like just
sad
...
sad
im sad
"sad"
as a one word response
i like my old neighborhood better
it looked much nicer
imo
that said i would have like to live in one of the houses on James's steet
those were really nice
not the ones on his side
the  ones on the opposite side
Ah
I do not know where you are talking about
the ones on the ridge
idk
i need google maps or something
lets post this image to a random discord server
google maps
but i drove by that street yesterday
on the way back from the dentist
a lot of the houses were renovated
That's interesting
that house also looks like james's house
also
I shall sleep now
gn
James's house
hes on the not ridge side of sunset ridge
cys house
circa 2013
is there an inter monospace
that doesnt have the serifs of a monospace font
I dont think so
also cyrch now has an ultrafast mode
in which
it is getting
about 1.2k url identifications per second
like you run it for a couple minutes and you get hundreds of thousands of results
it slows down but it starts really fast
hi im pinging my refridgerator
ok the devs aren't that incompetent
WE ARE INDEXING
AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED
green means good
cyan means returned something other than 200, but still will process
blue means mime type was either not present or not text/html, and url was skipped
wait
once you index
what are you going to do with the data
that's a good question
idk
im running in unsafe mode rn
like windows unsafe mode
no
my program
is running in the mode
oh
unsafe mode
is not a thing
it is called
where the entire search index has to be in memory
regular windows
idk where that came from lol
so it just like
how much ram are you using rn
fills up the memory
lemme see
its doing like 2-3k urls per second
it has several modes this program
it has full featured mode
which takes hours to do what fast mode does in minutes
but in regular mode
the index is not stored in memory
it stores content type and status code for each url
and it takes popularity measurements
and you can run as many instances of it as you want
you can disable the logging of ct and sc for higher speed
then
there is memcache mode
where each instance of the program stores the known index in memory
and does not send upsert requests to mongodb if it sees the url in its cache
I see
this however, disables popularity measurements
no
I C
then
what if you write this in C
would it be faster
theres unsafe mode
unsafe mode
replaces upserts
with inserts
which increases speed
but causes minimal duplication
and you can only run one instance at a time
then theres fast mode
which is just
ct/sc logging off
memcache on
unsafe mode on
then you choose how many threads you want
this is running at 100 threads rn
in normal mode if you do more than 7 threads
your mouse stops moving
probably not
so how many requests per second?
right now?
yes
lemme see
its doing like 60-70 rps
although its highly variable
hmm ok
what if
but like 2-3k identifications per second
you made a search engine out of this
I intend to
Cyearch
cyrch
No I think Cyearch looks typographically superior
And the logo
should be
yes
coming out of the search bar
like just use various cy images
like the loading screen
my ban list isnt working tho
should have this one
so its like
indexing bing search
and wikipedia
albeit quite fast
but still
Wait
yes
i know what you are thinking
cuz that doesn't really work
that well
Cause u need a search term?
whats fun tho is i also have an ancestry generator
which like
figures out where a result came from
lemme run it one moment
Oh nice
I wanna start working with mongo
mongo is nice cuz its simple
also i fixed my bing and Wikipedia issues
i um
forgot to trim the whitespace
off my test conditions
so they were always false
but now that is fixed
so the results are much more interesting
Ah man
I hate when things are false
lol
verbose mode is fun to watch
though a bit dizzying
Its the stupidest state
Ah this?
U sent it before
yes that video
i really need to implement the stop event for playerctl
Thats ur bar thing right?
yuh
did cy see it
it shows the currently playing song at the top
this
i see
windows volume control has this
yes
but i get to write a python script
to do it
which is funner
cy likes his search indexer
although
now that its not just firing at bing
at max speed
its a bit slower
bing is really fast
like
exceptionally fast
It is
But i prefer the results from google
It usually has better results than bing
yeah
should i run a superspeed mode one on another site
yes
it has lots of links
it will lead
to twitter
yes but somehow that's like
not showing up much
hold on lemme do something then ill start that
and slowing down the system
Lol
did it get to the binary cache yet
since it has a repository
it does not download anything that is not text/html
nixos
has a
search feature
on its website
with like thousands of packages
that will link to a huge github repo
imma ban /nixpkgs/
drun
hi my name is cyrch
im doing 10k identifications per second
cyrch works distributed as well
you just need a mongodb server
and they will all report to it
so you can distribute your index
i presume its much faster tho if the mongodb is running on the same system
this is what im doing rn
yo akhil if you go to school i can give you the airport brick
If i go back to school
does this mean ramesh wants to go back to school
im already in the process of convincing my parents
aka
im going to make them sign up
Cause u got
tell me if you are able to
i have a few days
i dont think children will get the vaccine for a while
i might
i qualify
but theres not enough stock
i mean unless you have preexisting health conditions
I do
like
very mild asthma
idk my brother has asthma
i have asthma
it used to be worse
aka
my mom isnt even vaccinated yet
it's not very bad
shes like
a teacher
0.5/4 of my family is vaccinated
i see
does she go to rutgers
yes
ah
that is strange
not that often tho
she like
has to go sometimes
her colleague got it
even tho she never goes in
or so i hear
idk
also
Ur thing links similar things together right?
Windows Terminal is GPU accelerated
like Alacritty
or whatever its called
no
its in superspeed mode rn
so it just like
generates a list
and that's it
Ah
Cause if it linked similar things together it would be intresting to see like a visual model of the data
well
it has a 'from' tag
which means
you can form a path
that it took
to get to a link
its not fun tho cuz i made mistakes
also it like
which is like
everything
U should index
sometimes it does
my main issue is like
it gets stuck
on one site
so like
every
single
piece
file
page
for their linear algebra library
which is like thousands
and thousands
of urls
Oh god
and then
it will do this
for every language
they have
on the page
which takes like
hours
that said
reallly fast
so it didn't take a terribly long time
hi im android
you can
plug in an arduino
and i will talk to it
and give you a serial terminal
hi
im ios
if you plug in a non apple dongle
eyeohesse
i will brick your phone
thats like
false
maybe
but
i needed to make a point
no there are no dongles
cuz there is no USB
host
hi im ios
what is an arduino
hi im ios
you didn't plug anything in
hi im ios
ur holding ur usb port wrong
aka
you cant plug that in
hi im ios
what is usb
liteneng
AirDuino
WARduino
expanding into the military space
hi im ios
no
lol
warduino
raspberry bye
powers nuclear bombs around the world
raspberry pie
bye
hi im cy
i didnt read ramesh's story
lol
did you already sign up for in person
no
not yet
ah
im going to talk to my parents tomorrow
imo the benefits outweigh the risks for me
im almost certainly going in person
i hate
online learning
with a passion
idk
i just hate it
i cant do it
wait do we have lunch periods together
or is that akhil
that's akhil
what period
does akhil have lunch
8
i have
a free peroid
8
hmm
is akhil going to school again
no
what about
words
words?
also
convincing people to go in person in droves
might be bad
i suppose
just let ppl do what they want
Yeah
like my friend is telling me how he signed up to go in person
and like this affects my decision
but
i already wanted to go to school in person
also
do you take the bus
probably not at that point in the year
ah
this is all the 4.3 million things
im probably going to walk home
i have found
1 gigabyte
in a bit
im probably going to walk home
since i can
walk home
we should like
also akhil i see you online go to bed it's past your bedtime
walk for exercise
jk
Nope
exactly
5
?
no like
before
yes
Yes
in 8th grade
we did this every day
no not that before
like
before
4th mp
like
Tf u talkin bout
in the afternoon
idk
what you mean
before
my dad wants me to
and im like
bored
im going to walk home
since i dont
no like
in mp3
do anything productive immediately after school
like rn
in the afternoon
oh you mean like
yes
the thing where you are like
hey ramesh
yes
want to go for a walk
no
m hm
ill go for a walk with you
from school
ok
also i think my other friends
might walk home with me
so i might alternate
i mean
the direction
is like
similar right
meh
if you are still walking home
mezclando mis amigos no siempre funciona
Must be nice
cyfinfaza: mixing my friends doesn't always work
To be able to walk home
i basically walked home
all the days of mp4
in 8th grade
so i think I can do it again
i walked home
all the Thursdays and fridays
of mp1 and mp2
this year
ah
also advisory is going to be annoying
having to sit there when i could just walk home early
lol yes its not like at home
where u have big pc
it's fine
i need to buy a battery for my laptop tho
the hp one
you will have to move from 3 monitors to half a monitor
that dell one is so junk im not going to
use it
the xps?
yes
i hate it
whats wrong with it
the camera
um
also it's too small
i have my lenovo
also watch as btsd_guest bans my mac address
the gpu fails
Is it the one on the bottom?
yes
Spoof it
tahts what i do
i open my laptop in 9th grade
and
it no work
i can connect to BTSD
Same
apparently
they blocked discord
or BTSD_GUEST
but
so i think wireguard
to gcp
is in order
no they didnt
thats what my friend said
they probably block that tho
nah
ill just
change the port
lol
also i doubt
the sysadmis know what wireguard is
hmm
ik they block OpenVPN UDP 1194
akhil are you thinking nixos rice for the hp laptop?
for when i go to school
nixos is fairly reliable once you get a stable config
Yes
lol tried to open the 1.5 gb json file
in vscode
Its not a bad idea
oom
out of memory
lemme try it in emacs
Its just very annoying
i know nix
so
From what o have seen anyway
Yea so it may be nicer
i have quite a bit of experience with it
so it might not be so hard
I say go ahead
also i can run zoom on linux
since i can just tell the teachers
to readd me
when it kicks me out
also i hate emailing teachers
im deleting this part
im going to add a new scene instead
so instead of just saying it
i will
exemplify his insanity
Show it
ill be like
wait i gotta collect my thoughts
basically hes going to fail something in school
and then
he will expect julia to like
ask him whats wrong
and when nothing happens
he'll get really depressed
Yes
and then it goes away when he forgets about it
Bueno
at the cousins' house
like
like what happens at the end
not as bad
Yes
but like hes going to think that way
and like maybe do a little bit of it
im being vague here since cy might be reading
and i dont wanna spoil
Yea
but it's a good plan i think
Well go ahead and write the scene
have any additional suggestions?
Yea
either that or im going to sleep
Um as i remember not really
The rest of the story is fine
mhm
i think i might add in  a thing
explicitly saying how he feels better
soemtime during the cousins' house scenes
Add that part and I’ll read it again and provide thoughts
fun
aight imma do that
i might intentionally write it really badly though
since according to brandon sanderson
that's a good writing technique
then you improve that scene
Really?
Well idk i dont write often
yeah
you should get into it
it's really fun
right fixed that
cyrch was being a memory hog
honestly I think that tempering your expectations for anything is a good idea
it especially applies when you have high expectations
this is just this general life fact that I am also beginning to realize
also this has nothing to do with school
i am still going to school
just like i have realized this
like how our narrator of white is black realizes things
i see
i have similar thoughts
but they are a bit different
dont spend much time on things you want to be happy about
because
if you spend too much time on them
and they turn out to fail
you will be very sad
true
I think I also have something like this
Like
In the middle of february I basically set myself to be like
The reason I can keep doing things and be happy is that im almost there to go to school
like
going to shcool will apparently
save me
idk why
lol no dont think that
yea
i
that's a path to
am aware
of this
bad
i know
i am not
i dont think that anymore
but if you put all your expectations in something
and then it doesn't work
then you get sad
but I think I might add something
keep you eggs in different baskets
you can put all your expectations in something
but also keep in mind that you like
it might not end well
and be very aware of that
so when you actually have your expectations fail
it will not be do disappointing
i say "oh its just some fun thing, it doesn't matter"
so put everything in one basket and then expect it
if it fails
whatever
to destroy itself
if it succeeds
we forget what i said
and if it does then whatever
exactly
I'm not so good at shrugging things off
if things fail
me neither
unless like
its just
"some fun"
Yeah but what if nothing is just
"some fun"
I mean i classify my programming projects as
"some fun"
since I don't really care if they fail
cy has to do like
the entire oral history project
Evanston
tonight
Oh dear
okay
have fun
*fun
*cough
then he has to do an AP Seminar EOC-Style Written Argument Analysis™
kolidge bored
do you really not support CJK
?
chinese
oesnt
work
oh
in inter
send me a Chinese character
or two
零
k thx
天
wonderful!
idk how to fix that
google fonts has a "language" picker
so you can pick a language
i could use
source han sans
yes
like my favourite font
but inter just
looks good here
that's good
but
just the introduction
now it shows up
but i dont like
it doesnt look good here
lol so that's why you need a china font
yes
i think SegoeUI
has like
Chinese characters
i need to figure out a fallback
for inter
and then it will work
try Segoe
I uninstalled Segoe
it screws up my font configuration
on linux
i think
it installs the windows xp version of segoe
so it is not antialiased or whatever
Microsoft YaHei
ig this is fine
dont send really long screenshots
you can click on it
yes but its annoying
also i cant really
show this
without a long screenshot
you can make it taller
then it would be less long
relatively speaking
ah
okay then I will do that next time
ok thx
i need a better cjk font
i mean my system ui font is source han sans
Cyrch now has a Cross-Domain Only mode
which makes for fun results
cuz it ignores all links
what does it do
oh
that link to the same host
interesting
how big is the dataset rn
i have many datasets
the one im doing rn
is
oh also it now has a timeout
no like
the size
in gigabytes
interesting
cyearch
wait
thats
outdated
^^ not outdated
still not big
Yea i expected gb
Also i may go to skool mp4
oo
see i told you
you didnt tell cy before
Did i not?
I swear i sent this before
this is the first i hear
told you
you must have like
forgotten to press send
Well there u go
I may just he stupid
ok so i can be less worried
to tell my mom
to put me in school
wdym less worried
i mean shes gonna anyway
so like
you should be more worried
also whens the deadline again
myp arents havent put it in yet and i dont want them to forget
idk like
soon
Friday i think
also imma work at the pool
in the summer
maybe
ah
if I get vaccinated
Nice
im going to make a system
bettter
telegram bots
Im trying to get internships
discord bots
idk what they want
multithreaded requests
distributed pings
huge numbers of providers
and by the time i am done
we will have mass vaccination
should i rewrite cyrch in rust
so there will be no point
if you want to spend a few months learning rust sure
but yes
tbh it would probably take me a day or two
since that is a meme
do you know
what
ownership is
more or less
how about
the difference between &str and String
yes
since i dont really but i kinda know
im too lazy
i know what it is
what is &str
a pointer/reference
no it is a slice
which is
a pointer
basically
but rust does its own thing
i mean the thing is like
lol so it is a pointer basically
python is not htat bad
with memory management
yeah
rust might be a bit faster though
idk how fast so you would have to write it and try
its an easy project to try and rewrite
the thing is like
in order to exceed the speed
the multithreading has to be good
yes
the multithreading is good
very good
ive worked with it before
it's really well designed
my problem rn is that like
it slows down
idk why
then
it stops.
idk why
then
try writing something simple
it goes reallly fast
i have to do my homework now
bye
me too
thanks for refocusing me
bye
just wanted to ask everyone
who would be interested in working on a hardware project
if there was one to work on
If it were my hardware project and you were all working with me
Then i would be
It would be cool
As in
My idea
Huh
so not if it were mine
Or akhil's
interesting
what if it was shared tho
I have had lots of experience with projects
It is never truly shared
i see
And trying to share
Does not work well
Since there is no one to direct stuff
Although that
May be false
I'm pretty sure shared things are possible but i still
you know from my experience working in teams
Nah its true in many things
^
there are 2 positions
people like to snap to
im the leader
and its your job
and they take one of these 2 sides
but sometimes
people can switch sides
in fact this is what happened at drama club
i took charge of the lights
but then i released charge of the lights
to my partner
and we worked covalently
I dont
we shared charge
Wanna see that word
hybridization
b o n d i n g
STOP NO OH GOD
I still dont even get sp3 hybridization
ya take the orbitals
and ya smush em
Well yea no duh
Idk the hybridizations are weird
my dad's smart indian friend who lives in california
was talking about cubesats
hes really excited about them
Ah those
We had this discussion
When i wanted to launch a satellite to space
yes
well he was saying theres this professor
who is doing a summer program on cubesats
or something
where like
the group will try and build a cubesat
and if they can build something relevant
and get the neccesary funding
they will actually send it into space
and that smart indian friend
Thats cool
who i will now refer to as Partha
Its sad it only lasts for like 15-20 years
lol 15-20 years
But thats enough if ur doing
Research
Or anything of the sort
see partha wanted to work on them
he said he would work on software
idk
its a bit too
distant
from me
literally and figuratively
but its a really cool project
so i just wanted to let ppl know
since he likes rokkits
rokkits are cool
you gotta put 2 k's
or else its rowe kits
cy is trying to rewrite cyrch in Rust
I hav been summend
yes u have
this project
About wut
scroll to here
I'm in
Cubesats
Ooooo
I freaking love cubesats
I hav a gud ieda for a pulpulsion system
i can forward you the email
Yuhhh
I would luv to do that
Cuz like
I was too young for the airforce reacherch lab thing
This
And haven't heard back with the other reacherch thing I applied to
NASA internships are like 16+
I did
nice
I would never get in
i mean
there is a chance
I apploed
Applied
i sent it to michael
Oooooo
also i will put the message here
I definitely wanna do this
Cy u gonna do this
its still in discussion
but if lotsa ppl wanna do it
i wanna do it
My dog is attacking me I gtf
Gtg
bye i gtg too
to go to history tutorial
WoR is words of radiance
a book
Which is good btw
The interludes are intresting as heck
read
issac finished
the entire series
while you are stuck on the second book
imma try windows on raspberry pi with dual displays
I havent read in a while
I am now
traitor
So i will finish it
i hate the english book im reading
i have to read it
since i signed up to read it
i just
hate it
who
wtf
this person keeps giving me awards
just for literally no reason
on this one post
ok is greyed out
ruby
my parents think I should wear a face shield to school
or if not
i need to get glasses
because I can get covid through my eyes
Um
no
it is a thing
i looked it up
but like
it's not the most common way to get covid
but you are protected
since you have glasses
Idk if u want just wear like sunglasses
apparently glasses dont even go a good job
hell no
Yea no
but to my parents
it is enough
tbh im not even sure why i need to wear glasses but if that's what they want I'll do it
any updates on your end akhil
Nope
regarding going to school
rip
it's due on friday
so make sure you figure it out before then
Yup
"In sweden, it is forbidden by law to be a criminal"
BAM.
Safest place ever
No crime
True
i need to fix my pi
aka
it needs ethernet
How u doing it?
i really wanna write something in C
hi im working on my pc through a raspberry pi over RDP
WoR
its a project
to install windows on raspberry pi
program an stm32
I do not want
to do microcontrollers
why
this is like asking me
why
i like blue
more than green
it's just like
a current personal preference
ok
i copied rust code from the internet
then
it said error
i was thinking of making the vaccine thing in C
then i waited an hour
and now
it says not error
whats the rust code for
also you can just ask me
i will probably tell you how to fix it
i think the issue is the vscode language server
starts to die
ah
just
when i run cyrch
no the vscode language features for rust
are like
really nice
yes
rls
is the lsp server for rust
the same thing happens for python now
ok then idk
see my hope is
if i write cyrch in Rust
did you install the discord rpc for vscode
continue
see what happens with python right now
is that
the memory fills up
then empties
then fills up
then empties
also the multithreading is bad
yes
so the hope is that the whole ownership thing will deal with the memory issues
rust has VERY good threading support
and the multithreading will be less problematic
yes
however
does rust have
rust also has async if you want that
sets
hashmaps?
a set
what is a set
isn't it like
a random
like a list
but each item is unique
std::collections is your friend
i see
also i could consider writing cyrch in nodejs
since its faster than python
and also has better threading
idk
i hate js
but that is a me thing
i wanna try rust tho
now if you'll excuse me
i have to go
bye
bye
GLib is very interesting
the spanish teacher has mastered the art of clickbait
hey ppl
its 4pm
Hi
It is 4:01 PM
cherry is sad
its too late
i hate daylight savings time
it is awful
in all respects
it will get better
also
ive stayed up
to daylight savings time
every year
in march
for the past three years
so this will now be a tradition
mines different
i gotta do physics

3153
USPS might be able to get mail to me like 

253-07920-3153
That would be extremely cool
if we all just got a 9 digit number as our house ID
so you dont remember addresses
you just
253-079203153
ooh
fun
wait
actually
the short plus codes require a city name
if there is no city
like in the middle of the North Atlantic Ocean
you get something like
Does anyone want to do a hackathon with me
Like as a group
i said i was interested
so like
if we can get a group
Yea that would be good
is this online
Yea like all of the hackathon are online
Yeah ok no
I'm
allergic to online hackathons
But
Lmao
but if stuff
If we all get vaccinated and this is during the summer or something and things are normal again
then yes
Ok notes
Noted*
Yep
lokk and feel
i honest
want to downloadly this
um
what tf am i downloading
its ok i can download it for you
im scared this is going to have
like
child no no content
and have Windows Defender scan it
Lol
I mean give it a whirl
man the innovations we're missing out on
i need to learn C
why
cuz you wanna become a linix contributor
and they only use c
?
maybe i'll rewrite cyrch in c
hmm
what if i rewrite cyrch
in every language
and see which one is fastest
as a language learning exercise
its actually a really good project
it involves interfacing with databases
the internet
data processing
concurrence
Yes
mongoc
i should do some c
c is just a pain
cuz like
objects
are not really a thing
it is however nice
in other respects
like
if i wanna map a number to a character a through z
also you can implement your own memory management
to get stuff done, use python.
to make websites, use JavaScript.
to make low level fast things, use c
to make low level fast things without it being a pain in the tukkus to manage dependencies and more complex data types like objects
use rust
if you take APCS
use Java
if you're a physicist
use Matlab
if you're Ben Eater
use
w i r e s
rewrite
cyearch
in wires
manually implement tcp
My mom has successfully connected to Rutgers OARC Amarel
this is a very interesting system
idk exactly how it works
member methods in my language will not be self.
or
will be
since apostrophes and ownership are a thing in english
thus I have just made more logicality
lol
does that actually make any sense tho
um
tbh idrk
its like
'something'.something?
no
like
say you have an object
inside a class
like you know how in python
you have to do like
self.instancemethod
or java: this.instancemethod
yes
in wel (my programming language)
you do
um
if you have instantiated, it is different
what about string literals
wdym strings
oh
it doesnt end with a quote
it only starts with one
but
kinda like 'a in rust
you can call the 'a anything you want
like
'randomlifeteimename
except this is totally different
but what
how will it conflict?
will be valid in my language
('something, 'hello')
yes
the comma
also
but
the solution is
that throws a syntax error
('something, "hello")
('something, '"hello"')
yes
'murca
'murica
is valid syntax
it autoparenthesizes it
so
not from
select all users
select(all(users))
is that the interpreter does
in cases where it cant figure it out
variable = 'something
1) varargs probably wont exist
2) you just put parentheses
no
no cy
there is no equals
variable 'something
?
no equals
to assign a variable
if you want a string
then how do you name the variable
you do
cow "moo"
> cow
prints moo
first "thing" on the line
so if you want to increment an int 10 times and print it
you
a++ returns the value as well
>10++variable
what
would be my syntax
Hmm
i mean i have a better map syntax
so
if you want to do something on all the objects
that's not map syntax
no
this is unrelated
say you have an array full of strings
yes...
you want to add "moo" to each
python might be a = [ i + "moo" for i in a]
this is
a.* += "moo"
.?
what is the .
and the star
the star
means
"do this on all the items in the list"
so its kind of like
a spread operator
but not
what is a spread operator
lol
ramesh is dumb
what
what does that do
it spreads
the dict
isnt that like rust
when you make a struct
no that's js
you can like
copy the fields
with
..otherobject
see like
yeah
thats python as well
..
js does ...
i like js in certain ways
it has logic
but the map thing
i dont like your map thing
its illogical
to me it is logical
but wait cy
anything.anything
you havent even heard
the highlight
of my language
is one thing
not many
idk but
ok
...
the main feature
is blocks.
everything in the language is a block
for scoping
i thought of a thing with blocks
yes
the solution
to scope
is contexts
you can run a block
with a scope
yeah
like a specific scope
so
when you do the
where do you think the key comes from
what is crud
create read update delete
it automakes
the api
for you
with its web framework called doublespeed
morethanexpress
mor ethan express
anyway
tf
the r is a block that will like execute on the beginning of the read method
but
but
but
context is a thing right
so some methods can take blocks
that execute in the local scope
or mixed scopes
and then
blocks are not procedures.
and you are passing a block to class
so the fundamental language is based on blocks
i like simplicity
my syntax would be mostly pythonic
since it is fairly logical
that way its easy to learn
and gets rapid adoption
mine is also logical
because
you can do
plain english
want me to
what about workspaces
explain how this works
the exec block thing
collections of variables
wdym collections of variables
like
and wth are workspaces
thats only something in vscode
not in any language
here lemme make an example
k
also good please keep challenging my language
i need to flesh it out more
so this is helping
this
is amazing
anyhow
what is a workspace
a collection of variables
so sort of a scope
but it can be shared
ah
also idk what that async block is doing
there
you dont need it
there are no
{}
curlies
yeah I suppose contexts will do what you want
yeah
also
thats not the syntax for wel
no thats the cyntax for cy
stored in a .cy file
waitfor
not wait for
wait for finish of myctx
or
no
yeah
thats what ill do
what else do yo want
waitfor finish in each myctx
wdym in each
that's the same thing
no thats illogical what i wrote
these languages are hard to write
wait for myctx finish
is what it would translate to
i really like how js does events tho
so like
you would make a jobqueue
then do
what do you think about the parenless syntax tho
lol
the problem with all these on in wait from etc
is that like
they remove variable names
frankly
what i want
is very simple
python
python isnt bad
but
with javascripts event based functionality
my language did i say
it was typed
and rust's scoping
what i want is
ruby's shortcut syntaxes
but less verbose
also console.log
and more like the JVM
is
very
relevant
my print
there needs to be easy logging
is defined as
oh right
when I write an OS
im going to kill stdout
and stderr
there will be one thing
called
stdlog
imma write an os too
at some point
im going to write it in rust
when i practice C
frankly
and it's going to be
it will be easier
for raspberry pis
to rewrite cyrch in c
than in rust
have fun with your unsafe threading
better use those mutexes or else youre done
the threading is not unsafe in python
its actually good
i meant c
i had 1000 threads running
and no duplication
yeah c
uh
haha
free
funny
haha
threading
true
maybe try go
go is just java but like
worse
oh yeah forgot there was go
should try that too
tbh
go
is statically typed
and
doesnt have templating
js will probably be the fastest
i mean they are adding it but it took 10 years
ruby is my weapon of choice with interpreted
personally i want a jruby
that is
not jvm
and has even more shortcuts
cy
have you tried ruby
i may start doing everything in typescript
yeah
then i will cease to have to worry
about all this
but have you tried ruby
cuz js and typescript
work for everything
no
try it
it's so sugary
k ill add it to the list
lol
like
i like sugar
theres python
and then
the python replacement for me
is ruby
since ruby is so nice
python no sugar
just veggies
yes
ruby is
like
just like
let me show you an example:
sugar is really annoying
let's say you have a null variable
but also like
how do you check
really ncie
reall yquickly
like
if var
then
like
wdym
what if i wanna do like
say we have a class
it has an instance varabiel
which is a bool
and i wanna check the bool
but idk if var is null
vahrabee el
shut
tell me how to do it
in python
um
ik it's simple
the instance thing is called
admin
like
no theres probably a shorter syntax
if user.admin
butuser
will throw an error since it's null sometimes
what if it's null huh
so you do
in ruby it's just
if user and None or user.admin
what
and
also wont that still throw an error
since it does the user.admin part
part of the check
idk actually
also in js
like
terenary things are interesting
cuz like
you can
that works
like
surprise
in js
if you
do
true && "hello"
it returns hello
yeah
like lisp
idk what the || version of that is
lol
in js [] === [] will always be false
anyarray === anyarray
== false
js has a straightforward mapping function
js is just
cy
did you see that website
no not really
see it
it is
wonderful.
Web design
also bpython good
At its greatest
i clik link
linc goud
cy has to avoid failing math
he will leave
bye
hi
i signed up for in person
what is GraphQL
a fancy query language
for lazy frontend devs
who wanna put all the work on the backend devs
essentially
you say
gimme this data
formatted this way
and since its a query language
you can query within the structure
so something like
im going to try it
it sounds like serde
bananas smaller than 30 centimeters{
proteins bigger than 25 atoms
}
yes
there will be no
smaller than
but that is graphql right
yes
that is like
pseudo graphql
like not actually graphql
yeah
i was gonna say
but it makes a schema
yes
yeah
seems like a good idea
ill try it
its for apis
i have yet to understand some of the implementations
but i will learn it when i need to
or next time i make an api
its another thing made by facebook
i must go
then when i come back
i must continue averting crisis in Honors Precalculus
ah
yes
i heard you have a test tomorrow
yes and i havent studied
ok
go
bye
good luck
since last week
yes
go do that
bye
but i worked today
for hours
on this?
and i have 1.5 hours left
of practice
i will now take a shower
good bye
do that
bye
you're not allowed to win
oh god
how do i
disable notifications
on my own channel
gee thanks madame koch
you put
my entire conversation
in front of the class
in front of the class again
in a playposit
you put me
in a playposit
for 2 French classes to watch and answer questions on
asd;flkjhasdf
um cy
tf is ur channel doing
cy is frustrated with math
he is not managing to improve his scores
last year they were all around an 82%
this year
they are very high
95%
90%
100%
and then
50%
me in ap calc
100
99
98
99
100
81
then
98
theres always one or two things
that are just
bad
yeah
c'est la vie
I suppose
but I it means I cannot get an A
it bars me
do you want to take BC
i wanna take AB then BC
good
dont take just bc
AB is easier anyway
what are you taking
AB
next year BC
ok
I could've taken BC
But my parents convinced me to not
so I didn't
I do not regret taking AB
i am not sure what to do
with this year
i practice and practice
and it amounts to this
its like
some things are just not easy
some things work out
I think that's what happens to me
I kept trying at that thing i got an 81
and then
i kept getting it wrong
ill probably disappear till thursday
i have a heck load of tests coming up
barrage
Ah nice
APUSH, Physics, Calc
I really need to study for calc
im not getting it wrong per se
im paranoid tho now
so I really need to practice a lot
I need to study for apush
I love how inheritance is often irrelevant in dynamically typed languages
cy
is cy in precalc? probably
the ten words that have just been stated are false.
cy how are you going to filter NSFW content from cyearch
you would be really rich if you invested in moderna
Eh kinda
it went
from 13 dollars
to like
165
in the past year
From 2020-2021
If u invested then yea
If u invest now not really
yeah
but then
if you had in march last year
you would be
Pretty sure thats what people did
I think people just invested in the sector
What bout it?
lo que pasará, pasará
or
lo que será será
Ah i should change my github status thingy
this is mine
also ur pfp is good
Yea i like it
I like mine too
it's a bird
Which type?
A blue jay I think
Not 100% sure
sinθ
these are my emacs configs
yea i saw
they look nice
see
should i get a start page?
yes
they r nice
they look good
cause i can
but its kinda useless
ill do it why not
lol
i gtg now
bye
cy
do you respect robots.txt?
maybe that might help
also idk if you know but wel's contexts might just be dictionaries
like
you can define dictionaries but they are called contexts
cmake?
i couldnt ever figure out the build systems
i might try ninja
i see
thats like
the #1 reason i didnt learn C
raspberry pi
Light3s?
k3s server
running alpine
Ah nice
lightweight AF
My hyperv kinda isn’t creating vm for some reason
So i can’t get k3s to work
call rahul from mumbai tech support
Ah yes
he will scan for virus on computer
Of course
and tell if you need spyware cleaner
i was going to say is this go
but why is point defined twice
idk
mm
also that font
try jetbrains mono
Lol
lol funny
cuz
i didnt
copy that
i actually thought of this
… oh.
i should try C
OH GOD
one line of Python
one line
really?
one line?
whawhat is the one line
make a bson document
like
its literally
passed in as a dictionary
cuz those are a thing
in the modern world
try rust?
no im using c rn
lol
hi my name is cy
and i got mongoc to work
Hi yc
my gosh
that's good
how about threading
lol
we're getting there
first i have to figure out the pattern
I would try to develop this in rust at the same time
of what is a pointer
and what is an acutal variable
but I am going to do work soon
so no
lemme now try some http requests
try libcurl
i wonder if paying a little trip to russia could be uesful
like
my genesis thing says that I will go on apri 1st
but the form said the 26th
idk
it is now time
to read memory without permission
did you mean segfault?
this allocates memory
writes to it
prints it out to the terminal
then
it frees the memory
and once again prints it out to the terminal
…
isn't it reading unallocated memory then
yes
it is
lol i tried to read from memory location 0
is this wsl
yes
what does it show on windows
idk i didn't feel like compiling for windows
and installing things
lol
time to fill up lots of memory
and then free it
as a test
haha yes
dynamic arrays
"arrays"
lol
are you like
reimplementing strings
i guess
cygh
i got the wrong book
i need an aarch64 book
what an idiot I am
still not working
oh wait
it doesnt actually FILL it
im stupid
not enough
hi ramesh
how tf does jrunner5 work
i need to make it connect to the server
do i need to make environment variables or something
also the path needs to be variable
also if they are environment variables please change that
to like
a config file
what
umm
i forgot lol
dammit now Java is being a pain
lemme see
i need to set my JAVA_HOME
variable
idk what to set it to
it uses
env vars
and why do you want it to use a file
cuz then like
its very portable
you just gradlew run
and that's it
what aint portable about env vars
you have to set them
ok…
and you have to set the configuration file
only once
same with env vars…
if you do it right
no not if you move it to a different system
with python i use dotenv
then like
its portable
mhm
i would add a dotenv
to jrunner5
is that ok
well its effectively a config file
so yes
ok
lol
ok
ill add this
also make the path variable
one sec
for now i need to un-die java
ramesshhhh
yes
*yawn
use java 15
what am i using?
also i am not doing the dotenv now
1.8
i have too much work
you need 1.15
um
ok
ramesh
um
is Jrunner5 supposed to make an error
or something
or react at all
if anything is sent
yes
ok, its not
it is supposed to react
um
ill see
like
i sent it a json
which is wrong
but
it didn't throw an error
or display
anything
show me
what it shows
it may not react if it's invalid
sounds fine
try using the test py file
ok
rameshshshsh
how do i
make a protobuf
to send
ramesh
its not
working
the protobuf
asflka;jsdlfkja;sdlkfj
why do we have to use protobuf
lol i spel
also if you want proof that protobufs are just like
strings that are a mess
is a protobuf
smh
i almost have this working
i just need to stop being dumb
and implement things
did you see the example code
it makes protobufs
also im doing work
bye
ill help yu during CSC ill be done then
lol
like i have way too much work
i got it working
so
nice
i spel
it werk
also someone
find out
why it says i am going to school irl on april first
because thats not what the form said and im confused
and i want to know the answer
idk ill ask my parents later
k
and see what they say
my parents said the 26th
but
my friends said the 1st
like
earlier than the first
which sounds wrong
but ok
idk
but tell me what you hear
bye
bye
hi status update
things sort of work
at least sending jobs does
but
jrunner5
only works the first time
like you connect it
send it a job
it works
returns the result
then you send it another job
and it dies and vomits an exception
its sufficient tho for now
so when ramesh has a moment
we will discuss
show error
i have to eat dinner
bye
cy problem
try using wsl or lunix
bye
ok actually it might not be but ill figure it out later
no actually it might be a you problem
lol
bye
ok but it works the first time
just not the second time
wait gimme the website to ur codetools
this may involve me
so try it
not on the big web
atm
yes
why?
web-view
with rust
interesting
its like a lightweight electron
really lighweight
i see
see right now
i need to implement job reprovisioning
so that each time ramesh's jrunner dies
it will provision to a new one
it
does not die on my end
let me try
actually
hold on
ramesh
the thing is online
do this
connect a jrunner instance
on your end
to my server
wait no that wont work cuz i need to unblock ur ip
tell me ur ip
wait
one second
try and connect
i allowed ur ip
i am not seeing anything
on my end
im
not connected yet
ok
will you be connected
soon
yes
ok
actually no
idk why
but it wont compile
whats the error
wait a few minutes
some type mismatches
ok
but is this a different version from the one i have
i dont think so
then why wont it compile
i think
the library updated itself
ok
ik what happened
ok...
ok
it connected
ooh it did
lemme try and run something
it ran right
yes
ok now lemme run again
it died
and now it died
ok strange
let me see why
tell me if you want me to run something
yes
do that
again?
no
ok
i want to try something first
before
try
i will entertain this till 9:11
then I must go
ok try again
ah ok so it fails to receive correctly
ok...
try
again
wack
are you sure the client is working properly
wdym
that is the client
jrunner5
i mean the server
i mean
its doing the same thing each time
i think
can you like
print out what the program recieves
ues
it does not
receive
um
it does not receive anything and that is where it throws the error
btw
wait
wait
wait
i am waiting
try
nvm
ok try
again
it says
deflate
so this is likely some kind of deflation issue
on your server side
um
i have made many websocket servers
with python websockets
that all work
just fine
im thinking this is deflate
i can attempt to disable the deflation thing
yes do that
and then call me back
ok
you have to disable it in kotlin tho
so do that
i will
k lemme see how to disable it on my end
oh that was easy
ok compression is off
and the browser just accepts that
ok
try now
again
it probs wont work
nvm
it worked.
it worked.
ha.
ha ha.
yes it works now
that is
good
this is temporary
we will get deflate to work
but not today
ok um
ill push my changes
ok
try it out
ok one moment
ill stay until it works
also
i changed the path
to /ecws/runner
i will make the path variable in the future
ok
dammit
yup
its
working
now 2 of them can be connected
and it will like
choose the one with the least running jobs
*cough once i implement deleting the job when its done
do you want me to keep mine running
sure
k
just run it rn
i wanna see what happens
k
i did
it seems to default to mine
interesting
actually
stop yours
stopped
ok
imma do more stuff
do you want it on or off
leave it off
cuz also
like
if i restart the server
yeah
it will disconnect
it will
crash
i have to fix that
if you wanna make me fix it open an issue
or ill forget
it doesn't matter that much
we can see later
k
i gtg
bye
bye
That was caused by me
Lol
yes
and also
it doesn't work
just wait
it will
eventually...
Ok
you have to set
your env vars
smh
this is driving me insane
TF is the deal with those margins
i must attack the margins
bye
hi my name is Madame Koch
you wanna hear something funny
you?
oh
eleves
cdknight: students
oh
the math teacher told us there were ways she could prevent us from using calculators for matrices
like putting variables in them
…
jokes on her
numworks
Lma
lol
does it actually
yes
nice
lol
undef
TI
KhiCAS might do even better
i wanna vaccine
ramesh
hello
i qualify
hi
yes
but
idk
lol
lol
imma email mrs baker and tell her to use numworks
yes
kill TI
TI bad
yes
overpriced
unfriendly to hobbyists
but also like
in order to get a TI emulator
you have to like
SAT approved ✅
she cant pretty sure
why not
cause the curriculum teaches with TI's
yeah but like
have you tried to make a matrix on a numworks
there might be cases where they might be open-minded
and a ti
you still
learn the same stuff
well no so heres the thing
yea but she has to show whichever one the majority has
she told ppl
to go into the testnav
and the textbooks as well teach TI's
to get a TI
and im like
lol
or me
i need to learn how to use the TI tho
otherwise imma be killed at some point
when they tell me
i cant use my numworks
i know how to use a TI
it's
slow
literally is there anything else I can say
if you want to know how the pandemic changed me it has nothing to do with either of these
oh wait
the numworks does not do variables in matrices
only Omega does
lol
omega is good
also
yes
someone should make a TI84 emu
for the numworks os
lol
what
it probs can run it
its ARM
ti is ti
the ti is z80
so you would need an emulator
to emulate the ti architecture
you would also need TI firmware
hey cy
did you know that james
according to him
is gay and polygamous
um
i did not know
what tf is ur cyhannel doing?
its sent out like at least 3000 messages
should i change jrunner5's wss mode to "slave client"
i mean idk but i agree that changing "master" to "main" is silly
Runner node
EDGE IS BEING A BORK
STOP
its like
taking
a css file
that does not exist
and is not referenced
and applying it
to my page
and its breaking it
as;dflkja;sdlfkj
hi my name is create-react app
and the world revolves around me
um
new zealand
has had
26 deaths
total.
from covid-19
new Zealand has
64 identifications
of people
that exist
NZ population is like 100k
yes cy
we got a new fridge
next is a range
Those r some nice lookin stoves/ovens
khiller ranges
in stock in a few years
aaasdf;lakdjf;alsdfkjasdfasd;lfkajsd;lfkajsd;fasdlkfja create-react-app
cy did you sign up for in-person yet
officially
yes
ok
good
i hate
compiled
now you will assert your superior screwmanship
interpreted languages
um
that is
what wel will be
do you hate wel
it drives me insane
its like
a;sdlkfja;sdlkfj
no well will be more like
bytecode
why is it so hard
to deal with this
create-react-app
why is it so hard to write a garbage collector
imma ask matt
do you know matt
there is like
literally
no way
to
make my flask compatible html
with create-react-app
it just
wont work
yes
because {{ right
no
because it like
changes everything
this is why i gave up
basically:
hold on imma keep experimenting
you're not supposed to mix the server-side and client-side rendering together
you are
supposed to write an API
and then use that API with the frontend
and have two separate projects
that's not the part im dealing with rn
but yes
that is
correct
and sad
and correct
but ok
not too sad
right now
create-react app
ok
so
this is what it does
it
makes a bunch of js and css files
that are like some random hex code
.js
and then it generates an html file
with the required tags
to import this
and it changes the filenames
with each build
so its not like i can create a static html file
that jinja sees
so its just
a pain
imma figure it out bye
18.5k messages lol
lol
lol
hi samantha
long time no see
Ye
I keep forgetting I have this muted
lol
Cuz the amount of spam
it's not spam
it's just
and power supply
high quality spam
U get what I mean
I don’t wanna get constantly pinged during class
true
does someone know if they block telegram in school
no
not
yeah but like
blocked
they blocked
stuff
during mp3
um
i could set up a vpn server in the school
i was thinking
and then be able to test things remotely
of mailing 5 dollars to mullvad
i can get someone
to turn on the computer
so akhil can control it
i dont have access
its under akhils account
also that's weird
see what i want
he can share it with you
what i want
i think if you run a pi
it oculd work
is to set up a vpn server
in the school
that is on a vpn
into the school
so
right
you can get into the school right
Its still on my account
inbound requests come from a vpn at home
Which is great
and then they go into that vpn
but it will be slow
right
or do u not have garbagoptimum
gimme back access
so i can connect
He doesnt
Uh one second
whats the school speedtest
Whats ur email?
1.2 gbps
wifi?
no ethernet
what
wifi is 750 mbps
is the wifi speed
ah
up or down tho
both
on a gigabit usb ethernet adapter
so like
it could be faster
ok so
you want to run a vpn server in the school
like a gateway
yes
inside the schol
and have it not broadcast its ssid
1) how are you going to power it
U need port forwarding don’t u?
no
listen to me
i ask
someone
like
mrs tan
…
if i can install it
in the classroom
…
ok …
…
no comment…
ok
what are you going to say it does
allows me to connect remotely
tbh idrc
its just a fun idea
i wanna like
run a vpn in aws
then I can just
connect to the vpn in aws
why tho
just run it at home
U should be added back
RH-623-05
i no see
I sent u the invite link to the vnc team
oh wait
cy
did you forget
i have garboptimum?
Yup same here
I may not tho
also
security concerns
of just
leaving my ip open
lol
it's not huge
the computer is not listening
for cloud connections
Get mullvad
mullvad
might get blocked
Cause its prob not on
yeah
cy
yes
if you do do the rpi thing
then
"test if any site is blocked in BTSD and learn how to access it"
lol
i have to wrestle with create-react-app
bye
bye
hi akhil
hows ur rust going
pretty well
show
i have to create an initial model right
so im trying to think what i would need
you have multiple components
well not components
like data
the initial model is i32
umm
just like
because all it is is a counter
usb
device
and then
data
but what does the first page do
well no its i need iso path as string, usb path as vector probably
its a structure
iso than usb device
similar to popsicle
yea this has to go under msg or something
im still lookin at documentation
lol
lol
ah how convienent
imma try without it tho
lol gnome is written in javascript
really?
whats typescript?
etcher uses it apparently
etcher is hot garbage
uh
i think it's some typing system for javascript
adds static typing to js
personally akhil
i would stay the hell away from js
just use kotlin if you want js
yea its not the greatest
it can
compile into js
i was considering to just like do it in cocoa and make my life a bit easier
but thats stupid
ill try it after
…
i need something that can be served up using web-view
:( not native mac app pls
no one can use that except mac users
nah dont worry
i aint doing it
also add a safe mode to urs
i want it to be cross platform
?
what would it do
so u cant
flash ur hard drive by accident
oh yea of course
im having it not like recognize ur hard drive
Tf is http/3?
http3
uses udp
etc
Well cloudflare will support next month so
cy made a batch file
and modified his css
and now
all problems are solved.
yipee
my batch script
doesnt
work
its like
the simplest
batch script
and it doesnt
work
a;sdflkaj
hi my name is windows
hi my name is shuf
dinosaurous rex
write
smh
the script in python
no that's a pain
os.system('cy is being a bad')
that's what I do
lol
i just wrote a .ps1 file
and it works
for the linix ppl
just change Copy-Item to cp
and rename it to .sh
lol windows haha funny
where is that
ok now my PowerShell script works
so that is good
so to build the react portion of the app
make your programs more cross-platform
and if you're on linux
you just
make your own
batch file
shell script
cuz if ur on linix
im sure you're capable
no
i hate batch scripts
bash*
i just hate bash
it is the most god awful garbage
then do it manually
it literally
runs the build
then
copies the files
to the right location
yes
python can do this
in
5 lines
and is cross platform
unlike bash and ps
you can make a pull request
if you so desire
ok
i will
l8r
ok
haha yes
i have defeated it
it cannot beat me
you can now
open any code
and it will open
the newly built
codetools-react
that took
a very
long time
so now there are a few things left to do
1. actually make the runner thing work
2. add a ui for managing your content
3. draft/publish functionality for challenges
oh and then the myriad of rate limiters that this thing is gonna need
since what the actual garbage is this
idk i would need to check
and that is cumbersome
spotify's backend is essentially all python
they cite
ease and speed of development
and the fact that all their engineers already know it
no, but i didn't want to
i dont need it
cuz
ios simulator
works without it
the one in xcode?
yeah
cool
i worked on codetools
it like
loads now
the editor
but the login probably doenst work
lmao the page isn’t loading
wait
now it is
wait it just did
Yeah still no signup
i should fix that
idk what ramesh did to it
I put
The variables
In dotenc
that's bad
dont do that
that is good
i will do that
otherwise
imma put it back in the HTML
i have to manually
edit
your code
and I do not
want to manually
edit your code
and then it will break on your end
yeah but otherwise the code is a pain
and then you change it
and then it will break on my end
so just use what i put in
true
ok
RECAPTCHA_SECRET=6LeIxAcTAAAAAGG-vFI1TnRWxMZNFuojJ4WifJWe
RECAPTCHA_SITEKEY=6LeIxAcTAAAAAJcZVRqyHh71UMIEGNQ_MXjiZKhI
that is the test recaptcha
but you can put in whatever you want
also you can add a filter if that makes the code better
i have the actual one
somewhere
cool
but you just
put that in your .env
i have to find it
and fly
k
im studying for a math test
hi it works now
yey
you can see the new editor
Im in pog
can you
change the font
monaco died again for me
with its broken emoji font
ctrl+f5
no
work not
skreenshot
no runner nodes E07
wait i have to start one
it werk in crhome
no me
no me cy
pog
2 on line
ramesh your issue
cy ur load balancer is bad
is a linix issue
or
it works in firefox
just change
the font
it works in chrome
change the font to something that is not the default
please
segoe
it is not the default
does not work
it loads emoji in firefox
can you just change it
it is set to DM Mono
so whaddya want me to do
lol wait
hold on
actually like
fix my font configuration?
hold on
it might not
be
it is not
gimme a moment
imagine conveniently blaming everything on lunix
it is a linux issue
it works in windows
and mac
i think
cuz matt is not complaining
dm mono
is not
on lunix
or mac
no its not set to DM Mono
yes
if it were
i need to figure out what the prop is
i would not have the problem
no actually ramesh
if you had your system configured correctly
it wouldnt be an issue
the only reason im fixing this
is for you
it works
for everyone
but you
it would be an issue
because
dm mono is supposed to be the font
and it is not
true
thus it is an issue
now i need
to identify
the prop
that is used to change the font
lol haha funny apparently 2x = 0.5y so x = y
i see
i fixed it
now
i have to build it
lemme do that
fixed
on the server
if you reload
you will see
DM Mono
yes
also
this isnt a linux problem
then explain
this is a firefox on linux problem
it worked in chrome
same thing
no
also it works in firefox now
yes
i tried to run it on pypy
but i couldnt install cryptography
um
also why is it never using my jrunner
um
i think
its because
mine is first in the set
bad load balancer
and the jobs finish so fast
it just always goes to that one
i mean
this is like
first iteration
of that load balancer
ok
kill ur jrunner5
lets see hwat happens
dead
it uses mine now
cool
yes that part works
its just the preference part doesn't work
i mean
bugs
um
why am i able to access that
oh wait
cuz
its a challenge
oh also yes
the running functionality
is like
bare minimum
ok fine
it doesn't do challenges yet
or solutions
cool
or any of that
lol

"C'est le home staging low-cost"
can someone like summarize what I am saying in this sentence into like 1 or 2 sentences
W1: This is as in the status quo, domestic battery production and research currently resides within a single company, thus not allowing smaller companies to compete with the level of research funding to make better batteries, however when we pass we allow for those smaller companies to gain more research funding so that they can compete with large battery firms
Um lemme try: The current status quo prevents competition in the domestic battery production field, having large companies dominate the sector. By passing (whatever is getting passed), smaller companies gain a foothold into the market with the benefit of an increased research funding.

we must not hate on the school
share it with all your friends
so none of us hear any audio
is that right
yes
none of us do
yup
ok
just making sure
YouTube livestreams do not use any websockets
they use repetitive polling
welcome to google
i called it
i cant hear it
oh wait
i can hear
he started speaking yea
yes

10 seconds ahead

my teachers are just having
just mute your teacher
so im using the link
i did
me too
i set the volume to like
2
…
what is the point of this
it really doesnt matter for guys i think
its just changing the girls white gowns to the same green one
But why?
listen
they are explaining
So why are the only people speaking female?
because there is no change to males
Or "non-binary"
cause it affects them
Yeah, but should male opinion be expressed?
dr lazovick
No
I
mean students
Could I say that by only using female voices, this is biased?
because what would they say
What the females said
they are not affected
they still wear green
I know
it's like
idk what to say
if you are discussing the conditions of African americans
do you go and interview white ppl
No but
if you are talking about a change related to african americans
would you ask white ppl
what they think
if it affects them
so this strictly only applies to girls
ok
this is pointless
why should i watch this if I am a boy
because it is relevant for you to understand
what is going on
why
it doesn't affect me
thus i shouldnt care
no not directly
its like the news
but its a lesson
then
and the news yes
why cant male opinions be said
if it doesnt affect me at all
then
why am I watching this
it does affect me, thus I am watching this
therefore
its a lesson about gender
It does concern me in some way
thus
I should be hearing male opinions as well
Since it does affect me in some indirect way
what would a male say ramesh
i mean they could say the same thing
exactly
it could
inspire confidence
also
why did they choose green not white
for the entire community
i mean if the student president or whatever was a male
then there would be
that poses another problem
cause green is a like a prominent ridge color is it not?
what percentage of the student government is female
true
but what if more people like white
i mean
yea its a valid point ig
white and green are ridge colors
and what if like
males
dont want
green
its not about the color
we dont get a choice
I know
its about the number of colors
yea
what if im a male and i want it to be white
what if they just left it up to choice
i need to pay attention
he talked about this
its more of the idea of unity
there must be tradition and uniformity
I guess
I'm not necessarily against this
its not a bad choice
idrc what i wear on graduation tbh
I think the idea is fine
Wait what did u guys do in advisory bc my teacher isn’t here and I didn’t see it
…
someone else explain this
i dont feel like it
Essentially
the girls graduation gows are changing colors
from the traditional white to the green
same as the guys
Ok thats it?
in order to be inclusive to those that are non-binary/outside the male to female
yup
oh ok that makes sense
Honestly kinda weird in the first place to have 2 different colored gowns
idk its probably to make it look nice
cause during graduation it would be field of green and white
Bruh ridge colors are already so messed up we the red devils but we green
true
i forgot bout the red devils
why
Bc we used to be merged with another school they got the color we got the name
so they are the green devils iirc
also
My arguments (note: please substitute "I" for "binary males") 

1) If this doesn't impact me in some way, then I wouldn't be watching this. Since it does have some impact, it does concern me in some way.

2) Since it concerns me in some way, it does impact me. Therefore, considering that it does have some sort of impact on me (even if it's indirect), there is an impact.

3) Therefore, I should have a voice, since I am affected by this in some way, and I should be able to express whatever voice I have. If there are people who are binary males who do have qualms with this, by having someone from their gender-field agree that this is a good idea might help them feel more confident about the change, so it wouldn't hurt.
I made my arguments more clear
? how does it affect males
The color of the females' gowns changes
which is a visual change
Although that's not the entry point I'm using to springboard my argument
Then what is?
I'm saying that
If it doesn't affect me
then I wouldn't be watching this
So no matter what it is that does affect me in this
If it didn't concern me I wouldn't have to watch it
So are you saying that you don't like they are doing it or just don't care?
No
I'm saying that it's a good idea but
I think when they were presenting it
from my understanding he wants male opinion to be there
They should have had binary males also support it
In that livestream session thing
Although that wouldn't have changed my opinion, I just think it'd have been more balanced in terms of "student voice"
But like what would a guy have said? "We aren't doing anything different."
No
They would have spoken in support of what the other people said
Not talk about the lack of change with males
Like "I think this is a great idea, I've spoken to lots of people and lots of my male friends agree this is more equal and unified than before and helps bring us together as a school."
Also I'm done with this
I gotta start working on emotesui
...
who knew
tf is this for
this is great
should i try this?
Sure
I have a chat I'd like to run this on

The pdf
The short story
I just finished reading the short story
It was rly gud
how long did it take
around 15 mins
I read quickly
that sounds about right
did you notice any discrepancies
and/or did you feel any emotions
Well, we had all these children out planting trees, see, because we figured that ... that was part of their education, to see how, you know, the root systems ... and also the sense of responsibility, taking care of things, being individually responsible. You know what I mean. And the trees all died.
Lorem ipsum carrots
lol
They were orange trees. I don’t know why they died, they just died. Something wrong with the soil possibly or maybe the stuff we got from the nursery wasn’t the best. We complained about it. So we’ve got thirty kids there, each kid had his or her own little tree to plant and we’ve got these thirty dead trees. All these kids looking at these little brown sticks, it was depressing.
are you writing something
no
im reading
for english
which book is this one

idk
wait
i have to fix intelilj first
then i will consider this
i made updates
not right now
I want to fix intellij
but you can stream that
ok
should i re enable deflate
not rn
ok
ok
i fixed it
ok
um
what does that mean
i made
intellij
not be a black screen
wanna try that
no
*sigh
i said
im fixing jrunner
you can show
what you are doing

ok
i like to see what ppl are doing

um
wtf
did you enable
compression
no i didnt
you told me not to
👏
fix it
sorry
i did not tell you
enable it
reconnect
done
ok
now we have error
I think
this may be a reason
the like
compressIfBiggerThan
and yours might be compressing even like if not smaller
yeah
um
or the compression level
just like
might be different
make it compress if bigger than
0
why does it work the first time
um
idk
I set it to 0
try
error
i dont think it should matter what you set the compression to
but
what is your nginx config
i wanna see
one moment
you could view my screen share
...
no
i just
print screen
and it looks good
your deflate settings
not in nginx
its just that
where are your deflate settings
they have to match right
idk
i can check
yes
this
could be a ktor bug
they are in the websockets library
in which case I wanna report it
find out what python does
this may be faster
if I call you
so I may call you
thats not calling though
does it have
voice
no
then

u dont know what could happen
theres like that 2% chance
but since ur still really young the chance is super low

im not allergic to anything in it
Hey guys
aryan wants you to solve this

spotify has run out of music
i have listened to it all
i want something new
Try differentes genres
Spotify never runs out of stuff
idk it has these mixes
and radios
and whatnot
and i have either listened to
or rejected
everything
idk
maybe im just in a bad mood rn
Try punk or rock or blues or jazz
ok
Or listen to like 2000 pop music
lol
i wish spotify had a random song option
so like
you could just
select a completely random song
from their library
That would be cool
Also try movie music
Like the soundtracks
i like movie music
Those aint half bad
what movie
Anything by christopher nolan
ok
Has good music
Interstellar inception all those
Yea those r good

Consider taking a superior course such as Physics.

…
how does this happen
is this like the explosion
no
that building
was built
in 1970
then
in late 1970
there was a war
may I ask
why was there a war
some religion crap
ah
what else is new
and then there was a war
and then the holiday inn in beyrouth died
in fact
Um
…
wait was this even like "built"
yes
it was
just built
that is the 90s
Yes
ok i got some of the dates wrong
"
The hotel was constructed between 1971 and 1974 by Lebanese developer Abdal Mohsin Kattan[1] and designed by French architect André Wogenscky, working with Lebanese architect Maurice Hindié.[2] The 26-story hotel included a revolving restaurant on the top floor, a nightclub on the 25th floor, and 400 guest rooms.[3] It was part of a mixed-use complex known as St. Charles City Center, including a cinema, offices, shops, restaurants, a supermarket. It was constructed on the site of the Hospital St Charles, which had been founded by the German religious order of Saint Charles Borromeo in 1908, but had moved to Baabda, north of Beirut, in 1963.[4] The Holiday Inn opened in 1974, at the height of Beirut's economic boom, when the city was the glamorous tourist center of the Middle East.

The Holiday Inn operated normally for only a year before the Lebanese Civil War broke out in 1975. The hotel was a war zone beginning on October 25, 1975[3] in a months-long conflict known as the Battle of the Hotels, as over 25,000 combatants fought for control of a group of towering luxury hotels including the Holiday Inn and the adjacent Phoenicia Inter-Continental, resulting in over 1000 deaths (many of those who died were thrown from the top of the Holiday Inn)[1] and 2000 injuries.[5] The hotel was seen as a heavily symbolic goal by both sides in the conflict, and fighting for it was fierce, finally ending on March 21, 1976.[6]


The Holiday Inn in 1990
After the battle, the ruined hotel was stripped to its concrete skeleton by scavengers.[5] It became a battleground again during the 1982 Lebanon War. Since then, the hotel has remained a gutted, bullet-riddled ruin, looming over the city. The ownership of the structure is split. The Lebanese company that owns half of it, Compagnie Immobiliere Libanaise, wants to renovate it and convert it to condos, while the Kuwaiti group that owns half of it wants to demolish it and construct a new tower on the site.[5] As a result of the disagreement, it remains empty and untouched, decades after the war and its brief year of operation; due to its strategic location in Beirut's city centre, the ruined hotel and its immediate surrounding ground level areas were declared a military zone under the control of the Lebanese Army, which currently restricts access to civilians.
Hi, I can english
it is still standing there
it "looms"
its like
the tallest building
in the city
have you seen it before
yes
haha
its like
in the middle
the pyongyang hotel is very tall
of the like
but it is unbuilt
nicest part of the city
like it looks great
here
lol
cy's photos
© Cy
its really sad
It's just there
I think they should keep it like this
it is a symbol
right
no
they should
get
rid of it
before
it kills ppl
wdym kills people
by falling down
oh
um
why will it fall down
i may have missed that part
um
because
it has been in ruins
since 1975
so
like
you could gut a building
and it could still be structurally sound
right
yes
you could
but
if it has
bomb craters in it
and is not being maintained
yeah
or they could like
turn it into a war museum
like make it again like this
but not bad
whats sad is like
my mom's parents
were building a house
at this time
they built a house
by the shore
a really nice house
i have a picture of it too
wait when was this
like
in the 70s?
yes
it was actually not completely done with construction
I see
when the war came
it was mostly done
they were still installing some of the inside fixtures
i think my mom has a picture
of her and her brother
in the garage
What happened to it
did it get destroyed
the war came
i mean
not really
it was just
like
it was left
did someone take it
no the came and gutted it
that is sad
like the scavengers
yes
it is sad
so unfair
it was my grandfather's dream
to have that house
he was gonna host businesses in the lower floor
it had storefronts
like
like the ones on the bottom of buildings in cities
it's like that book I read
where they are growing up in south vietnam
and the father has a storefront and has a business
and one day the north vietnamese authorities come in
and confiscate his business
and they are sent to some remote village
where you have to cross a moat
i see
that book was actually great
my mom's family fled to france
it was written by someone's mom
like someone from my grade
and then that kid moved to singapore
i see
im just like
depressed about lebanon
i am like
connected to it
im supposed to care about it
and theres like
no hope
I am supposed to care about india
but i dont
but like
india is a different place
yes
idk
my grandparents are still there
they talk to me
and tell me how bad everything is
is lebanon as bad as the other middle eastern countries
as in like
the ones that are like war
no
its not at war anymore
not like iran or saudi arabia
its just
depressing
is it like
the aftermath of war long ago
yes
recovering
from that
and the recent explosion
and then now theres inflation
and no one has money
and no one has food
How bad is like
COVID-19 ther
about as bad as it is here
um
that is bad
i mean
did your grandparents get vaccinated
yes
which is
mine did as well
surprising
imo
india is supposed to be semi-advanced I think
but like
its vaccine rollout
it's like godawful
idk i just like
maybe
before that explosion
that is becuase india has a huge population
so i cant count
there were nice things about Lebanon
is there now nothing
well
all that nice waterfront
is destroyed
all the old buildings
are destroyed
what about
not beirut
the mountains
are still there
they are the only thing
that remains
can they destroy the mountains
no they cant
luckily
the mountains will remain
they are not ephemeral like everything else
they are permanent
that is good
idk
this takes so long
still less bad than SMS
lol
ill never upload a file to SMS
sms doesn't do files
its MMS
yeah
Multimedia Messaging System
if you dont know
i dont use SMS much
so i forgot mms exists
my parents use RCS
me neither
mine telegram
just those pesky ifone users
i tried to get my parents to use matrix
that did not work
i forced my parents to use telegram
whats funny is like
do they use it with each other
since telegram has all their contacts
no
like
every time one of my friends parents
or my brother's friends parents
or a family friend
or whoever downloads telegram
they get notified
and it gives them more reason to switch
completely
that is good
appparently
rcs is getting
e2ee
what is that
end to end
ah
yes
telegram is
*cough
not
something that telegram doesnot have
well
it has it on mak
but it doesnt work right
matrix does e2ee well now
like actually well
read
telegram is russian
except
not really
pavel is like
cuz like
Durov then left Russia and stated that he had "no plans to go back"[26] and that "the country is incompatible with Internet business at the moment".
kittsandnevitsian
oof russia
you're
durov made vk also
yes
a serial entrepreneur
cereal entrepreneur
also read my story
cheerios
only 12 pages
novel  gold flakes
i dont have time to read 12 pages
i read really slowly
and i have homework
how about
and im sad
you dont read all 12
and i wanna sleep
you read like 2
ill read it at some point
not tonight
maybe ill download it
and read the first line
who should i send it to
your English teacher
no
this one is questionable
why not
if i send this to my engilsh teacher
i dont want
to have the guidance conversation
ok
ok
but like
i mean
read it
i think
you will see why
i may see why
it's "questionable" is how I put it
cy is mentally abnormal
weird things happen in cy's mind
lorem ipsum carrots
no
like
i know
actual weird things
I would like to say I'm the same but I am not
cy is suddenly
scared
of anything
he cant see
closets
walls
like a childish fear
that is interesting
that there is
a monster
in the closet
you should
make a story out of your sudden scaredness
not a monster per se
but
it would be good
you know
I suppose
i could make a story
but
*yawn
"time" is my guess
idk
you should read the first two pages
cy also
is like
when you sleep
there are 2 cy's
cy by day
and cy by night
Ah
well what I do is
I put the thing on my ereader
and i read
cy by night gets depressed sometimes
red
cy by night is really productive sometimes
cy by day is not afraid to try new things
so he does
then
in the night
he becomes depressed
with the new things
he has tried
what does "depression" mean to you
a state
of
low feeling
and hurting
in the stomach
and non productivity
demotivation
and tiredness
and
sadness
I suppose
I described this not badly
in my story
I got many of those points
cy is very tired
I am going to bed
bye
cy wishes to cease this discussion
and ramesh is leaving
so
I should've went to sleep earlier
bye
bye
imma bike somewhere
i think imma go to pleasant valley park
in case anyone wanted to join me
it fits the bill perfectly
will there be a rutgers day this year
i think it's no right
um
its probably no
but i can ask my mom later
i got my first shot
i see
374 days ago
the east coast of the united states shut down
and we think its "only 3 weeks"
little did we know
we would now
be here
getting vaccines
for this
global virus
cy is
doing
chemistry
total ve lewis dot diagram perspective drawing hybridization electron pair geometry molecular geometry
no
bad
*14
ramesh is not tired yet from his vaccine
i see
my left arm
is
weird
but whatever
thats always the case with vaccines
cy is still confused about gatsby
but its ok
he will understand
eventually
U guys feel weird when u get vaccines?
i mean a week ago i got 2
in the same arm
Sometimes it will feel a bit like numbnes, but most of the time i dont feel anything
at the same time
Ah
but like
idk
Which ones do u need that u need 2?
the second one hurt a lot
idk i was due for 2 different ones
Huh
I think im all caught up
one time the nurse like
just
stabbed it in me
like
really fast
that was like
scary
but it hurts less
Ah that’s not great
Idk they never ever hurt
they ususally dont hurt
but that second one
idk
it hurt a lot
idk
and lots of blood came out
That shouldnt happen
my left arm feels restricted and a bit numb
Yea thats fine
cy is so tempted to write his blog with something other than gatsby
but
he refuses
to do that
I just move it extra if that happens
Why do u want a blog?
just because
learning and so forth
you could write your own
in jekyll
i could
ok imma not type
i wanna like
but im not doing that
rest my arm
ramesh was it the moderna or Pfizer
or jnj
Probably pfizer
Not that many places have contracts with jnj
my mom is like
Moderna is 18+ i believe
a little scared of the jnj one
shes in biomed
so like
Cause it has 60-70%
no its like
the mRNA or whatever
Cause it uses old tech
no new tech
Pfizer and moderna use new tech
Jnj is the same as the old ones
Jnj uses 1 dose
oh wait
jnj uses
The others r new ones so they use 2
an
adenovirus vector
not mrna
mrna is moderna and pfizer
Yup
This is old tech
This is fancy new ones
hmm
i see
ook uhh
my arm
is not numb
anymore
ok
do you know any other sixteen year olds who are vaccinated
no
uhm
ok
unsurprising
lol
tbh i wouldnt have bothered
unless my friend told me
he got it
lol
FOMO
hush
cy wants a nice blog
where he can put photos
and videos
and articles
and interactives
he wishes not
114dot7
to be bound
or
by the software
he is using
whatever
wordpress
cy is going to figure this out
he also wants it to look nice
ok
imma read

sdfSDfasdcasdfARQW4R1235TG BdQ ASGVAEWRYAqeJ[ue r;ql2345

the ink bled a little, but it appears to be only due to humidity, since the ink did not bleed to the other side
it is an emotion that cannot be described with words
I sse
normally
i realized i have nothing else i wanna do
and there is autocorrect
mmm
i see
bc it is where we live
well then go buy an eink screen
cuz its battery is at 60% health

it would have 4x as many responses
hm
Tfw when I send my story that has the lines "Girls don't have any sexuality" and "Girls don't have crushes" to a girl
or ive just really ~streamylined~ my stuwudying strategy UwU
21 mars 2021

lol
lol
imma replace the messages in the oracle
i have an export of this chat
from last friday
i export it periodically
read it
ill start reading it
thx
it might be not awful
it might be awful
i read up to the line on page 4
would you like to hear my thoughts
yes
ok so #1
its realistic fiction
it is
which i like
um
that said
i have several concerns
so its very i do this then i do that
very action based
i mean
not too much
but
idk
it just
um
idk how to describe that
so what should it be
theres no
dialogue
ok
its too much imagery
i think
ok
then
there is
several grammatical/typo issues
hmm
ok
word missing
i though i fixed them
give examples
im trying to find them
ok…
i found about 4
ok
but i dont remember where they are
would you like me to continue searching?
yes
ok
idk i found one
the tenses
are
not
but
that is correct
sorry
hes talking about
a past event
but i can change that
it works in both ways
um
ok i mean
there were some other things like this
but i cant find them
ok ill look
dw
so then
what else
um
why
is
the ip address
in north korea
HA
easter egg
lol
thx for noticing that
it was such a minor detail
yw
ok what else
yes minor
ip addresses in stories
are not
minor
to me
lol
to some people it might be
but go on
i dont have much more to say
plot
plot is
um
thus far
not particularly special
yes
only the ending
is special
it didn't like
grab me that hard
although
since its realistic fiction
it was easier to keep reading it
without falling asleep
ah
well if you get to the end
the ending is more special
Maybe ill write some stories
also it's like the kinda predecessor book
to red is blue
the one with the glass cage
and the singing
yes
yes
yes
if you wanna read more go ahead
later
i might read more later
or write my own story
lol
i recommend
reading it more
ok
i want plus feedback
cy wants to make a blog with gatsby
he needs to play with Gatsby more
i could use NetlifyCMS
i needa jacket
one sec
why
is it
that cold?
yes
i just opened my window
im too warm
l a g
?
oh
lag
not Iag
and no thats not lag btw
thats on purpose
oh
interesting
you can change the effect factor
lol no you cant
unless you wanna edit my code
no
imma read
more
bye
bye
should cy make a poprx system
so like
with one line
or 2 lines
of code
on your website
you can add live viewer count
cy is sooooo tempted to not use gatsby
and make his own ssg like ramesh did
cy
is going to use
his own ssg
.
actually cy is still not sure
lol
What is the best free video editing software
Hitfilm Express
i tried a bunch
hitfilm was like
the most
complete
Kk
davinci resolve
yeah i hear that ones good too
cy is stuck on how to make his blog
ramesh is wondering
how he can tell more people that they may be eligible to get vaccinated
even
if they are under 18
i think it is a good idea
Oh god
no cy
ill make my own site
what shouldi i call it tho
vaksine
no
it has to indicate
it is for minors
what is the purpose of the site again
to inform young people
that they too
can get vaccinated if they have underlying conditions
ok so do this
or are obese
make a site
and have it have a dropdown
and a check box
and then
based on those selections
it like
says
yes or no
i was thinking
and which vaccines
i go to discord
they can take
and then
I write a PSA status
then I make my username _xylian
so i appear at the top of the friend list
and then
it tells them
lol
they can
_____________________________________________________xylian
__xylian
PSA: 16, 17,  and 18 year old high-schoolers ARE eligible for the vaccine if you have health conditions!! Check this link to see if you have these conditions: <CDC guidelines link here>. Get a SHOT! IT IS EASY, FREE, SAFE, AND EFFECTIVE. If you need help getting an appointment, DM me for tips.
i want it
to sound like an ad
intentionally
ok
do you think this works
i suppose
although
i dont think its neccesary
there are ppl who need vaccines more
why
than children
true
in virtual school
lol
see
cy wants
i wont be in virtual school tho
lazy loading
on his blog
turbolinks
um
i meant like
if you have a homepage
with blog posts
they load in as you scroll
thats
annoying
but what if i have 100 posts
Boris
Yes
i would
paginate
the vaccine givers are smart
they talk to you about something to distract your pain
this is why getting an nj vaccine appointment is so hard
i did what i wanted cy
about the psa about the vaccine
Yeah
I use it a bit
is it fast?
Based on chrome
now with full contentful support
this
HOW THE HELL DOES THIS WORK IN INTERNET EXPLORER
lol
bet it no work in firefox
whoa
i like css compilers
they solve all my compatibility issues
you just design for chrome
and they fix everything
the backdrop filter is missing a media query
but other than that
I told you
told me what
to use a compiled css
I actually did my work in class for once in my life
the thing is
its just like
css
not scss
css
actually
wait
only the header bar uses scss
the teacher is yelling at the student for using powerpoint
the rest of it is just css
and for once I support the student
lol
the teacher likes laughing at people to make them feel worse
lol
imagine having any emotional intelligence
wait
wait
wait
wait
what is contentful
whats surge doing then
its a static web host
then what is contentful doing
loading in the posts
from the CMS
its a CMS
Interesting
here tell me a post to make
send me a title and a body
and see how fast it appears on the page
Lorem ipsum carrots
Hi im cy i like carrots
done
tf is my right arm hurting for now
ok then
see contentful is good
and it uses GraphQL
you query it
and it gives you your content
yes
um
that was there since 08:08
no i wanted to show james
that you love carrots
lol
im taking it out of context
imma take that post down
down
i got a screenshot
it's fine
guess im not a person
yes i have not added the media query
that resolves that
cool
how do u study for a retake
where
the mistakes you made were legit
6 - 2 = 2
and you lose 5 points
since it's a multiple choice question
im so curios
how
idfk
i practiced my kumon preschool books
for extremely large values of 2
lol
it would not equal 2 tho
YES IT WOULD
STOP
IM AN ENGINEER
lim x → 4 2
IM RIGHT
ah yes round everything up
there was an urban dictionary word on this
something lik ethis
school seems safe
look it's data
oo data
yes i like the data
it's cool
exactly
0% of 16 year olds are vaccinated
6-2 can never = 2
this sums up
perfectly
if it even had with large values of 2
*were
ah this
STILL out of stock
DAMN
it's not as bad but MY MY
holy heck
and good look getting a 5900x
still dead stock
impossible to get
this seems…
legit
does it?
actually yes its good
i would love a dodeca core cpu
i have one
Ooo self hosting paas things
Whats the difference between paas and like saas
paas is like google app engine
where i can run my flask app
heroku
saas is like contentful
where they provide the cms
the hosting
the frontend
everything
Huh
um
wdym by that
like
eaten indoors
gone to a restaurant during the covid-19
pandemic
inside
and eaten
i have not gone to a restaurant during COVID 19
oh
not indoors
ok i think the school is trying to start being lgbtq+/ try to be inclusive
which i dont hate
but i say this because 4/8 fiction books for summer reading focus around the idea of lgbtq
and the nonfiction ones are around systemic racism and sociology
I see
I'm not necessarily opposed to it but it cannot be one-sided
Otherwise I won't like it
my mom got a book in her mailbox at rutgers
about why climate change is a hoax
..
not that
Trumpism
haha
…
idk
"trumpetism"
yes
i want food
This webpage is interesting
I like its design
The US government knows how to make websites it seems
yea its not bad
btw ramesh
has proper use of serif fonts
if you like serif fonts
its not bad
So what I have concluded is that vaccinated people who are dining indoors are being selfish
It will not affect them
But it will affect others
Thus I will probably not do this
cause u could carry it?
you can
the thing is
apparently vaccination will make you less prone to spreading it
but that is not proven yet
ah fck
i have to listen to fire alarms ringing
👏
your parents are cooking?
nope
then why are they ringing
uhh?
hmm?
oh uh fire department inspectors are here
oh
nice
the inspectors will probably come for us like next week
remember that time when the fire ppl had to come to my house
cuz we pressed the "test" button on the CO alarm
ah that was funny
but they usually dont call the fire department do they?
lol no akhil
as we learned
ours doesn't
the hard way
ours dont
they ring all the time
no one ever comes
no we have ones from ADT security
those ring
thats why
yeah
I wonder if there will be vaccinated-only restaurants
nah
mabye the fancy ones
ik my brother will want to go
if u wanna go find a resturant that allows dine in
two weeks after his second dose
i mean you could also take out
and then
go to the park
that would be pretty safe imo
you could probably do it without getting vaccinated
i not only have 1 or 2
but 6 new garbanzos for u
oh HECK yes
ill send em as i finish them
My thanks to you
haha
i cant wait
to see what they r
yes
also i might be busy for a bit since i have to do some more physics studying because idk how to do 6-2
of course
study some kumon books
did the school wifi go down or something?
um
I left school
I know
I was wondering if you knew a person who knew a person
no
my arm hurts less now
?
Idk
the advisory slides
theres advisory?
lol half the class left
so
before I left
and then I left
nonononono
stop
you did?
um
Nice
One of us
they count it for attendance
you idiot
what is a dildo
thats not the insult i meant
actually
you leave after the attendance
yeah
Ours let us go
oh
Like the entire class left
ours did not
they said go into groups and i went into the group myself and i had to have that awkward talk with the teacher
hi
calum's looks th esame
yeah I accidentally overwrote his changes
when I did git pull
he like
changed the font
from DM to Oxygen
lol
Aren’t they already?
No
Huh i remember this was a discussion like 2 years ago or something
Thought it also got applied
no

Voteee
I forgot what feeling dead is like
.skin?
why
.ng would be cool
fair
Tf
whats covid-19?
Idk
all ik is corvid-19
No
Ik theres this thing
Called rhe china virus
Not applicable in the us tho
oh i heard about that on the news
of course
Yeah i was watching fox last night
yes
Man
fox is the best
The media is just lying to us
they always have such good news coverage
Excwpt fox
Yeah ikr
It's so objective
they present it as it is
EXACTLY
And the biased libtard media like the new york times
Just makes up nonzense
the damn democrats
Ikr
going around and messing with everything
Legit like
Even some republicans
Arent strong enough to fight for what we believe in
Like mike pence
that damn mcconnell
mike pence
He let us down man
hes like
a traitor
Ikr
Hes not a patriot
hang mike pence
yes
justice
must be served
Dems will cancel you if you say it
U know that big tech works for the libs
true
we have to break them up
they are censoring us
and turning america into 1984
what has this country turned into
ikr
immigrants are coming in
what is this china?
and my christian heritage
my faith in Jesus Christ
I love those things
no its GODDAMN US OF FCKING A
I know right
it has
AMERICA
AMERICA IS FOR AMERICANS
NOT THE IMMIGRANTS
GET UR OWN COUNTRY
ikr
someones gotta stop them taking our damn jobs
honestly black lives matter is a hoax
along with climate change
legit like just this libtard
"movement"
it's also racist
its all a ploy
since white lives matter too
plandemic anyone?
yes
the deep state just wanted to insert microchips in us
that's why this happened
immigrants brought it the virus in
no way in HELL im getting those vaccines
the government allowed immigration
they knew this would happen
yes if you don't know
Q said they are part of the deep state
why would u get vaccines ever?
ikr
they cause autism
exactly
and now microchips
so now they can control your lives
brainwash you
into becoming a libral
those damn liberals
we gotta fight
no
it's not
liberals
nestle
nestle runs the world
yes
they secretly
control everyone
and the librals
are on their side
no one knows this
they r the librals
the ducks in the park are free
they don't tell you this
nestle = librals
i have 473 ducks
what the media doesn't tell you
the media is controlled by librals
you heard how people just die after getting vaccinated
so it makes sense
cept fox
fox is really high quailty stuff
lol funny
that was like
the book
they r on our side
my mom
got in her mailbox
at rutgers
and she was like
it's true
they are trying to bring you out of the deep state
either that, or just delete this entire conversation
it came with a dvd
i dont want someone in 10 years to take this out of context
and be like
haha
"ramesh is a qanon supporter"
lol
delete it all
here
to this message
thats alot of messages cys gotta delete
we cant delete it
since hes an admin
yea cy has to
i realized that good screwmanship can have sexual connotations
lol
so should we not say it
screwmanship?
screw man ship
ok i may just be really out of it but i dont understand
ok well
to screw means to copulate
so by saying you have good screwmanship
you are saying you are good at copulating with people
something like that
yea but screwmanship is not a word
it is not
it is a cy word
he uses it to describe himself
huh
this makes sense now
I cannot do apush
i have no clue what
but i cannot pay attention
hi and welcome to discord
of course
my mom had better not see that
...
Sweet Home Alabama
who is dominic
is dominic a furry
no
he was a member
and now
do you know what a furry is
um
idk
u dont want to
u do
let me give an example
yea he used it as a noun
here
this was hilarious
i think it's supposed to be cute but it's more funny than cute
yea they overdid it on the uwu speak
idk
yes
use that
in your vocabulary
especially with the ~ around the word
A-akhil pwease ~stweamyline~ uwur cwode!
...
time to bleach my eyes
UwU
no oh god i need more
Hee hee
Past the interludes yet?
uh yea
im where adolin is like learning to throw his blade
without it like vanishing
ramesh
I vaguely remember
can you explain
Also
git
and branches
briefly
calum and I are suffering
Did you get the moash references yet
In a minute
not yet
I have to turn on my computer
not really anyway
At all?
we havent seen moash/kaladin for a while
aka interludes and shallan
ah
i have no storming clue where you are
wheres shallan at
Hmm?
uh she kills Tyn
my favourite
scene
in the book
how does she kill tyn?
and then arranges a meeting with the people who hired her
with a silver(i think) blade
git = version control system

code
you commit code 
committing code means that you basically "save" it as a revision

branches are kinda like different versions of code (and commits happen for the branch that you are working on)
like you might have a stable branch for stable changes, a dev branch for active dev changes, and a feature branch for some additional features 

you can merge branches together, so you could go like feature → dev → stable

for you, you could have a "cy" and a "calum" branch and
silver?
as in color
read the scene again akhil
just go
read it
again
not substance
go read it
ur missing the point
when does mist twist akhil
?
when there is water
that forms a mist
in the stormlight archive akhil
maybe you go read the prologue to the way of kings again
its usually said when like a blade appears or vanish
what kind of blade
...
a shardblade
what else
yes
did you miss that
not at all
haha
how tf does shallan have a shardblade
this is why my favourite scene is this
yea its pretty cool
it comes from absolutely nowhere and hits you like a brick
someone remind me I have my scheduling thing tomorrow
U have ur scheduling thing tmrw, yes u ramesh
calum like
disappeared
like he was editing the app
while screensharing
and then
out of nowhere
the screenshare terminates
and hes offline on discord
his power maybe
went out
hes on a laptop
the internet
true
at least me
but i dont have my xylian account on
my phone
that's weird that his power went out
imma join this
ok
in some minutes mabye
ok
what should I make
right
i was making the yew app
btw akhil yew is confusing
Yea i looked at some documentation
It was weird
Idk imma work on my website
you cant just render a component
Thats weird
ill ask in their discord
YouTube changed their icons
nvm I think
I figured out how to do it
ML time?
i dont feel like learning yew
seed is nice
time to write an emotes API client
either that or I do my apush notes
I just finished apush
im feeling lazy
idk whether to join this devil's quill discord
i never went to any of the meetings
i'll probably join next year
I gotta redo a bit of the notes for the presentations
but still
right this
i forgot that was a thing again
Yea
Its on small sections tho so its fine
Light blue headers
oh ok
i need a new music player
ugh
which of the books were lgbtq books?
uh they have tags when u click on the books
top right, top left, middle left middle middle i believe
in fiction anyway
why are so many of them lgbtq?
or like
its like half of them
yea idk
why cant they do
fantasy
nonfiction has the same thing i think
*sigh
racism and sociology
im not going to choose those
ikr
i see it too much
last year had like fantasy, fiction and stuff
i want fantasy books
fiction books
non realistic fiction
some realistic fictions are good
but i dont like them that much
I just finished one
they r fine
also I just feel like of the discrimination stuff we hear about
no one does it in our community
because we are all rich and whatever
and no one is really racist
so it is very hard to relate
well racist against each other yea no
I believe I already read this
my friend said malcom gladwell is racist
i think i did back in like 7th grade
And I think
he is right
we had this really wack teacher
in some ways
*cough
Why so many
ill put female
no goddamn it i wish there was an airplane
option
or an other option
and ill be like
Other: ATTACK HELICOPTER
"idiots assume my gender but it is AIRPLANE"
TRUE
THEY ASK FOR YOUR GODDAMN EMAIL TOO
WHY ARE THEY ASKING THIS
ITS NOT LIKE THEY CANT JUST GO TO GENESIS AND SEE I AM MALE
What its it for?
idk
like apparently
idk
i usually just say "prefer not to say" but this isn't anonymous
so it's totally pointless
cy
read my story
akhil do you want to listen to most GODAWFUL song
ever
sure
anyone: anything
dji:
tbh
they could be right in some way
what if
they use a new api to query the battery
and it reads the precentage wrong
so it dies before you land it
and then it crashes
like i said
hi im an FPV pilot
although that has nothing to do with the battery
hi im ramesh
im doing my apush notes
my battery
bye
has no firmware
has no computer
ik
i realized
I wanna build an FPV drone
and fly it
it seems really fun
like
there was someone at HackJA
with a tiny little FPV drone
and they were like
flying around
all around us
under chairs
over tables
circling ppl
it was so cool
I wanna build one of those little tiny ones
that you can fly indoors
Uh some batterys have firmwares and small computers
Yes that was cool
I finished my apush notes
nice
i am currently dying
that took a while
because i need to do aphug
yea it was long
it took me like an hour and a half or so

you should write an ap seminar esasy
about the ducks in the park
cy added google analytics
then Microsoft blocked google analytics
too bad
you wont get any
i block them
with ublock origin
so as a result
we must use
cyalitics
use piwik
oh no
stop tracking me
i dont track you
when you go to my website
i just need to know how many ppl saw the site
for the 4h app
use the google search trends thing
thats rpobably
not great either tbh
ideally
what i would have
is server side analytics
so like
it counts
how many views
the page got
yes
do that
but that costs money$
idk why
so you use client side analytics
fine
stop using google analytics though
Gatsby recommended it
*sigh
stop feeding data to google
it's fine tho
i have ublock origin
the thing is like
most browsers block it
which is bad
for me
so i need a better way
same
that is more reliable
its great
cyalitics would be the easiest
but the most prone to attacks
cuz idk how to kode
im watching a video of vladimir putin
driving this like

should I make a sign in system for RCSC
this is going to become a meme
lol
at this point
im like
actually good at web dev
im making another one
mine will be
a barcode scanner
And it will scan barcodes
a barcode scanner
It is the simplest thing
that works on ios
No
they show their phone
with the barcode
where do they get the barcode
email
system
what if
they just
scanned a qr code
and were signed in
done.
no
tried that
i think
this needs some more thinking
lol we might end up with the worlds best signin and attendance system
v3 coming up
Lol no we will make it the club meme
5 signin systems
scattered across the room
no 6
that way it lands on me
no sorry 5
this is real life
we count from 1
I will make 10 of them
i have 473 sign in systems.
my barcode scanner will use
lmao
what the elites dont tell you is that the signin systems at rcsc are free
i have 473 sign in systems.
lol
i mean what i would actually do
is facial recognition
for in person
no thanks
why not
privacy issues
ramesh
there are cameras in the school
watching you
what if youre interested in someone
and you just like
keep taking pictures of them
with your facial recognition software
so you can stare at them
also i dont think it takes pictures and stores them
it stores like
i mean you could
feature ids
take pictures
and store them
i did something like this once
with opencv
and feature mapping
yes but im saying like
you could just as easily
add a line
lol
lol
why are you using underscores
that's more like it
calum came to me and he was like
STOP
PRETTIER
STOPIT
IT CHANGED ALL MY SINGLE QUOTES TO DOUBLE QUOTES
SINGLE QUOTE MASTER RACE
Lol
im effectively making a sign in system
for 4h
with the whole queueing thing
I'm talking to this random kid
ok do that
imma do something else
like my French audio log
and my science studying
im going to try mercurial
oh boy
that chem test
how was it?
not bad
easier than usual
but i had to draw a resonance structure for sno+
thats not a thing
what is Drupal
it needs 17 electrons if its sno+
what time is 2nd period?
ur late
by 4 minutes
nice
you mean 16
no pretty sure its 17
sno- is 18
6+5+6 = 17
but its +
so you -1
so 16
im fckin stupid
i forgot sno is 17
welp thats like 5 points gone
eh
it asked you to draw 2 resonance structures?
3
i have one
N is the central
why?
cause thats what he told us to do
but s is the biggest
idk the question says N is the center
huh
idk i think ill be fine
he prob will give me partial credit
other than that and like some other thing its fine
yea i did that last one
yea thats what i put
so i should be fine
and then 3 on the O?
yea
but O cant do that can it?
i guess it can
it prob can
ok
was it like
screen locked
so you had to have 2 computers
Yes
Well kinda
I just had a vsper chart on my second monitor
I need a jump rope now
I think im gonna do the test on my laptop
that way if i have to draw
i can use my pen
Its easier yea
and then i have 2 monitors for other resources
i swear its like
why
why tf
does it need to be locked
why??
So u dont click out
Aka CHEAT
lololololol
everyone has like
their phone
and their ipad
and their other computer
Yup
Its useless but
What can they do
hi im mrs baker
please collaborate on your test
idfc anymore
Haha
Well now that chem is done
Imma do my website
Its a bit weird
time to make this if
But i really like the design
The fonts on the right are eh
MOBILE CELL PHONE DEVICE

thats a css challenge
and tbh
Yea its like js and stuff
Yup
if ur not making a blog
or something with like
Idk how imma do that text
content or interactivity
just use HTML
its less load on the brain
and more focused
on the design
Well its gonna be interactive i think
how much tho
Not too much
Gatsby is more for larger projects
i wouldnt burden yourself with it for something like this
Well il try
Idk how imma do that left side text
i mean
i can design that
Because its not only sideways
ik how to
But i made them taller as well
by "ik how to" i mean i dont
but if i like
tried and failed
rapidly
i would get it
U could prob get it
Yea
within an hour or so
The question is how to make the text taller
wdym
Ig if i were to say how i did it in photoshop
I made the textbox taller
lol
gimme a minute
So the text inside isnt like “perfect”
Its skewed
Its easier to show what i did
But i have gym
So ill show u afterwards
Ill check in a bit
But its not correct kinda
what do you want?
Ill show u in a bit
Gym
Makes it hard
um
To be at a pc
i have chem
then ap seminar
next period
Ill send after school than
ok
cy is worried
about going back to school
chem is gonna be a nightmare
mp2 i could just like
use my notes
when i needed them
mp4
only ppl at home can do that
mp4 is just ap tests
for me
ok but not for me
i have chem
Uh same for some subjects
Yes
science was a disappointment this year
probably the worst executed class
Physics was fine
right next to math
but math is in a distant 2nd place
ok i mean if i wanna make chem be like mp2
i can just put the edulastic in a sandbox
then itll think im always in that window
what
im just getting mad
hey akhil
did you see the reddit drama
can you please tell me what the reddit drama is
yup
essentially
reddit hired a new mod
its something about aimee challenor
who is a pedophile
yes her
right
yup
so essentially
pernìa
tell me
reddit disliked it
Her husband is a pedo not her but she supports it
so she endorses it
yea so a bunch of subreddits became private
temporarily
yes except
he blocks your screen
so you have to do it on another computer
use hardcopies
why?
protesting essentially
Yeah just print one
i guess il just print one
so
imma have to do that when im back in school
they were protecting her?
The Reddit thing makes you question the backgrounds of the rest of the admins
Like clearly they don’t do background tests
reddit the company was protecting her
ok
why
reddit the community was not
Dozing
Doxing
the really concerning part is like
this person is my brother's age
wtf
this
they dont
thats really concerning
google
anything?
legit like
clearly
isnt she a prominent figure before
like
yup
she got kicked from the green party
she actually banned a reddit mod of a sub
Yeah she ran for something in the uk
how
old was she
when she ran for something in the uk
since she is 23
rn
because they posted her support for pedophilia or something in r/ukpolitics
…………
ok
bad
Then Reddit banned a mod on the sub who made a post about it
has the entire story
ok then
she has a husband?
it said
yea
she was polygamous somewhere
idk bout that
idk
man this stuff is concerning
yea
how do u not
do a background check
ig the doxxing is also concerning
nice
I did kem
kem was ok
there were a few I was not sure about
but I think im good this time around
i didn't have to decode LateX on every other question
Cool wallpaper
^^ a story
Advisory question: what do you think this person is doing
Answer: they are in advisory
Advisory at warp speed with Mr Y and Mrs Collins
has now completed.
Imagine having advisory today
imagine having forgot that cohorts are not a thing
Well no our teacher said no advisory
So
We havent had advisory in the past 3 months besides that one gown color one
chem in person is easy
like u kno the info
instead of watching video
wdym
ah
cuz cy was talkin about chem
does he leave the constant or whatever
also igtg
on the cabinet
ok
cuz 1205
mean bye bye
okko
im going to learn julia
I want to do some data manipulation stuff
I need to learn how to bspwm
I have to legit like read the manpage
ugh
lol
when you see this too much on hacker news
hey cy how does signing work
wdym
actually no
just
ignore this
k

cy play a song
cy is not
cy
come to comp cy club
cy
you both will miss all the offcier announcements
so ok
delete
i have to make a bridge out of arms
photoshop does not like having
700+ layers
OH GOD
what is that
its getting harder to move things
a bridge
pillar
out of arms
you know what cy's gonna do
i have to make the entire bridge out of arms
hes gonna stream data from a websocket
to an http request
oh nice
so what this means
is you can easily host a file
from your web browser
but
you can download it
and use it anywhere
like a regular http file
like
there is a server
that translates the incoming data from websocket
into an http response
which is cool
also i might write my own proxy system
to bypass the school firewall
once and for all
Nice
1500+ layers
lol
Photoshop wont move
Its super slow
Its crashed 3 times now
2000+ layers
I think i broke photoshop
lol
cy is writing a proxy system
Finally
ill send it to you when its done
so you can bypass
the school firewall
What is a scratch disk
Can apparently thats full now
idk akhil
Im 2500+ layers in
Im going further
Further beyond
imma eat dinner
bye
Have fun
you too
Ok i had to delete it
It took
100gb away from me
My storage went from 110 gb left

I have to

Cy
read my story
I do weird things with the chat history dataset
is ramesh coming to apcs
Yes
Dont go to sleep at 2
Nice one
lol at least not on a week night
i do that on weekends
cy
you dont
know
the data was really cool
?
the data
wait
data
wait
ok...
it's sus
btw do you want a copy of among us
no
lol
that must be
really really relevant
Bright Lifestyle
quelques partes de les données est en français
cdknight: some of the dataset data is in French
sonts
lol
de les
is that right
some parts of the dataset is in french
Lol
i mean some bad enlgish speakers would do that
who is someone
is it me
what
where
do not open hexedit on your numworks
it like
causes a fault
resets
how did you
open hexedit
by installing it
from the omega apps thing
lol
why
idk i installed all the apps
yea ik
it just crashes
I need to regex the message strings
i need
an sd card
and ideally an hdmi to wii converter thing
i want to use my wii
ooo someone saw my issue
that i raised
I actually
did do the same thing
how to you use those game simulators on the numworks
ask akhil
hola
how to you use those game simulators on the numworks
cy
no not cy
akhil
tell him how to
you have to do something with the omega app installer
oh yea i was in class
so essentially
when u install the apps
there is a choice to install like files or add them
so u just add a rom file
then install it
um
i didn't see that
hmm
where u install the apps
ok
that unofficial repo
ok
u have to be careful tho to make sure its not a large file
otherwise the installer kinda throws an error at you
not quite sure how i got that picture
um
its a picture
of the camera
yes
but its broken
in pieces
so how did u take the picture
idk
it may be a different camera
no that picture
also it has gps?
yes
intresting
idk what u would need it
except metadata
to geotag
yes
geotagging is really nice
its not bad
idk if the dslr does it
i got the camera for free
it does have a fancy thing
from the woman
down the street
where it adds the aperature of the lens it uses and the settings taken on it
nice
my dads dslr does geotagging
i think
i think mine does it as well
but it uses my phone
i have a Nikon that does the geotagging itself
i also have a nikon
so ig it does it itself
well it has to have GPS
^^ that nikon
this is an offtopic thing
but it's just me right
I just
i hate this kaomoji → ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
lol
Just u
lol
tbh
it makes me feel uncomfortable
i kinda dont like it either
I dont mind it at all
it feels really like
passive-aggressive
i just thing is like
weird
im weird
It's like
a more aggressive way to say idc
like "I really don't care, **ck off"
Well isnt it idk
no
i read it as
ok could someone here please give me their opinion of the styling
this
Meh
and tell me why
this drop shadow
is awful
how could it be better
not having a drop shadow that is as
black
and maybe more "spread" out
like it extends further
i see
what do you think of no drop shadow
remove it
im lazy
well see heres the thing
calum wants no drop shadows
yes
but that looks like it came straight out of 2013
yeah
im with him
no
the drop shadows
look like 2013
2013 was the year of flatness
no drop shadows is the way
flat is good
"flat is justice"
see heres the issue
design trends
are not flat
right now
they are going
anti flat
flat looks old
in fact
i kinda want a like
people are sort of like
windows 95 look
ngl
going back to a sort of
no like
pseudo-skeumorphism
exactly windows 95
i want to make my desktop look like that
that would look cool
as heck
its a matter of what u prefer
even windows 95 has drop shadows
i like minimalism and flat
but if its gonna be flat
then the color scheme needs to change
I like
the thing is like
if you want everything one color
white
or a specific shade of green
you have to have some way of defining boundaries
which is done with drop shadows
if you dont want them
you either use borders
which dont look good on mobile
or you use a different color scheme
that permits you to define borders without shadows
I need more feedback on this
i told you
i like the rest
what do you like in particular
the logo
the boxes
the font is fine
i just
really dislike the drop shadow on the menu
it looks really out of place
and what did you suggest
this
looks really fluid
and consistent
and I really
like it
you know the cards also have a drop shadow
also remove this
they are
barely visible
so it's fine
put it in light mode
that's the mode ppl will see it in
stil
remove the drop shadows in light mode too
hmm
also this looks nicer
than
putting it in the center
or maybe put it in the center
and make the title larger
ok that was calums idea
2em
to make it small
and in the center
i actually
bad
wanted it to be like
dont listen to calum
in a box
so like
hold on
no
Like this
But with a thin line after the title
Like markdowns —-
yeah
thats good
this is how i had it originally
it's better
but I prefer akhil's
the problem is like
the title of the post
and the heading
of the content
idk
i still have to work out the whole thing with posts
Dont have the title and the heading be the same size
the thing is this
i gtg
the post
u guys keep discussing
bye
Adios
the post
has
2 fields
title
and content
and the content
can contain headers
okay
so i wanted to separate out the post title
but
idk
yea so have the title be larger than headers
right align and have a thin line after it
But the title might be really long
right align?
i meant left
left align
yeah definately not center
a title should not be long
but its not neccesarily the post title
it can be like
the post "name"
yea the name should not be long
like here
Welcome to the 4H Fair App
is content
and its more important
than the post name
which is welcome
then u should not have a post name
the most important should be at the top
and largest
thats just how it has to be
huh
ok
it doesnt look right to go small, large then back to small again
it should taper
large, medium, small
i see
ok now what about the colors
and the shadows
and all that
colors r fine
idk bout shadows
some are okay
see i was the other way
i was like
the shadows are good
but the colors
are bad
well i mean what colors would you want to put?
well the main thing is like
the header bar is green
i would normally make it white or black
yea that works
based on the theme
but this is 4h
so we wanna make it green
yea leave it green
but then that makes everything 5x more difficult
because
how so
like
if green is your accent
you cant put green
on green
your accent in the header bar has to be white or black
yea so have it be white on light mode
and black on dark mode
i mean that's what we have now
yea thats fine
this is what we had before
yea what u have now is fine
there is another thing
but its kinda small
and only on dark mode
which is the post color and the background color are a bit too similar
they post color should be a bit of a lighter grey
so it stands out from the black
but that just might be my monitor
or should the background just be black
never have the background be just black
that honestly looks awful
i mean here it does
darker greys
idk
make things look a lot nicer
off-black is a bit weird
i avoid black as much as possible
especially on cheaper monitors
its way too harsh
like when i have a white background
and black text
that works
i prefer not black
like
but the inverse does not
this is not black text
its a bit of a greyish
dark grey
put it in dark theme
theres an option at the bottom
idk i find that a bit harsh
it must be me
i like harsh things
i dislike this the most
the apple webpages are bad
the black ones anyway
i liked the white with grey accents
see what i dont like is when ppl call something a "dark theme"
and its like
light gray
light gray is ehh
i prefer dark grey
discord is an example
discord's theme is not too bad
its not a dark theme really
their light theme is bold
i like it
yea its not a dark theme but its good
but the thing about their "dark" theme
is like
its a bit unique
cuz its not entirely gray
its sort of
purpley
its not actually gray
its like
very very mildly blue
Yea
But it fits the aesthetic
it does
but also
it gives them room
to go lighter
and darker
Exactly
that was the one problem with my black theme sites
i couldnt go darker
which i didn't need to most of the time
but
sometimes it would have been nice
like to have a drop shadow
or something
when you go black though
then drop shadows are not needed anymore
calums list of gross things
How
Does he hate
Pale colors
he likes
everything
Pastel/pale colors are nice
gray and vivid blue
with no variability
no shadow
no color
no themes
Why would u go vivid blue
nothing
With grey
Go pastel blue
With grey
That looks awesome
pastel blue
Also serif is fine if its used properly
Thats a pastel blue
Idk what that is
this is what he things of serif fonts:
Oh god
That quality
see there are different styles
vercel uses a flat with outlies design
which i consider modern
Which is nice
Yes
then there are designs with drop shadows
Minimalism is the best
Nothing fancy
white and drop shadows
which is
a little dated
but
still modern
then theres pseudo-skeumorphism
which is the new trend
If done correct
Um
Correct me if i am wrong but that means is just using like real images almost
pseudo
fake
The actual counterpart to the design
I mean just normal skeuomorphism
yes
but this new
sort of
thing
its like
material design
but
less flat
and less materialy
its like
interesting
idk
Its off center
Which is pissing me off
its Art
Why could i not have just stood in the center
And taken the picture
lol
Granted there has like a million people there but still
were
Same with this one
Why do i shoot pictures
Off center
I also didnt hide the desk well at all
Hi im Intel
i will now manufacture arm chips
im that desperate
please
help me
im so desperate im even asking TSMC
to help me
omg this is the funniest thing
Yay
roket
*rokit
lol;
im sorry go back to school
you need to learn
to spel
it was like joke spell
jeppy is also good at joke speling
he has very good gramer
who is jeppy
JP
jp
from 4h
ooooooooooooo
brain
cy is now accepting POST requests
what
you wrote
your own
http server
lol yes
what language
python
and also does it have a byte limit
like
but imma probably rewrite it
in like
how many bytes do you read from the tcp stream
go or something
this
102400 rn
Lol
but
to me
it will become infinite
i really want to know
how to make it infinitie
how do you know
when to stop
do you know
im working on it
this is a special http server
that will allow a browser
to fulfill a get request
by sending a POST request
i think i already outlined this
thats a bit
confusing
the idea is
it acts as a relay
and
it will send a message to a web client
via websocket or something
and then the client
will POST to the relay
the data it wishes to send as a response
and that will be relayed to the user
btw i also wrote a websocket server
from scratch
so i might use that
although websockets are a bit annoying to deal with from scratch
im not too sure
im dealing with discord rn
ok
im listening to a French song
from our French Manie Musicale
that i liked
im listening to a japanese music soundtrack
it's mostly classical
"classical"
aka
not lyrical
it's not electronic
yesterday i got an http request to be answered through websocket
but
it was like
bad
and complicated
i have an image
it is 29 KB
then
i have the same image
and its 44 KB
its time to figure out where it becomes this big
first it is on my pc
then i select it
in the browser
then it is read by a FileReader
then it is POSTed to the server
then it is received by another browser
then it is downloaded
literally gnome animations are macos
from that browser
i have a feeling its this step
because the js prints out the file
on the screen
and it says 44.6 KB
im making the rcsc sign in system rn
do you know how it will work
any idea
um
it wont
i totally understand
because we're at home
next year
i will have to search through my photos for a barcode
no
that is scrapped
it will not be doing that
ok then
um
idk
i mean
i think i already postulated my ideas
it will use a pi as a wifi ap
oh no
lol
and then what?
google oauth
as a captive portal
and then
so every time
it restricts the wifi range
i enter the comp sci room
i have to
yes
switch my wifi network
:D
and lose connection
for a few seconds
then go through a captive portal
yes
then disconnect again
and reconnect to the main network
tell me how to implement security
without this
um
im not sure how like
if you gave me a moment to think
i could probably find
a much
much
i spent an excessive amount of time
better way
thinking about this
ok you do your thing
im making this
becuase I want to
i mean
everyone keeps telling me that what im doing is a waste of time so it's not like it makes a difference
everyone = more than you
i mean
im not saying the learning is a waste of time
but like
i dont think that's a good solution
to sign in
a better solution
is just
check the ip of the requests
and if they come from BTSD
then they're good
if you want more
add a qr code in the classroom
and google sign in
No
Because
Someone in BTSD
Not at RCSC can sign in
And that is a problem
but they need a qr code
No
which is at btsd
I can
Send my friend
The QR code
but they are on the bus
going home
they are no longer at BTSD
No
I can
Sign in on behalf of them
you need their google account
Also
That requires hosting
yes
And im not hosting anything online
why
This one requires no public hosting
It is cheap and maintainable
so is serverless
Im not interested in this
idk i think like
it would be faster
and more secure
for someone
to just
take attendance
Idc
ok then
go do that
alternatively if you're being really cool
and want a hardware solution
with no hosting
use the Bluetooth tracking ids
that come from ppls phones
No
Then
I have to write an app
no
Pwas
they are already being broadcast
What
Tell me about this
like for that coronavirus app
Ok...
i believe the phone is listening/broadcasting
with a mac address/unique id
Hmm
that you can ping for
Ok this is good
ik iphones are explicitly listening
Android?
not android tho
they dont scan continuously
is there like
some documentation for this
imma look into it
i am purely speculating
it may require an app
or you could just have ppl install COVID ALERT NJ
lol
no
if it requires an app
then it is not possible
the wifi ap is an extra layer of security
and i can have the password change each week
since android has that qr code wifi thing
wdym android
only samsung
or oneplus
no
android has it
to read them tho
iPhone and android
can do it
This
alternatively
i can use webrtc
somehow
ok no
webrtc?
no
yeah
I agree
that requires hosting
no
it's p2p
right
but it still requires hosting
why
for the signaling layer
nvm then
no
Pi
pi indeed
cy might figure this out with an ESP32
but first hes actually kinda interested in that Bluetooth thing
he just has to find a third jumper wire
Yeah i am too
so he can serial into his pi
Ça
Ramesh for once did not fail a Physics thing
yeah uh
idk
about
the Bluetooth thing
devices have to be listening
and discoverable
i gave up on nixos
i believe Telegram uses rlottie for its fancy animations
are rendered by a wasm compiled version of rlottie
hi my name is samsung
i name an animation renderer
rlottie
im still dealing with this idiotic nixos thing
i have concluded
that running nixos on a raspberry pi 4 is impossible
i will now try a pi 3
why
because
and next time imma buy something that works
because?
because
The end
lol ramesh and his explanations
you know what i need an explanation for
Lol RCSC Meeting Reminder
whatever
what
the fork
why does telegram own a virtual ISP
on that island
oh
since durov like has a citizenship there right
near that island
huh
im looking up ips
is hosted on
Google Cloud
im like what
how
whats weird tho is like
its all the way in kansas
google doesn't care about speed clearly
is hosted on
Akamai
um
I need a new google voice notification number
gimme a site
i want a site
that's not on cloudflare
that i can look up
um
yes
ik
or
Linode
ramesh
wait
i think
that is on cf
yeah
ok dont do that
that one was a bit more complicated
hmmmmm
Vercel
ew
lol
data cynters
vercel is hosted on Amazon
bad
lol so does netlify
not Surge tho
they're on Digital Ocean
lol
they host themselves
on their own isp
good
yeah since
they are an isp
lol
but now i know why surge a little slower
they are all the way
in California
ok how about like
lol they are hosted by the Chinese Communist Party
on nginx
hmm
thats taking a while
i see
yeah its really slow
Ryugyong-dong
is their ISP
what is that
in north korea
haha
now we are getting into Very Evil Territory™
China is evil
lol
and then theres north korea
where
china is considered
freedom
lol
yes
lol i just realized
the screen
is falling out
of my iPod touch
the battery swelled that much
like if i turn it on
i can see light through the gap
in the side of it
How to do screen replacements 101
wait for the battery to swell so much
the screen falls out on its own
im starting the wifi ap stuff now
finally
that took
in south korea
those 2 have such similar names
dont they get along?
they dont
north korea
lol
calls itself
조선국
Yes
and south korea
lol
cyfinfaza: lol
oops
한국 for south korea
조선국
cyfinfaza: Chosun country
yes
한국
cdknight: Korea
조선국
cyfinfaza: Chosun country
wait
초선국
cdknight: A super-selected country
no
it's this
wait
is apple hosted on Google Cloud
wow
their IP leads to the same geographic location
as Google Cloud's main hub
in kansas
haha
try like
wgetting that
that's like
what cyserv  relay returns
cyserv relay has tried to send images
but it always fails
it something to do with string encoding
idk what tho
cuz its not supposed to encode or decode anything
Vercel
no
look at the page
lol
interesting
who is
alex strasser
made the app
for 3 years
then graduated
is he an adult
hes in college
he
used cordova
or whatever?
yes
Ionic/Angular/Cordova
that stack
is he german
um
idk
strasser
sounds german
his mother does things at 4h
Laura Herndon
shes a volunteer
i think
btw
when cyserv-r is done
you will be able to use it
to send files on Discord
i mean
how
wdym
i can use
any web server
for that
its not a web server tho
so if you have a really big file
it doesn't have to upload first
so like
IPFS
yeah
but less stupid
but with a relay
yeah
ok i see
ipfs is not stupid
its just
complex
ive been going at this since 3
you know what cy hasn't done
I have calculated the proper throat and chamber diameter for my rocket engine
I see
on paper?
yuh
um
this is one part
use a komputer
mah
nah
cuz like
its esier to b orgonised
and the math was not hard
yeah then i guess its better
it was the consistant guessing and check
but like then you can make a parametric system
where you just put stuff in
and a throat and chamber diameter come out
ggrjklsgajkljkfjkl'gf
why did I spend so much time on this
ugggggggggggggggggggggggggg
cy has to do the Animal Picture Lab 3.0
he hasn't opened it yet
that is easy
lol
just turn it in and mrs tan would like grade it a week from now
no one
is ever productive
in apcs
lol
true
like
i wanna make cyserv-r
mrs tan wants me to help people
but
i cant really do that
if no one is doing anything
lol
you can, however
help ppl with APUSH
I can
but
that is because they
i come to class with questions on stuff i did the night before and once that is done i do nothing
want that
I have a 7
wdym a 7
97
ooooo
in hush i have a 92 cuz my teacher has NEVER givin anyone an a
who is ur
like no one has ever gotten an a- or higher
teacher
bodine
ah
I had her in 9th grade
so yeah sounds right
Zande is a reasonable teacher
I have Zande
he can give you a B+
or a B
or an A+
based on what effort you put in
my problem is like
for some projects
i kno so much history, it is sad
the highest
he will give
is a 95
cuz when i procrastinate i just watch history videos
like its out of 95%
bruhh
cy has to copy and paste
all his APL 2.0 code into APL 3.0
i prob spent like 30-45 solid minutes on APL 3
i see
so u could prob get it done in like 15
so i could do it in like 20
i dont think we ever did APL3
were doing that rn
you were in skool
she said
that
normally we wouldnt
Next.js
is
wait i could not read rameshes message. I gotta go back to kindergarden
Vercel
carrots
carrots
lol
lol
thats what i was alluding to
softwhere for political campaings is like supa lucrative
jaaavaaaa wotnotnotnt wrowrwrwork
replplplplitttt
just
like
where is the reboot button
ramesh
how do you restart linux
without the restart command
wdym
like kexec?
she
had a thing about this
in google classroom
hmm
lemme look at it
lol ok now it works
*yawn
music player in the terminal
why do you even use a DE
you could like
just use a terminal
and be done
you cannot browse the internet
or use blender
also
i dont use a de
i use a wm
yeah whatever
same thing
not
whats the difference
I see
so like
its less integrated
*yawn
cy is almost done with apl3
yes.
cyserv-r has sent an image.
lol
Futura is a font
Tablet
🤔 something was deleted
and matt deleted it
i see you typing
Telegram is broken it always says I have been @‘ed
So I tried @‘ing myself to fix it
It did not work
hi im ryan lee
i steal code
cy is going to buy an FPV drone
and a transmitter
and goggles
ooooooo
aren't those like
hard to fly
and do the big crash
yup
im getting a little one tho
its called a Whoop
well
whoops are like really tiny
this one is a little bigger
and it uses brushless motors
so its a power whoop
yea, ive heard of those they are sometimes called mini whoops right
yeah
theyre like those toy drones
yuh
I wanna build one
but with fpv
except
this one
has brushless motors
wait
for High power
and flying outdoors
how that able to supply enough voltage
theyre like
to brushless motor
reallly tiny brushless motors
also it can run on either 1s or 2s
yuh but still ur gonna need like a small lipo
yeah
it uses a small lipo
ok
so then it like bigger then a mini whoop
i need goggles tho
yeah
ooooo
what about
a little
like
the dji ones
nooooo
too xpensive
but cool
idk theres DJI FPV
there is
but its $1400
yuh
and everybody hates it
wait
why do ppl hate it
cuz like
its kinda like
a middle ground
between an expensive photography drone
and a racing drone
but like
its kinda the worst of both worlds
rip
its not bad like
if you just wanna do like
cuz what I saw about the dji ones
fast cinematic fpv
was that they were rly easy to use and integrate into drone
yeah
wait
wait
you mean the dji like
stuff you put on your own quad
or the full on DJI FPV drone
no like stuff u put on quad
oh those
also I gtg cuz perod end
like their digital transmission systems
period
ok
DJI is still too expensive
im looking for a full package (drone, tx, goggles) for less than $200
ha
that is like impossable
its not
well
i mean
i think my full price is gonna end up being around $225
+tax
the drone is $95
with batteries
and a charger
act here is one for less
nvm
thing is like
i want good stuff
so im not getting a bundle
im buying each thing individually
bruhh
that means more monee
m AAAAAHHHHHH
im getting a Mobula 7
that is a week ass drone
LiteRadio 2 SE
not the mobula
and some goggles
but the one I sen
t
yeah
um
cyyyyyy
its weaker then the one I sent
apparently really good controller for the price
like
this is the cheapest controller out there
but its not bad
and it charges via USB-C
ive seen that
somehow
and it works as a game controller
for flight sim
bruhh
that means
that it dosent work off of rf
and is super week
no its like
really powerful
100mw
on the SE version
bruhhhh
ppl say it has really good range
like
the old one
with 80mw
had really good range
it runs a special version of OpenTX
that you can configure
that's how they cut the costs
they remove the screen and all that complexity
and just put it on the computer
so you plug it in to configure it
wait but how do they pair the open tx softwhere with the drone fc
you press the bind button
on the controller
theres like
huh
a binding procedure
wait
then ur gonna hav to buy a separate reciver
it works with FrSky, Futaba, and Bayang
or that comes with the drone
no so im buying the drone
that has dmr communcations protocal
with no transmitter
just batteries
and a charger
then
i buy the tx
then i buy the goggles
u need a tx with dmr protocall
dmr?
its FrSky
digital microwave raido
um
they are all that
its just the modulation protocol
most things are FrSky
does it have a video transmitter already?
no so
that's separate
the drone has a video tx
which is just the standard analog
and you pick it up on goggles
yea ik
wait so what was your question
what tx are you buying
im not, for the video
the drone is prebuilt
it comes with one
preinstalled
?
no that's for the sticks
like the controls
yea so just a controller one
i have to buy a controller
and goggles
i think the terminology is like
tx/rx
and vtx/goggles
yea u prob can get cheap goggles and stuff
im having trouble finding good cheap goggles
theres the ones from betafpv
but some guy said they were bad
but theyre the only ones around $50 with diversity and dvr
u can always upgrade
yeah but like
i dont wanna spend much money
for now u can get cheap ones and upgrade them later
he said they had like
latency
and im like
that's not good for a beginner
but imma go see more reviews
to validate his claims
yea
im trying to build like a photography drone
but it expensive
yeah...
and if it crashes...
tbh
if you want photography
just get a DJI
they are awesome for photography
and reliable
and all that
they're not fun to fly
yea
but they take real good pictures
and they dont fall out of the sky
unless you are michael
by not fun i mean easy, but not amusing
yea
Put a 360 cam on the drone u make
akhils or mine
Either
mine is a bit small to take anything
Imagine putting that vid in vr
lol yes
ill get a 5 inch at some point
like ill build one
and ill put a 360 cam on it
Yea thats nice
Also mavic air 2 is 800$
Why
the whoops are too small to take anything
lol
xpensive
but less xpensive
Yea a 5 or 6 should be fine
than your own drone
Well fpv is like 200
not a nice photography one
Yea
It has a ehh camera
have you flown a drone akhil
like either a dji
or an fpv
other than our drone project one
Not a dji or an fpv
Ive flown drones tho
Just like cheapo ones
like those toy ones
from Brookstone
Yea
you can try my DJI
you will see why its really nice
and why its hard to beat that
with a self-built
Yea
Dji mini 2 is 500$
yeah
the thing is this
i would not buy a drone for photography
unless
you have lots of places to photograph
and if you go places
well i mean i do go places
cuz what ends up happening
is it just sits there
unused
yes
hmm idk
i may build an fpv
but i want photos
ik
the fpv like
you can get
well
so
i would start with a small one
that way if you hit a tree
it doesn't like
blow up
and start a wildfire
well if i do it imma do the simulators first
then i would get one
there are "HD" variants of the small ones
which can record digital onboard
they cost a bit more
but the quality is still
rather meh
it depends what you wanna do and what your budget is
5-inch with a gopro is like
the best
yea
but xpensive
idk you can borrow my Spark if you wanna take pictures
that way you dont have to buy your own
frankly
the town library or whatever
should just have some drones
that ppl can check out
i mean i could
but i am going on a trip for spring break so i would like to either make or have one then
yeah
i would probably not want you taking mine
for that long
yea exactly
idk if you have budget buy the DJI mini
its not a bad drone
ill tell you how FPV goes
yea
but i dont think its gonna be a quick and easy thing
its gonna take a moment or two
to learn that
it wont
oh mavic mini is like 400$
qwality video
where u goin
mega qwality 10/10
100/10
true
you should come over and see my spark tho akhil
before you buy a DJI
yeah you can go refurbished as well
cy this gonna b better then fpv
noooo
yuhhh
fpv is much different
mabic mini
is like fast
and spinny
yeah but can it do flips
no it cant
rip
also is it fpv
but it hab gud cam
no its not
u could prob make it fpv
the main thing with the fpv drones
is the analog video
oh
yes
or digital
thats nice
but it has to be low latency
wait cy do u still have the drone escs and motors from last summer
yeah
imma use them when i build a 5 inch
when u go to skool next mp can u bring them
i was gonna use them to build bigger drone
yea get a nice frame
no i was gonna do that
i hav 3d modles
idk i bought them
so i wanna use them
wait i bought the motors and escs
um
i dont think so
i did
i think you bought the RC
which i gave back
lemme check
the rc and escs and motors
i have a spreadsheet
yuh im glad we hav spredsheet
lol waidaminet you did
yuh
ok i giv back
dere b no rush
but like u say ur gonna b in skool mp4
but if i giv back
you have to replace the wire u broke
on the FC
ok
what wire i bork
cuz i forget
lol
hold on
so i can get new one
im trying to find the link
but they are really hard to find
there were 2
this is one
ok
you cut the wires off the other one
yuh I rember
cuz i rember those wires were like not needed, do u still need dem
yeah
ok
i need them to be able to access both ports
i will find replacement, if not i will buy new fc
ok
i mean i can try and find the replacement wires
since i have them here
but thx
np, i bork, i fix
ok
I think I found it
is it an 6 pin or 8 pin connector
8 pin
also that looks like the right one
idk how u find that so fast
WTF is that link
i have no clue
i heard of that one
its not a quadcopter tho
its a plane
so like
yea
idk if you want good pitchers
get the DJI
secondhand or whatever
yea probably
also you should come over
im lookin at some old mavic pros
and try mine
before you buy
try mine and imagine it was yours
and if you crashed it it would be your problem
haha
then you will see
that maybe
idk
i can tell you
i regret
that purchase
it was way too much
for what i got out of it
lol if you want we can go to the drainage pit
by my house
and you can fly it
or i could come to yours
yea it is expensive
i might honestly
just build an fpv
and if i want pictures
use my camera or mount a go pro on it
yeah
the thing is the fpv and the dji are very different experiences
like
you cant look down
with an fpv
unless like
you point the camera down
before takeoff
yea
idk i shall look into it
also its hard to take pictures
because like
you have to worry about flying
all the time
and not falling out of the sky
so you can have another person
with a live view from the gopro
who takes the picture for you
betaflight made an android app
so you can configure your drone
whilst you are out and about
without your laptop
Ooo thats fancy
what i dont get is where they get enough money
for all those drones
i mean that wall goes on
they all have these walls of drones
I am adding a free illuminated button to my order
the question is
what color
its either gonna be green or blue
but i need to make a decision
yes i want a free strap
more decisions
음식은 맛있어
cdknight: The food is good
ok
ramesh
what size strap
should i get
250
i think imma get the 225
ok
the Numworks doesn't have a headphone jack
its so annoying
everyone is copying apple these days
...
Why would u want one
On a calc
the TI has a headphone jack
i really should have bought a ti.
i am now really sad.
Yea but for what purpose does it serve
idfk
Get one
like
oh wait
i remember
its like
you can plug 2 of them into each other
and send programs and stuff
Intresting
So not a useful thing in everyday use
lol no
It a pidgeo
ramesh remembers this picture
cy just spent $200 on drone stuff
Nice
pidgen
its not actually a pigeon
google Lens identified it
but i forgot what it was
ramesh remembers
I do
media makers
we had to do stuff there
and you made it at media makers
i did
Let's play kicker king since apparently telegram can 🅱️imessage
Cheating rates drop to 0%
geez
next thing is like
"Stop world hunger"
world hunger rates drop to 0
she -3 from the denominator of the scores
so i went from a C+ to a B
Nice
I found out numworks has a store button as well
Which is convenient
lol how else would you use variables
Idk
the new numworks actually says sto->
not just ->
Yea
I need to update my calc
no like the physical hardware
the button
Yea the button says that
Im just saying i should update my calc
i need to listen to her talk about 3 dimensional vectors
bye
I forget if i go back to epsilon and update or just update omega
Have fun
ah
amazing
ik
so amazing
its amazing
just change the z index
?
and ur good
how does one change the z index
in the css
yea i see
whats a good value?
um
z index those works and about me to like
20
like the boxes they are in
not the text
that didnt fix anything
what
ngrok
i wanna see
um lemme see
or vs live share
either works
ill vs live share
thats easier
ok
that should work
its probably formatted awfully
i started testing on it and it ended up being this
im examining it
want me to share server as well?
that should allow u to view the localhost website as well
its already sharing
the server
ah nice then
gee thanks for naming your classes rectangle and rectangle1
welcome
bar1
bar2
bar3
l o n g t e x t c o n t a i n e r
thats urs
lol
i just yanked the code off of that
and put it in this
please wait whilst i analyze
have fun
i should make each box have like a entire container or something
that would make it a lot nicer
its
mostly
ok
it could be better
yes
yea ill prob make it better when i move it into the proper thing
mabye ill use css modules
i would make the about me and works
into like
containers
which contain
the bars
and the text
this
that would be a lot cleaner
yes
that makes hover so much easier as well
for le animations
yes
but the left text
is still
yeah
need work
it does
i think you can get it to work though
just
maybe rely less on absolute positioning
it will make things better
*cough
yea
everything is fixed
also make a new class
for bar
and rectangle
and text
for the redundant styling
hmm yea
i sort of did that
but not really
i wanna see first how to move left text over
i gtg tho
its way to far right
yea ill work on it
ok bye
cya
my package has been sterilized
I hav question on frq thing for apcs
why do u need this line in the frq
like what does it do
why is it written like that
that is the key
like
}))_)Ij;
idk
anyway let me see
much thanks
also for context here is the prompt
yea i got htat
im reading it rn
ok so
it is ending like
4 things
it says that the raceLength
has to be at least ten
otherwise it wont race
in that case you have to train
yuh
so it calls the train with the training time
the trainingtime tho
why are they dividing by 60
cuz time
i mean unless training time
but why would you have to call the train method
it like
uses the superclass
i think
so it handles the like train method
also wouldent u put like super.train(trainingtime);
u dont have to
ooooo
u can but u dont have to in this case
since it's the same between the super class and the subclass
so for clarity you can
it's like
this.thing() vs thing()
yeaa
in a case where you override train
i throught you always had to do super
nah
think about it
it's like
in the runner class
either that, or im really stupid
im pretty sure im right
I think you're right
Good
yuh, thank you ramesh
Np
lol I sent a message
and unigram
died
bruhh
its last words
they have this new update
the messages show up fancier
i tried to do my AP Sem assignment earlier today
and i literally collapsed
and fell asleep
on my desk
and woke up an hour later
lol
I have done that once
with debate
it was like 1 in the morning
lol this was 1 in the afternoon
lol
i have a tendency to do this sometimes
the problem was like
i was leaning on my leg
and i cut off its bloodflow
so when i woke up
i could not move it
ha
and it was cold
i like
stumbled to my bed
and shook it around
until the blood flowed
i will not do that again
i will sleep on a bed next time
when that happened for debate I fell off my chair and that is what woke me up
lmao
so at 5 in the morning my mother heard a loud bang
and thought we were getting robbed
lolol
imma do my guided reading
bye
bye
so then
how do you know
someone has not uploaded the no no illegal stuff to it
i dont
Um
can the authorities come after you
the elites
you know
i could create
a google account
and upload illegal stuff to it
yes
and a Mega account
but if they do this
and no one would know
you can comply
yes
also what do you consider "illegal stuff"
child pornography
is illegal
i guess
The printing of da rocket engine commences
welcome to free video compression
featuring ffmpeg
is that like
a fancy resin printer
Yuh
noicety
But Amazon prime day
how much it costt
So 180
But what about
the originell
i spel
Like 250 I think
how big
can in print
resin printers look nice
120 68 170
it is big for resin printer
o
thats
uwu
i shud get one maybe
yuh
if i actually used my regular 3d printer doe
they getting cheeper
do you have to like
level the bed
no it autolevel
and do the prints fail every time
SCHMANCY
yuhhhh
its like super high quality prints
brooooo
i wanttttt
uwuwuuu
its like a china sla printer tho
that fine
acchually
the softwhere is garbo
do you approve of the biden administration's handling of china
cuz it no do cura
i haven't tried octoprint for this yet
idk if it would work
ima see
but for the biden china thing
but politck
yes
yes and no
interseting
yes on how he is taking a multinational approach to this
no to how he is simping the us military
how is he simping the military
i havent
heard about it yet
so edjucate me
he has canceled some traning excersizes and advised the pentagon to like stop sailing in the straight of Taiwan and the scs a bit
Interesting
so kinda letting china have at it with other nations in the scs
but i do like how he has not removed trump tariffs yet
Hmm
Idk how I feel about china tbh
china scary
Because on one hand their government
is garbage
like
the most god-awful garbage ever
yuh
but there are also chinese citizens
and it's not their fault really their government is like that
yuh
they dont really have a choice
so
if we start pressuring china
the citizens suffer
which is pointless
the government needs to suffer
but the thing is that the Chinese citizens are hurt more when china gets monee from trade
cuz china essencally controls all buisnuess
What about
chinese businessowners
since
china isn't a command economy
they suffer more when china hav more money cuz like social credit system ect
and plus we would be weighing us jobs over china jobs
if we let china flourish then perhaps like
the rich people can get enough power to throw out the government
ok who am i fooling
this is not going to happen
lol
imho as much as i really dont like it
the best solution imo
is like
ussr style
the US military gets involved and yeets the ccp to taiwan
and then the taiwanese governent
goes to beijing
i honestly dont know any other soultion that would work
y would ccp go to taiwan
or just outright
delete the ccp
yuh
but that would be like ussr colapse
that aint happening
where us pressure china to hav freedom of press
do you think covid came from the wuhan labs
and then ppl revolt
because if that is true
it was proven by who
no the who said that like
like they had study
it came from animals in south china
but the who head said he was skeptical of the animal theory
wait sry an austrialian ministry of health
also some people in the US said it too
like
biden administration people
also there was like big independent study
and then also if it came from the wuhan labs
then hopefully
the entire world gets triggered at china
i mean
then the ccp is screwed
the entire world simps for china
perhaps
if they want to do something
stop recognizing china
recognize taiwan
and then
watch ur economy collapse
and even though like its p ovious that china no control virus cuz censorship countrys still say that china no at fault
yuh
but the us can like only do that
cuz we hav bigger econ
So we need to reindustrialize or something
or I read that like investing in india is an option
yea i read something on that too
it could work
it would be nice if it worked
india is full of nationalists
that like India is going through its early stages of its industrial rev so us companies invest ther
e
yuh
so it could like
democracy might fail
but I doubt it
nah
it's lasted quite a while there
like 70 years
yuh and with like 1.5 b ppl its hard to change things
also i can do whatever the hell i want in india
like i can just go there and outright buy land without any issues
lol
that is best
i think i can do anything except like vote
that is how it is soposed to be
but
bruhh
thats because i have the oci thing
india
thing
like oci means overseas citizen of india
that magic thingy gives me visa free access to india
wait u were born in india
no
children of parents
can get it
oooooo
so technically i have a dual citizenship
too bad I dont have canadian citizenship
does that mean dual taxes
then i could go to college for free
no
lol
ooooo
not free
but like
dirt cheap
and the education is still good
cuz like i hav a british friend who was born in the uk, but holds dual citizenship in us and is going to go to uk for collage cuz it is cheepo
yuhhhhh
the US is like
the only place where college tuition is ridiculous
the high admission is due to gov loans tho
I mean I could go to india for college
but still
im pretty sure I don't want to do that
if gov stops giving out collage loans then collage price plummitt
yuh idt the schools are as good then as in the us
they told me that
the gov needs fund colleges more
they stopped doing that
so the colleges charge more now
private collages were never funded by gov
yeah
but public colleges
collages hav like unlimited monee
why ramesh
do u have to ask this
I like
at this hour
political talk
It's engaging and fun
cy has awoken
it is
and I get to see multiple viewpoints
i see
so i dont live under a democratic rock
also you talked about octoprint on SLA/DLP
yeah no
they dont use GCODE
as far as i remember
i mean i am not far right, but i offer different viewpoint, im like libratarian
yuh, mine uses like lgs30
witch is like for printer
its a bunch of pictures
cuz lcd
yeah
that are displayed on the LCD
yuh
also isnt the resin a mess
and a bad smell
no
its not bad
like it smells a bit
but it is not messy
but it is not a overwhelming or bad smell
lol you know what maker's muse said about the Elegoo SLA printer
he said it kept getting
ele-goo
all over his hands
lol
Longer Orange
how do ppl get stickey hands with resin
cuz like
u shake bottle
u pour bottle
on hands
and close bottle
pour slow then
idk
i would get an sla
my hands dont get ele-goo
but i dont use my printer much
at least not right now
if i get into fpv
that's a different story
cuz i hardwere person printer like my lifeblood
especially with the micro quads
i am making roket test stand
when u break things
its like
i could print stuff for u
hard to print them on big printer
you could
send files and i will print
wait also how do u cure them
uv
no like
they need post curing
yuh
you have a uv box
i put them in an isopropal alchoal bath, then i hav like a uv germination chamber so i just put the parts in there
germicidal chamber you mean
no germanation
wait
i germanate plants
for plants
not bacteria
whoops
san marazano tomatos
cuz Italian ppl
cyfinfaza: san marazano tomato
you know what would be a fun science project
to attempt to encode VP9 or something similar into an analog signal
or a hybrid signal
both analog and digital
my grandpa act developed modulation techniques for signals transisioning from analog to digital while at bell labs
yeah
for like
1G to 2G
cell phones
or was it from 2G to 3G
no like analog raido waves
yeah
then 1g
cuz it was super early stuff
1g was analog
i would hav to ask him tho
yuh so 1g to 2g, analog to digital
actually
i think
so
1g was analog voice only
2g was analog voice with some digital and later internet options
3g was all digital
yea cuz he did work on digital microwave raido
so def 2g
yeah
2g was like
1991
release
so developed in the late 80s
he worked on it in the early to mid 80s
then moved to fiber
cuz da speeds
my dad is in fiber
not literally
ooooo
but professionally
he knows about the like
XUV
which makes the modern processirz
ooooooo
the Taiwanese
they have it all
they have
the XUV
no one else
has XUV
other than like
maybe samsung
that's why the government is supporting Intel
cuz
they want
yuh cuz after the fall of atnt then lucent all transmission tech reacherch and manufacturing in the us went like poop
XUV in the US
well this is manufacturing
see
XUV
is 13nm
compared to the previous generation
which was 193nm
my dad told me that XUV is the terminus
there is no need for anything else
after that
because
XUV is capable of making transistors
that are
as small as physically possible
i read something on how they are making individual atoms transistors
is that like xuv
they did that a while ago
no
i dont think its xuv
how u get smaller then an atom then
no i think it was impractical
or it just didn't actually work
ok
ima go cuz i hav the tired and i can act get sleep tonight
gn
i have to do homework lol
gn
the ultimate procrastonation
just
most of it
cmon i need to do my chemistry
thats why u dont do insider builds
i suppose
i n t e r m o l e c u l a r   f o r c e s
windows has failed u
well had
oh
wait
lemme check
im 2/4
I got Pres des étoiles and Comme ci comme ca
get urself that tld
^^ instructions
right now im playing with rust
and finding out it has no ternary operator
i made it work kinda
it was so weird
i had to set a left modifier to the left text to go back like 125 px
didn't i tell you to change the line-height property
yea that started to change like its position on the page
or is this not for that
not for that
you should surge
its no where near completion
that doesn't matter
that way ppl can see
ur progress
ugh fine
deployed
im assuming its cloud and not my comp hosting it right?
yeah
its CDN
what a dramatic sponge
ikr
its not as bad as cloudflare
it called my project
broken-boat
tbh its not bad
it isnt but
it could be much better
aka using components for 90% of this
also making it work better on mobile
and actually defining the font
yea mobile ill do later
?
u mean not myFirstFont
idk it does not appear that the font is set
its like
times new roman
and its
ugly
uh it should be set
size is weird
rn
idk its probably just me
although
but it should be using libre baskville
the css grabs it
send css
screenshot
oh its like
a static file
yea
oh its just the AV
that does not have a font
the rest of the text
is the correct font
im stupid
keep working on it
then surge it when you have something more complete
then i will feedback
ugh this is gonna be annoying
ill work on it tmrw
lol ok
hopefully tmrw i can get everything to line up properly and mabye ill animate a soft load in thing
yeah
Poisson d'avril
oh god i just watched the latest linus tech tips video
YES
YES
The thumbnail alone
^^ timestamped
CodeTools™
Coming soon to a browser near you.
comp sci?
im bored
Hola
Nope
why
Im out
oh out
like
out of the house
Yes
where?
im bored
everyone is in the main room
Uh idk
ok
lol ramesh and his attendance system
wait am I smelling dinner or my power supply
cy's memories of kindergarten
Nope
ok
I found 100$ of digital ocean credits
And so im making my vps and email server
thatll last you 20 months
I think the credits end in a year
But yea
Ideally
lol
you should use Vultr
when you have to start paying
cuz its cheaper
Probably
I need speeeeeeeed
it has
3 gbps
And outbound data transfer
how much is digital ocean giving you
1 tb
vultr on the cheapest plan
$3.50
gives you
500 GB
but
its for the largest transfer
so
you could have
500GB out and 499GB in
and they only count the out
Ah
DO has free inbound
And 1 tb outbound
yeah so if you are only doing outbound
then maybe its better
although you are paying $1.50 less on vultr
True
also
i think vultr only charges like
$0.01 per GB overage
Thats not bad
also how on earth are you supposed to use more than 500gb in a month
for personal use
Idk
actually according to windows i used around 550 GB of transfer
not including nextcloud having a spasm
Cy is surprised that people leave their house
Lol
i wanna see if my email server works
I senda eemale
Um
1 unsent
did u send it?
I sent it
It's like
Hold on
cause i sent emails to it to test
and its working
It's like
Cycling between queued and sending
ah fck
the domain is pointed towards a load balancer
and the server is running behind the balancer but it wont get lets encrypt certs
aka a vps
Wanna call
For a moment
I'm on my phone
uh sure
Join voice chat
wait
speak
my audio is broken one sec
try speaking now
there is 4h
in case you wanted to come
I may do an internship at this company
they need a new frontend
for their platform
and they wanna write it in react or angular
Fancy
Do they accept hs internships?
well so my mom's friend/relative came over
and his wife
is the CEO
Ah
so I talked with her
and she said
she would like meet/interview to discuss
so like
Oo
Well if they accept u then that’s good
she wants to show me the platform they have right now
yeah
she said its too
"90's business looking"
so they wanna redo it
cy is sad
he wanted his drone
and its in bedminster
and they closed
18 minutes before
he realized he could go there to pick it up
so he wouldnt have to wait until monday
nice
just wait the extra day
thats why u avoid usps
cause they dont deliever on sundays
well tbf I get what I paid for
3-8 days
Okay cy u know how when we were debugging my certificate issue and u were proposing things that i could do to fix it
Yeah
U said something bout a forward proxy and id like some explanation how that would work
Cause i have them vpnned together
Um
Join vc
But im not home right now and i realize that for it to work i need to add iptables routes
Cant
Wait
what do you want me to answer
This
alright so
its simple
you use privoxy or something
on DO
and then
you set it up system wide on ur home server
and then
when mailthing or whatever its called wants to request a letsencrypt
the request will go through the proxy
and will appear as your DO IP
which is the one that is in the DNS
Ah i see
you understand
what a proxy is
right
in this case
like
theres a proxy
which is for outbound requests
a reverse proxy
Yea
for inbound requests
or a vpn
for both
Reverse is from internet to a web server
Forward is from a server to the internet
yeah but the server is acting as a client
when it does the letsencrypt
so you use a forward proxy
Makes sense
but you just set up a vpn
so idk why u wanna do all that
If it dont work
ok
makes sense
I gotta make haproxy route every connection to the server
thing is
Which i think can be done very easily
With wildcards
maybe try nginx in stream mode
cuz then like
its one server block
I could
and you just list the ports you wanna forward
I have to try
Once anything works
I can just go with that
idk see what works
Yea
Hopefully having haproxy route will make everything work
Cause i do not wanna deal with iptables
lol idk how iptables work
I dont either
And that makes me scared
i think u be fine with either a vpn
or haproxy and privoxy
Yup
but
heres a question
Either one should work
what if
you used a "cloud load balancer"
from digital ocean
I could
Idk how they work
they may solve this kind of issue
like they may be designed for this
you should see if theres some dedicated system for doing this online
like some SaaS
rather than using IaaS
I could
But the vpn method
Seems to be the most popular
yeah
cuz its the most complete
and most logical
Technically speaking
Couldnt this also bypass the school blocked websites?
what?
Wait no it cant
Dont mind it
they block vpns and proxies
ok try those things
ima go
bye
Yea i will
Cya
TF IS THIS TRACKING HISTORY
Wait
It went back?
Kearny to basking ridge to bedminster back to kearny?
Tf is that
ikr
I bet u
Its a missed/wrong scan somewhere
i mean the whole system went offline yesterday
so that might be a part of it
Or that yea
that said
if banggood
had shipped my order
on time
this would not have happened
U would have gotten it today?
i would have gotten it today
Ah figures
Well u gotta wait till monday
yup
and i know
I mean u could see if u can go and pick it up tmrw
its gonna distract me
no u cant
last time to pick it up
was 1:30 PM today
Ah before loaded onto truck
no before theyre closed
they close
at 1:30
on Saturdays
and are completely closed on sundays
Do they?
yeah its weird
also
I swear they open way later
now its at this regional destination facility
Yea kearny
;alksjdf;lakjsdf;lakjsd;fa;sdlfkja;s i w a n t m y d r o n e
*cough
lol wtf is that
Whats happening to u
But way larger scale
lol
It went from texas back to texas supposedly
mine on fedex went fine
Yes this is a good app
i dont like tho how i have to like
interact with the map through the text
Ehh it gets the information through
i suppose
i mean other than that its pretty nice
Ive seen some many stores that use shopify
Its surprising
its a good platform
I never saw like shopify a year or two ago
And now everywhere i go i see it
Yea it’s convenient
God damn
ok go to like every dev tools website
and you see shopify
in their "who uses our service"
section
i got le certs
Cool

Why
I like how this is the fullscreen button
Haha
No its not for fullscreen, thats for nukes
lol
i would indeed like to raise a concern
Oh of course an EMP
heliumheliumheliumheliumhelium
Its not that surprising
If its translating from Chinese
hahahelium
yeah its like if you are "concerned" you care and you wanna see
so i get it
lol Trump's has already unfolded
Oh no
That quickly?
I didnt expect him to unfold
someone help this translator
theres no like written part to submit or anything right
can you turn back on the VaccineStock thing
my mom needs a vaccine
she was gonna use this other one
but i said she should use yours
The only reason mine worked was because I was up at 12AM
Otherwise
It does not work
So I would use the other thing
Like I would've gotten it without the bot
ok
I think we need to submit the scripts we use but that’s it
ok
also do you know how long its supposed to be
No clue a couple of mins at least
I think 3
i would imagine
ok
ill make mine like
4 mins
Have u done anything for it
no
Yeah same
everything is due friday
and thursday
chem
ap sem
french
math
english
cause thats when spring break is
its next week
and when the MP ends
This is gonna be such a crap week ong
lol
my fpv drone comes today
Fpv?
First Person View
Ohhh nice
time to jump rope
last time i tried to jump rope
my jump rope got tangled in the ceiling fan
so maybe not idk
how does my teacher
mess up my name
when its litteraly written down correctly
in every place possible
how do you mess up "akhil"
ahkil
no joke
oh like ah-kosh
ah-keel
OH THE SPELLING
HAHA
yea
smh
idk teachers usually call me that when like speaking
even though its wrong kinda
english teachers especially
well theres also ak-hill
there is also just a-hill
a hill
yes
i am a hill
lol
i got my drone
and i have now learned
if you leave it plugged in
and not flying
the vtx starts to burn up
so dont do that
Did u destroy the drone
i hope not
As soon as u got it?
the vtx still works
but
Okay good
essentially
i left it plugged in for about 2 mins
and
the video started fine
but
it gradually became
corrupted static
so
and it was getting realllly hot
i let it cool and rebooted it
and it appears to be fine
what is this?
Sry it is hard to see, I'm in da bus so am on my fone
imma try flying my drone outside
it now works
gracias
what about the spaces?
oo how is it?
hard
real hard
in my bedroom at least
i would try flying in a simulator
um
fly outside
its so nice outside
ik
i just had it in my room
cuz like
configuration
and stuff
i put an sd card in the goggles
so i will be able to show you things
time to go outside
have fun
i think my dads gonna let me build a drone
or buy a mavic
i gotta present ledgers and spreadsheets to him tho
lol my dad makes me do that too
although i bought this with birthday money
so i didn't have to this time
wanna see some utterly awful footage of me flying for 7 seconds, crashing upside down, not knowing how to use turtle mode, cursing because i have to walk over to pick up the drone for the 57th time then picking it up, flying it for 7 seconds and crashing again?
its so hard to fly
i eventually just took the goggles off
and flew without them
see in Acro mode you have to like
do the PID yourself
HumanPID
but that's the fancy mode
i did do a 360 flip into the ground
which hit so hard the vtx died for a moment
but the drone is not broken
so i think its pretty strong
lemme warn you if you are planning on getting one of these
get a small one
you will crash
continuously
i have crashed
like
109 times already
and i have broken the frame
just slightly
if i had crashed that violently on a 5 inch
it would have been a much uglier scene
also replacement frames are really easy, just $7, 16 screws and ur done
Oh god
akhil is having second thoughts about fpv drones
Idk
Yes and no
Mabye and so
I wanna get a mavic
But i also wanna build one
Idk i gotta decide
ok come to my house at some point
and fly mine
and then decide
excuse me
what
Sf4 cuz s is more polar cuz 6 es vs c 4es
More polar = higher boiling point
Cuz stronger imf
well i think yeah
i figured it out
cuz
the SF4 has lone pairs
which makes it polar
rather than nonpolar
Yuh
so yeah
higher imf
161/2000 words
the first ones are the hardest to write tho

Skool wifi ded
lol i can tell
im the host now

Lol like that is happening for you
is it back up
No
It's out in the whole district
LMAO
Yuh
Heck
Yes
oh i feel so bad for all those elementary parents
Lol fortinet blocked wifi

What have I missed
the whole world changed in this chat
and you missed it.
I literally gavent looked at this chat for a week
And I come back
And I see 3.5k messages
And a picture of me
wait

I am trying to find it
i think i found it
if you look in media and scroll down
Yea
Pretty much
my French teacher has cancelled class
Nice
lol as if she doesn't do that at least once a week anyway
This must be super nice for the kids at home
tbh its not that nice for me cuz like
its amazing
i miss a class which i was gonna miss anyway
or that was not gonna happen
then i miss math questions
Lmao two different responses
so i cant ask mrs baker
Tru
and she hasn't responded
But Akhil is in CP so he has an easy A
lol
very easy A
except i dont pay attention
so its great
Akhil just reminisces and thinks about life
lol like me in Math Cycle in 7th grade
yea ive been doing some of that
u know like just looking at what i did
Lol
to get here
and realize what an idiot i am
Hahaha
and then i just go about my day
depressed
sad
Nobody saw that....
dammit what now
Do u still have that wetipcard
lol letsencrypt dead
of course
i sleep with it
in case i need to call them
Who doesnt
Cy did we ever set up the hackintosh without needing a usb
i just copypasted the EFI to the main USB
and so now i dont need the install usb to boot
Ok cool
no its still dead
hold on
format
cant you like
to and from the server
for 50 minutes
Ive heard about this
so sort of a scope
letsencrypt autorenew was off
nice
English teachers are forcing me outside
This is like unprecedented
Hope u survive
Ik right
Lol
It's p scary out here
Ikr
No wifi + outside. I can't even see my computer screen
Damn. I couldn’t imagine that
This is like bad
This is code red bad
what
what is going on
at school
Michael is going outside
why
wait
akash
ur in school
what about english
whats the deal with english
English ded
Did u survive?
No
I'm ded
Noooooooooo. How r u going to build your rocket
wait akash
What
did we actually do anything
in english
that i missed
No
k thx
What resolution is that?
Looks kinda bad
But yea is that blender?
no its powerpoint lol
Damn
Fancy
bruh
20$
just for a adapter to vesa
not even a stand
no no thats the apple stand
thats a tier of its own
u cant compare that
apple feet
heck yes
look at them feet
no you can't look at them
thatll cost you $299
thats fine
dude vesa stands are so expensivo
um
my dad got one for like
$30
yea thats how much they are
i mean
what
do you want like
your monitor
to fall
and break
or something
i dont feel like spending 12 + 20 + 30 to use my monitor vertically
ok then heres a solution
duct tape
hot glue
zip ties
done.
true
but i dont have any of those
ok but they are cheaper
i mean what do you have
nothing
except duct tape
and zip ties
hear me out
take the back cover off the monitor
tape it down as a hinge at the top
then
make a long piece of tape
to make it be able to extend on the bottom
then
use that as a stand
i see
that could work
problem solved ✔
idk if it would be stable but it would work
lol
now tell me
what does your ideal city look like
um
um
so i can use your ideas for my French homework
ideal city?
lets see
ideally its geometric
it has a set pattern
tf is that 5th point
marganilized communities?
god damn
like which ones will be present and why
yea
like how will you optimize
to not exclude
see but if u think of it when u add a human element its very hard to optimize but anyway
ITSJUSTAFRENCHASSIGNMENTINEEDIDEAS
the city would have to be a break of bulk location
thats for sure
that way it is part of a larger economy
lol ur being about as helpful to me as i was to you with that monitor stand
prob a metropolis
see im in aphug
and we did city and development
lol
owwwww fck
so ur gonna get a lot more than what u want
my tounge
;aslkdjf;alkj
omg what is this
a;lskdjf;aslkdfj;alskdfj;alskdfj;alskdfj

i should enable 2fa ...
lol cy is an advratiser in poland
How much moola did u spen?
no this is not a make thing
this is a charge thing

$20
cy flew his drone outside
lemme tell you
it was much better
also i had it in the right mode this time
Damn is that ur money or other peoples?
however
i completely broke the frame
Nice
Good job
but it was worth it
i think
i can just 3d print a new one if i need to
no one's money
that's why my account is suspended
i think what these ppl were doing
they take ppls accounts
Wait what?
run them until they get suspended
then
leave
tbh
i dont need no ads
so im good
Wth
Is going on here
start here
Hi everyone
apparently school is cancelled
is this the case
i must have confirmation
Yes
ok
They sent out emails and its on the website
where on the website
Like alerts or somewhere
oh on the district website
not ridge
District info
Yea
Cause the district got affected
these IT people are pathetic
Its sad
im not saying i would have rather had school tomorrow
but
i think we can do better, IT wise
NO
Chem got postponed
To april 22/23
RIP
Not the worst
lol akhil go read the conversation in 4h computers
calum thinks that
his district
is worse than ours
is that for a frame?
Why
ah which website
Did u break your drone already
its not did
lol yes
he did
Nice
Shopify
indeed
shopify
shopify is bueno
Porque
because it is
Becuase why
better prices
better ethics
than amazon
K
it supports local shops as well
which is great
cause its usually better presentation and prices than amazon
I will now consider using Shopify
twist ties
btw just to prime everyone here
I made my own hatchbox
I see
but it's not happening yet
you will find it tomorrow
since officer apps are opening
lol i erased the firmware on my drone
and i cant talk to it anymore
time to fix that
Shopfiy is like wordpress I think
it's just the platform that local etailers use
yes, although
they have an api/sdk
for building your own website
with store/payment capabilities
i aint paying 29$ for that
wait akhil
since we have a day off
do you wanna stop by my house
and fly my drone
i cant
i believe i have to be quarantined for a week
cause i dont have a vaccine
wait what are you quarantining for
vacation
during spring break
oh so
you have to quarantine
in order to travel
yea
ok

the other one
and NGINX
and
is that supposed to be a sex sticker
this is, as reddit quotes “For Dads on Airplanes"
if i used the real thing it would work
Yes it drives itself
its good when it works
*Yann
hold on
a function
make them a different color and make a single color background
i wanna learn how like the prossessers work to a level where i would be able to put them on bords

I like republicanism
if they do "rm" it will throw a command not found
had to walk
yup
that http streams audio
bc thats what got me before
is its RAM
and they always call on you
I might try finishing the book today
not wifi
why
so i think im gonna stop it
i will be
yuh, also sorry for the late reply
also I got a high temperature scelent so im filling rocket engine todae and making test stand
cuz like its a rocket engine sandwitch of a resin shell and high temp scelent in the middle cuz otherwise it will melt
Haha
No prob she pushed the essay back to friday
did they actually say this from the school
BTSD:
Never changes passwords
Uses the student ID in the URL bar as the password
Uses the student ID as the password for all applications
Me: 
Changes my genesis password so it's not all applications anymore
Me:
2fa
Me: 2fa as well
Your wel block syntax is wrong
You must do 

Me 
  2fa 

or Me: 2fa
No compromise
But whatever
cy flew his drone more
and crashed it more
but its not any more broken now than it was last time
Huh
Mabye u should do a sim first
To mitigate its damage
i could but
im getting ok
also its mainly my obstacles
now
ok so that works
but now
turn off your internet connection
and see that
it still works
LIGHTBULB
what if
i could use a service worker
to proxy connections
within a webpage
Glad I could help
lol
A New View on Sports with Wearable Sensors
Professional athletes have three common goals: to perform better, to stay healthy, and to stay safe. For centuries, these goals have been achieved solely by the athlete, with little to no outside aid, except after problems arise. But recently, new technologies have arrived which can help athletes achieve these goals, the most modern of which are wearable sensors, which will be the focus of this written analysis. 
Wearables – devices that can be worn for tracking and monitoring applications – have grown to an over thirty-billion-dollar industry, in which some of the biggest tech companies, Apple, Microsoft, and Google, participate (PR Newswire). Wearables come in many forms, from simple and cheap pedometers to complex and advanced multi-sensor systems encompassing GPS/RTLS movement tracking and advanced heart monitoring systems (Li et al.). Some wearable technology has even been embedded into fabrics (Buki et al.). From training and performance analysis to rapid rehabilitation, these wearable sensors are capable of changing the whole field of sports and sports research.
Optimizing athlete performance gets increasingly challenging as an athlete progresses in their training, since clearly visible areas of optimization disappear, and in order further optimize performance, one has to look beyond the surface. Until recently, examining biological characteristics of athletes was an involved, expensive process. For example, in order to measure energy expenditure, a method such as direct calorimetry, where a person is placed in a chamber that measures their heat output, would have to be used (Álvarez-García et al.). Or, in order to measure the mental state of an athlete, a questionnaire would be used, which relied on the athlete’s capability to understand their emotions, and accurately record them (Zheng et al.). However, with modern advancements in biology and electronics, such characteristics can be measured in newer, more practical ways, using wearable sensors. 
Understanding the uses of wearable sensors in sports starts with understanding the different types of sensors, and how they work. These sensors can be mostly split into two categories, movement sensors, and sensors that measure the body. GPS (Global Positioning System) and IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensors are two of the most commonly used sensors for motion tracking, especially in consumer wearables (Aroganam et al.). GPS uses satellites to determine the wearable’s position on the planet. By taking multiple measurements, location can be tracked, and average speed, as well as distance travelled, can be determined. IMU sensors detect motion and momentum, and therefore can be used to track steps and record the force of impacts, among other uses. When it comes to sensors for measuring the body, there is a much more diverse landscape. Optical heart rate monitors, as well as electrocardiogram, electromyogram, and electroencephalogram sensors can be used to measure heart rate and heart irregularities (Seshadri et al. "Wearable sensors for monitoring the physiological and biochemical profile of the athlete."). In addition to heart rate though, there are many sensors available for detecting biomarkers. 
Biomarkers are measurable indicators of the status or condition of the body (Seshadri et al. "Wearable sensors for monitoring the physiological and biochemical profile of the athlete.").  They usually constitute bodily fluids, such as blood, urine, or sweat, but they can also be other measurable conditions, such as the conductivity of the skin. These sensors can be used to measure a myriad of things, such as hydration, intensity, fatigue, and stress (Seshadri et al. "Wearable sensors for monitoring the physiological and biochemical profile of the athlete."). Further data, such as performance and workload can be derived from the original data from these sensors (Seshadri et al. "Wearable sensors for monitoring the internal and external workload of the athlete."). Biomarkers can also be used to track allergens and allergic reactions
(Lee et al.). Sweat is one of the most commonly used biomarkers simply because of how easy it is to access, and how much it can convey (Seshadri et al. "Wearable sensors for monitoring the physiological and biochemical profile of the athlete."). In fact, in a study by Lindsay Baker from PepsiCo R&D Life Sciences, along with other researchers from nearby universities in Illinois, it was found that a non-electronic patch could be attached to the body, and microfluidic systems inside the patch would react with sweat on the body, resulting in a colored indicator representing a bodily condition (Baker et al.).
With all of this capability in wearable sensors, it is now possible to measure all the data that was once very tedious to measure, easily, and continuously, which provides for much better data for trainers and athletes to use when attempting to optimize performance (Seshadri et al. "A review of wearable technology"). The use of this technology has other benefits too. In research, for example, wearable sensing systems can provide much more frequent data than previous measurement methods, and they can be used outside the lab to track subjects in more realistic conditions (Wong et al.). Additionally, these sensors can help integrate disabled persons into athletics, by providing insights for equipment customization, and tracking technique and exercise to prevent injury (Rum et al.). 
To add to the physical benefits to using these sensors in sports applications, there are also mental benefits, which are often overlooked. Anxiety in particular, has a large impact on athlete performance (Zheng et al.). Zheng et al. from the University of Hong Kong, however, found that anxiety can be measured using cutting edge wearable EEG and PPG sensors, by identifying and processing heart regularity and variability, eliminating the need for the tedious and inaccurate questionnaires mentioned above. Confirming the efficacy of wearable sensors in identifying psychological conditions is a study by Bailey et al. from the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, which found a correlation between cognitive conditions and data taken from EEG sensors (Bailey et al.). More broadly, the ability to measure and quantify anxiety means that psychological benefits of sports, such as the ones mentioned in Psychological Benefits of Sports and Physical Activities by Alicia Garcia-Falgueras from the Official College of Psychologist in Spain, can be tracked, and their effects can be proven for each individual. Individuals could identify whether their emotions are actually changing, and where they could improve to optimize the positive effects of sports on their mental health. 
Another large use for wearable sensors in sports, is for medical use, when and after injuries occur. Injuries in sports usually come from collisions between players, or between a player and the ground. GPS and IMU data can be recorded to track the speed and impact force of collisions, and this data can be processed using AI technologies to classify collisions (Kelly et al.), which could be used to provide insights to trainers and medial staff, for faster identification of the aid required, and for avoiding future incidents. 
Wearable sensors however also find themselves playing a great part in rehabilitation and recovery after injuries. For rapid and efficient recovery after an incident, proper planning, timing, and knowledge of the current conditions of the patient are neccesary (Dhillon et al.). Many current methods of planning a rehabilitation focus primarily on the period of time since the incident, rather than on actual data (Johnston et al.). And when these traditional methods do resort to collecting data, they are often collecting it with older systems, that do not provide continuous measurements, but rather only spaced-out, periodic measurements, that result in inaccuracies. It is vital to be able to track a patient even when their symptoms are no longer acute, since restarting activities when the body or the brain still need time to heal could have unseen consequences. Johnston
et al. provides an example in post-concussion monitoring, where wearable sensing devices are used to track cognitive characteristics, such as balance ability, and accompanying software is used to measure cognitive capability through more advanced, personalized questionnaires, long past the acute phase of the concussion. 
Despite all the advantages of using wearable sensing devices, there are still limitations and ethical concerns with the use of these devices. Given how recent and advanced modern wearable sensing systems are, many of the limitations are not completely known, and identifying them can be a complex process. The effectiveness of every sensor in the system must be analyzed individually, and external Cloud processing must be analyzed as well (Düking). Additionally, their effectiveness in the consumer space is questionable. In a study by Bridget F. Melton from Georgia Southern University, the effectiveness of a consumer wearable system was tested to see if it would improve or increase the physical activity and sleep quality of the participants. The study did only focus on one racial, gender, and age demographic, but it found minimal to no improvement in physical activity and sleep quality in participants, as was the goal of the system (Melton et al.). These types of results make wearable sensing in consumer applications seem less desirable, although more research would need to be examined in order to come to a definitive conclusion. 
The main criticism of wearable sensors, however, is in their ethics. Most wearable sensors are part of a larger sensing, tracking, and analysis system. A sensor, being a low power device with minimal onboard processing capabilities, will often connect to a mobile device, such as a smartphone via Bluetooth or BLE (a lower power version of Bluetooth), and transmit data to the device, for it to process (Wang et al.). This data though is usually not stored directly on the device, but with a cloud service, that will often be running machine learning algorithms on the data to provide more relevant results (Wang et al.). This means that data collection and handling is in the hands of a company, and the processing and analysis of the data is usually being done by a computer algorithm. The result of this is that while the validity of data may be fairly high, it is not completely guaranteed that it will be correct, or that the person seeing the results will know how to interpret them. Most professional teams do not have time to do additional research on these systems; they are simply looking for a quick return on investment into the system, and so many of them will simply accept whatever the system returns to them, without question (Arnold and Sade). This can become an ethical challenge, since data like this can have a great effect on a player’s career, and if it is wrong it could end up damaging a player’s career without warrant (Roberts et al.). The other ethical concern, of course, is that of surveillance. If data is being sent to a corporation to be stored and processed, that data could also be shared with advertisers, or other, more malevolent entities. Worse, there are instances of teams introducing such systems without data collection consent from players (Arnold and Sade). Government policies on data sharing, especially medical data sharing, will need to be put in place to avoid incidents with athletes’ personal data.
In conclusion, despite the aforementioned limitations and ethical concerns, wearables and wearable sensing have huge potential to change the way sports work. In a letter to his children written in 1903, Theodore Roosevelt addresses his concerns about the safety and usefulness of sports. Today though, with modern technology like wearable sensors, athletes will be safer than ever, and will have the best opportunity to excel in the sports they wish to pursue. Comments like those made by Roosevelt in 1903 simply no longer hold up today. From optimizing performance to aiding in injury rehabilitation, the possibilities of wearable sensing in sports are endless.
I giv to u
1925 words
thats  alotta words
ikr
I wrote 1756 of them today
lol procrastination is best
lol
I made roket and printed test stand today
cool
Is this for AP seminar
yes
so over spring break ima make boom boom
lol boom boom
Dude I literally procrastinated and filled out an application
How do I guys get so much work done
U guys*
akash do not be jealous of how much work I get done
it may look like a lot
i sat for most of the day watching a printer go burr
but im probably the most inefficient person you know
Cy
lol i think i hold title for second
I still haven’t started the animal 3.0. Project yet
i talked with alankar
I think I tasks that title
lol when was that due
what he say
Eh I will finish it by the e d of the marking period
lol its been extended ur in luck
Thank fully Tan procrastinates more then me
lmao
what alankar say
alankar talk about python
and then
he ask me
cy
why my game slow
Python is fun
and then like
hes running at
It is not like Java
550 fps
and im like
Java is confusing
ok so that's why its lagging
alla time
lol
python just goes
yes
it does
the wheels on the python go round and round
round and round
round and round
the wheels on the python go round and round
cy can u get an esp 32 to do like the aurduino stuff but in pyton
cuz i dont like aurdumo
uPython?
what that
oooooooo
now microcontroller - r pi link ez
wdym
cuz like i was gonna hav an r pi transmit data from aurduino over wifif, but i realized with esp u dont need  pi
but
from what sensor
cuz like
you can just connect a sensor to the pi
no Arduino
no cuz it over i2c
yeah
pi has i2c
it doez
yes
i dont know how to use
ima look it up
its not as easy to use as on arduino
i tried it once
its not that hard
but
sometimes you have to do your own implementation
because there arent a lot of libraries
what sensor are you using
model # please
i send
one sec
cy is anal👁zing
please wait 🔃
this is not exact one
cuz the one i hav is i2c
well i need the exact one
but i could not find it
where did you get it from
wamazon
lol
you should stop using amazon
its xpensive
and slow
but order on moms account cuz she hav da prime
ik but i went to other website
and
i get free fast shipping
send site
and everything is 10-40% cheaper
cuz i need knolage
well i was buying drone stuff
so
it no hav load cell rip
but like
wait
ok so this one doesn't come with an ADC board
but you can just wire it up to the ADC on an Arduino or ESP32
pi no have ADC i dont think 😞
im using a bootleg aurduino nano so idt that hav adc
if its a microcontroller
it has an adc
like
almost 100% chance
what adc
Analog to Digital Converter
ooo then yea
the thing is
the 8 bit arduinos dont have very good adcs
so i would use an esp32
wait
did you know
raspberry pi made a microcontroller
yeaaa i saw that
i think it does uPython
i mean wireless data transmission is not that important to me
and i hav bootleg aruduino
well what are you using this for
but ima look into rpi microcontroler
lab testing?
roket test stand
to test engine thrust
yeah so then you dont need wireless
just plug it in
yuh
also if you have a Nucleo
i think that has a better ADC
i act do
its like 16 bit or something
i thought it 32
i think the Arduino is only 10 bit
cuz arm
no that's the bus
oooooo
the adc is different
i know the main thing with the Arduino is that the timers are only 8 bit
or you can run them in 16 bit mode with a hack but then they run at low freq
but that dosent rly matter for me
see i need high freq
cuz like engine go quik
i mean
also it l8 so ima go bed
you could also
get an oscilloscope
moneee
there was a random one in my amazon cart for cheap
but i think an Arduino is fine
just give it a try
yuh
10-bit is probably good enough
yea cuz it is also a p bad sensor
like +- 1.5 g
i have to create a works cited
ima sleep
bye
gn
proxy is making progress
what is this for?
its a proxy so like
xip
you can access blocked sites
no that's like a dns thing
oh for school
this is a full on proxy
what language
see the user agent
ah
I see
except the way it works is really cool
ha I already have one
but its not rly useful lol
yea i dont see any use for one in school rn
granted im not in school
cuz like the only bocked site i go on is messenger cuz the ppl on deb8 use that
blocked
being virtual is ez
but i hate it
cuz i dont comprehend anything
no u dont
not this type
you have a regular proxy
this is an in-browser proxy
oooo
why dont u use a regular proxy
this is different
I cant talk much now
bye
ok bye
michael's texting style is interestg
yuh, most things i say are like spelled wrong and have no grammer whatsoever, and i do things like cuz and much abbreveation
also i made logo for roket stuff
how it look
oo
it could be a bit simpler
so it looks good as an icon
ok so like just the two arches
and no thing on to
p
no it needs that other thing
but like
make them thick lines
maybe round them
ah ofcourse
good ol greek
u could
i would reccomend just looking at greek fonts and finding one, cause it looks like u used lines and whatnot to make the lambdas
hi
i made my proxy
does someone wanna try my proxy
cool
and find the isp
which room
can you come to 3
why?
lol i found some "file" with "SSSS Access Token"
but i have otherwise not gotten anywhere
its been almost 3 hours
how has it been?
i need a hint
that would require ramesh
not me
but u know how to do it
so
i do
but its not my challenge
so
i guess
*sigh i made a little progress
now ramesh can track me
what did u do?
this may be better
things
like what?
idk lemme keep trying more things
okay
well imma just say rn its been officially 3 hours at this point i believe
ah i sent the wrong card
that should be updated
did you get there
i got to the url thing
with the header
but i put a header
and it doesn't work
ok wtf are you doing
I mean this in the kindest way
lol you can look at your logs
but you are still
hmm
my gitlab pages logs?
no your Caddy logs
ah
he got soemwhere
what header did he put
SSSS-Access-Token
what access token did you put
bramc135o85jofaae7sv7ffgjqokxvbmlixsewbb02vhrwwxzv
show
the entire request
Hmm
ok so
you are a bad
and you did not follow the hint.
which hint
what you put in there is not the hint
bye
if i supply an access token though
it should tell me
that its wrong
not that it can't find it
Noted
im going to figure out IndexedDB
bye
so cy gave up
ok
this time im even more surprised
lol i sorta gave up
but not really
but kinda
can i just tell you
this is the dumbest mistake ever
look at your token
and look at what is in discord
lmao
its lowecase
Nice job cy
cy is listening to Ridge Choir Decades Show 2021
Live right now
Lol Cy got stuck again
wdym
he didnt get far yet
but this part
is comparatively easy
so ill leave you
whats unclear is how the key will need to be posted
i dont have it yet
but
you will get it
100%
if i make a post request
just read the instructions carefully
well no cuz like
i make a post request
with some key
in the data
and it tells me "Not Found"
it is very easy
one could say its
intuitive?
no that's not my issue
i dont think
what i do not get is like
how to form my post request
after i get my key
first get a key
well also what i dont get is how to make the final key
then u can worry about a post request using said key
but i can probably figure that out
hold on
yea
it is very easy
one could say its
intuitive?
which part of it tho
cuz like
so what is?
idk
i keep getting 404 not found
um
I still don't get how the submission works
The original thing
was easier
I removed a character
Maybe I'll add it back
?
a character
Yes
one character was removed
plus a bunch more was added but whatever
what character was removed
/
from where
Oh? /
cy hasn't even solved this game yet
but he already has an idea for one
also you get extra points for guessing [idk how] (1 try) the language/framework I used to make it
ruby
lol
framework
is required in your guess.
on rails
Wrong.
lol
what did you use
You lose.
Game over.
Sinatra/Ruby
k
The Don Salvara Game
You get more points if you can guess what OS/server/etc this uses
How it is being hosted
NixOS/Caddy/Linode
Wrong
That also doesn't have the unicorn/puma (like uwsgi/gunicorn) stuff
lol idk
Alpine Linux to Caddy to alpine docker to puma to kode
Not right now
Um
lol guess
idk it takes the subdomain
and
finds out it corresponds to something
sends a request
and returns the response
how does it proxy all the resources on the page
they can link all over the place
proxies those too
how tho
im seeing
see this is actually a somewhat nontrivial problem
rewrite the html
no
this is my 3rd attempt i think
and it has finally worked.
Excellent
its about 20 lines of server side code
but there is client-side code
hmm
it just proxies the data
if it uses relative paths
wait ramesh
what
hold on
and open the console
and type
now
go to
and do the same thing
ok try in chrome
where it actually works
not now
I have to eat
you will see
how
even that fetch request
is proxied
Hmm
Service workers
yes
HAH
thats quite interesting
but I have to eat
k
idk what ur doing eating at this hour
but i wont judge
I legitimately have not eaten
lol im doing this in algebra rn
lol
i literally completed all the codingbats in 10 minutes last night at 23:49
hahahahah
I did the first 2 but then was like I dont wanna do it anymore
they are all so easy
like 2-3 lines of code
rly
wait no actually the count8 was 4 i think
the last ones look kinda hard
well for me at least
i dident do them yet tho
so idk
lol 2 lines
i do the indents so was like bruhh how 2 lines
lol
im at my dads hous so i dont hav another computer to do zoom
my waptop is munching battery
is dat prozy
proxy
yes
how u make in browser
well act let me think
is it like u make website search stuff, but then u return stuff through website and not browser
service workers
what is that
everyone else: lazy
programmers: efficient
My drone is now stuck in the highest tree
Yipee
Nice
Goddamit that took hours
I think ups delivered my package to the wrong house
And now I don't know what to do
find the house
knock on their door
and kindly notify them
*yawn
Ok I guess I'll do that
Nobody was home
What is it with me and luck these past days
Um
Then just leave it
And they will return it to you
ok i got my package
my mom just texted the neighbors
their doorbell wasnt working
cy is figuring out how to manually implement TOTP
for reasons
I got the fancy google app update
With the fancy animation
That’s some fancy animation
Mine has animation
Not as fancy tho
and its especially fancy
because
when you type a domain
it automatically fetches the favicon
Why
thats paranoid level
Startpage in an anonymous proxy running pages in anonymous mode
lol cy is ultra paranoied
u should then search startpage in startpage
Whats he doing to be so paranoid
Yes
And then view cys thing
nah, he is just making an in browser proxy
I made one with my pi
it is good enough
and is prob better then his
cuz like I can route applacations through it
like the discord updater
that is blocked with skool wifif
i have one of those too
privoxy
and a vpn
but
in browser is the best cuz you can instantly use it anywhere
no need to configure anything
Yuh but like why would you need to use a proxy on a device other then yours. That is not likely this year in school or anytime soon cuz pandemic
This thing I've been using is amazing
NVIDIA vGPU support on consumer GPUs
"Update Windows"
^^ timestamped
lol I saw that
How
Just how
net above da pool
codetools is making me sick
"maintainability"
is
lacking
I may take the liberty this spring break
to attempt a full jamstack approach
im 80% of the way to that decision
contemplating how much code would have to be rewritten
its between next.js and gatsby
im leaning towards gatsby
Nice one chief
I sadly cant really work on anything
are you like
not home
Yes
ah nice
im home
rewriting code
for the
Must be nice
*cough
third time
Haha
but this time
its gonna work.
Dont worry about it
Im just documenting
lol
i estimate
about
40%
code rewritten
mainly because i have to move a bunch of server-side logic client-side
but i think it will work
and besides
its more interesting than actually adding functionality
step 1: make an api
J-avascript A-pi M-arkup
wait akhil
are you in a different time zone
where are you?
Yes
Im an hour behind i believe
So ur florida, texas time
Cancun
Mehico
ah
wait so
yeah
central time
one hour
so its 7:48 where you are
Yea
on Wednesday
an electrician will come
to my house
and find a GFCI
its so pathetic
its not that hard to build a house where all the GFCIs are visible
then after they do that like 8 outlets will start working
tbh ill be pretty amazed if they can find it
i have spent hours
looking
everywhere
in the meantime, i have to write an API
so what am i waiting for
imma get started
someone tell me why this works in chrome and not firefox
lol wtf is this
get Unregistered
wait
chrome also had a service worker registered
wait
now theyre both gone
and
it still works in chrome
and doesn't work in firefox
cy: i should use graphql
cy2: gtfo im not making a graphql api
*yawn
ha I only have to deal with vilotile reactions
3C21H25ClO5 + 7KNO3 = boom
words
lol
im rewriting code
which is kinda like doing math homework
it takes time
its very tedius
but
i act might file a paton
lol
my mom and dad have some of those
cuz like i think i found a way to do like high temp rocket stuff with 3d print
wordswordswordswordswordswordswords
oooooooo
i need to keep rewriting code
bye
ima sleep
bye
bye
How many problems?
Huh
no its working
those are yellow problems
problems as important as
of course now
and those are red
but
Um
*cough
i just have to copy and paste 300 lines of code
and then it will work
*hopefully
time to take a break
my load cell has arrived
it is time to assemble the test stand
and add insulator to my roket
take a video
i wanna see roket
when JavaScript enters your tab titles
prinner go brrr
software be bork
Yuh
Load cell go ehhh
cy is debugging why his cookies wont set
Someone should make like one of those animal sound spinny things but with like instead of cow go moo u have printer go birr
I hate code
lol
I had to make my own library for load cell
Cuz I could no fins
its just ADC
Find
Ik but like Miko no like
lol
i need to make my cookies go set
you make ur printer go brrr
I'm working on code so it no b bork
ok
i think this has something to do with cloudflare
imma go tell cloudflare to stop breaking my code
the migration is mostly complete
galaxy buds are so weird
the later in the day the better they sound
I think thats for anything
My earbuds sound so nice after dinner and stuff
nah my regular samsung AKG earbuds sound good anytime
yeah exactly
with the galaxy buds
i like jamstack
i will be using jamstack from now on
Have fun
jamstack provides rapid development and deployment, and it provides greater scalability
now i have to make a good ui
im not sure how i wanna make it
it doesn't have to do too much
it has to "file manage" 3 types of content
and allow for the creation of new content
i get a vaccine tomorrow
I get a vaccine right now
Nice
I had a stick
Stuck up my nose
To my throat
Why
Covid testing
Oh
I have never gotten tested
They stick this small thing up ur nose
All the way down
That must feel interesting
It tickled and hurt at the same time
It was very weird
Lol
U got ur second dose?
No first
Ah nice
Second is may 6th
But apparently the first dose alone of pfizer is like 70% effective
Yea so u should be good
I need to get stupid covid testing
Its so cancer
Why can u leave the US
without one
But need one on the way back
Lol
I'm in the observation area
Just sitting
Until 2:03
Um
They have to make sure I don't have any reactions
Isnt it 2 already?
Lol 3:02
Okay that makes more sense
U have to stay for an hour?
Damn
Akhil
Time zones
I have 6 more minutes
Wait yea
Okay thats not that long
15 mins you have to be observed
Stupid zones
It's weird they have the national guard here
?
Like the personnel at this facility
At the hospital?
Huh
It's like half national guard members
And half other ppl
Huh
It might be military personnel
To ya know
Stop people
Also i realized i broke face id
I can face id
With a mask now
Thats not a feature
I need to redo my face id
Which is sad cause its been learning and stuff for 2+ years
I mean
You should redo it somewhat often
For better speed
True
Although that's more relevant to fingerprint
Yea face id is pretty fast
New apple event on the 20th btw
My facial recognition is still going strong since idk when
Time to see what apple concocted this time
I see
Yea
I don't wanna talk more since I'm on my phone
And it gives me a headache
New ipad and ios 14.5 hopefully
Ah yea its annoying
Bye
Cya
*does not work on mobile yet
Okay nice disclaimer
This isn’t grammatically correct is it?
Easy doesnt fit
lol i think that's what ramesh said
Yea u dont need the easy
Get rid of it
lol ur like Mr Y
hes like
i hate that title
get rid of it
Write, Practice, Test
Yes
no on my essay
it had a title
and he said
like
no
that's a bad
title
remove it
i dont like it
imma eat dinner bye
Coffee
so apparently if my drone gets wet enough outside the rx shorts out and it can't listen to the transmitter anymore
it was a good test of the failsafe settings, i guess
now i have to wait for it to dry
i think Vercel is stuck in a loop
trying to build my application
it seems to be messing with my submodule inside a submodule
imma take my old api code
and like
strip away all the non-api parts
that were used for the non-jamstack version of CodeTools
cy know how to use git
Git control is nice
No yeah i do the same
you see cy reads some thing saying how to use submodules
so he adds a submodule
then
he wants to remove it
and he cant figure it out
'xcuse me
what
i did that
is it gone
did replit delete it
hi ramesh
i have not talked with ramesh in a while
ramesh i worked on codetools
you should see the progress
it is now fully jamstack
obviously the websockets stuff and jrunner cannot really be serverless
but the frontend and main api are
cy how u get vaccine, my mom was still not able to get hers
my dad signed me up at like 7 different sites
and one of them said we have excess
come get it
lol
yea that's how everyone I know got theirs
you go at the end of the dya
or yu qualify
or yu use bot
yu
honestly it is not worth it cuz like my mom healthy and I  healthy and im still kinda skeptical of it cuz it under emergency use authorisation
eh
it works
so im in no rush
yuh
according
it works
to israel
my mom was like
i might as well get it right
ur going back to school
so
u need a vaccine
lol
ramesh
i already have one
i need comments on
ill be getting two
later
i finally did kode for test stand
it work now
cool
I j filled my motor with the fuel and insulator
tommorw ima do the test fire
remember to video
and send
Ooo
yuh
there is 4h
4h is now
now is 4h
Cool
I cannot attend
Due to circumstances
i mean
its all virtual anyway
although
actually
the time zones
are like
No its not even time zones
Yea
oh wait
ur home now
Si
Welcome to New Jersey
Its good to be back
We hope you enjoy your stay
Watch
The immigration officer will say the same thing
Im assuming i gotta go through sekurity twice but yea
ok
Rip my rocket has not fully cured ima hav to postpone test to tommrow
sad
but u dont wanna launch it while its weak
so
see I have a dilemma
i wanna switch databases
for codetools
i dont wanna use mongodb
there are better options
Then switch
i would have to rewrite the code
again
Then rewrite it
also i would have to learn
how to use this database
Then learn
and host it
cuz like
Then host it
mongodb gives me free reliable hosting
Use a vps and host
$
dgraph also has free hosting
but
its 1MB of transfer per day
which is
*cough
not enough
Idk i would say switch dbs
Do it now rather than later
i mean it would be really useful to have dgraph
especially right now
cuz i can be like
get me all the names of all the owners of all the challenge_editors who's parents have this ID
all in one query
but they dont have free hosting
and i want my free hosting
trying to keep costs down
right now codetools is going to be hosted on Vercel and Vultr
since i offload the main UI and API to Vercel i dont have to put much on vultr
so i can use my existing one
and Vercel is free
i wanna try vercel
ive seen it a bunch
its so nice
^^ vercel
it is nice in particular because it has python api support
also do u have mongodb set up with a hot standby?
and my api is python
?
since one mongo thing is 500mb
u can have it switch to another one once its full
i dont need more than 500mb
so im not going to bother with trying to configure that
on Atlas
they probably prevent you from configuring that on atlas
because like
they dont want you having more than 500MB
i mean
u could prob make a script to do that
as long as they have some sort of api for creating and destroying instances
Tbh idrc
I'll just get some funding if I actually need it
But 500mb is a lot
yea
They also give you faster network if you pay I think
i mean
u have mongodb credits
for free
like 100$
so u could use that
Do I?
With github?
github student dev thing
yea
Hmm
i think its 100$
I wonder if they have some for dgraph
u can check
i dont think so
Imma check that later
I gtg rn
Bye
adios
im switching my lights to tasmota
I got my second shot
Yet
Yet
Key word
Tell me
Tomorrow might be my last day
What search engine did u use after getting the shot
It was bing right?
of course
it was really weird
i just felt this urge
to start using bing
Interesting
And I felt really warm cuddly feelings when I heard the word "bill gates"
yeah
Ur also installing windows now rnt u
see my windows usb
died
i have to use an actual windows vm
Very interesting
but
yeah
i really want to install windows for no reason
Its begun
i mean
The Microchipping
bill gates is helping us
it's our only shot to get out the pandemic
but im really thankful for bill gates
?
what do you mean
Oh nothing
bill gates really helped
Man u certainly love bill gates huh
yeah idk why
but yeah
ur right
ive
always loved bill gates tho
What about windows
Ik u disliked it at a point
no?
im installing it rn idk
this is windows tho
*in the corner of his vision, there it stood. “Hi”, “Were getting things ready for you”*
man akihl i wish windows phones were still a thing
Haha
u know ive wanted a surface duo for a while
sucks that it ain't windows
but whatever
They are
Nokia phones exist
i want a nokia phone
with
a bill gates signature
Um
i love bill gates
i changed my pfp
Haha
wdym
im really
thankful for bill gates
hi ramesh
hi
i love bill gates
love love?
love bill gates
not love love
bill gates
that would be weird
but I love bill gates
lol
Nope
"Later"
lol
I am actually trying to install windows right now
and I need to make it install windows
i should do homework
the johnson and johnson vaccine was cancelled
what do you think cy
i mean
idk
if its bad

hi my name is mr y
today we will be discussing the second component of PT2, the IMP
the IMP is a 6-8 minute presentation
that must incorporate all your research
it is 15% of your AP score
I want your slides in by this wednesday
nice
Why did you get something
no im just wondering
since you emailed him
recently
Idk you could email him and say we're vaccinated or something
Well me
More than you
lol
i mean
my mom said the first one is like
80% effective
Yes
but u need the second one
U don
Do
Idk why don
idk either
Akhils right
phone keyboard
no im just saying like its better than no vaccine
yeah
also a side effect might be that u start to love bill gates and microsoft so
but like can we do ipad club if we hab vaccine
i already have that side effect
haha
pre existing conditions
what is ipad club?
tbh the answer is probably no
for a while
cuz theyre old ppl
and like
we need to wait
also idk if fv would even let us in
outdoor
lol true
idk i just want life to be 2019 again
and i am
getting closer
to this
*sigh
pandemic
did anyone else get vaccine
c'est la pandemie
so far 3 friends have it
oui c'est mais je deteste
um
no
its
grammatically incorrect
and
it doesn't rhyme
Lol
ramesh clearly no know french
évidement je ne sais pas le français
lol
cdknight: lol
lol
cdknight: lol
i love bill gates
the JS compiler wants me to use ===
hai
do you know anyone else who has gotten the vaccine
I know one who has both shots
thats alot of equal signs
and two who have one
ik someone who is getting it
idk anyone
in the next few days
im just trying to plan my post pandemic party
nice
oh god
lol

I want more people with vaccines
gl replacing all those equal signgs
but actually for young people i can get the hesitency
since no ones gotten it yet
like the first vaccine i thought id die
not even kidding
i just had the idea
and its already amazing
oh god
tf is that
a user-friendly UI
just like the school's website
see the hidden links
yes
its amazing
kwality
­WAIT I HAVE A SURFACE PEN
AND ITS BATTERY IS PROBABLY NOT DEAD
WAIT
i was like
oh no
how am i gonna do my chem and math and French without my bamboo ink
the battery is dead
i think i can just pull the battery from my surface pen
dammit that battery is dead too
;alksdjf;alskdfj
i am going to charge my alkaline battery
i have no idea how to do this
tf
why?
just get a new one
i need my pen
now.
yea just get a battery
i asked my dad to get one
but theyre really hard to find
you have to get them online
i just need the slightest bit of charge
it just died today during chem
and i only need it to work until a new battery comes
so imma put my variable psu at 3v 20ma
and see if it charges
dont blow up
problem is its not making good contact
hold on
thing is like
the battery isnt getting warm
so where is the energy going
it must be going into the battery
ok the battery is charging
it went up to 1.05 volts
nice
i cant charge it for too long tho
cuz it might leak
and then that would be bad
reliable, dependable quality
Kwality
the problem is the voltage drops rapidly after it is disconnected
meh
i mean
one of these batteries at full capacity lasts 1-2 years of regular use
so 1-2 days is 365 times less charge than that
that i need
ok im trying it now
the pen works
sorta
no the pen isnt working anymore
its making a high pitched buzzing sound
thats not good
im charging the battery more
Did it work
it did
remarkably
enough for me to draw my French visual component
hi matt i stole your idea of putting the city on a mountain
Dang I can’t compete with those skills
Also new hackintosh
cool
i need to choose slide transitions
i have it set to page curl
like a book
cuz like
im telling a story
but there are some really fancy ones
hold on
too many options
ice fishing
…
this is a wonderful city
combating the issues of racism
solving climate change
*claps
fast internet at low costs
(not at all filled in with a blue highlighter)
tourism
transparent plane engines
you name it
we have it
wow
check that off
my entire essay is now a works cited
Finally
i see
in case you wanted to stay
Nah
k
I am doing other things
I mean I might just stay here and watch
i like
reverted the repo it was a submodule in
and then it was gone
and now it throws websockets errors
Don't use submodules
Pull the downstream JRunner5 and run it separately
isnt it upstream?
idk i think i got it to work
but that was not the main issue
the main issue was that i have this whole network of remote origin nonsense
upstream remote
and whatnot
so like
git pull erases half my files
and i git pulled
why is windows being annoying
its stuck at 10%
um
thats not good
how about
do not use submodules
its not submodules
its like
i have a repository
try hg
this is what I do
I don't try fixing it
I use something else lol
set as an upstream remote for another repository
which is a submodule for another repository
i dont like git
its too complicated
i swear shopify and mailchimp
are on like
every other dev tool website
ooo aaugustin replied to my GitHub issue
he has posted an entire guide on serverless hosting his websockets library on Heroku
cy likes github
its full of ppl who actually care
ramesh
remove the protobuf please
it is driving me insane
i have to deal with git submodules
in order to use it
I have the confusion
I do not have an answer, but why are you using internet explorer, or does WebAssign really look that bad
webassign is horrable
it is ugly af
oh btw ramesh
like straight out of the 90s
a. i made it work
Its 12.1
How did i get there
I have no clue
thank u akhil
I will try and figure out
Yes lemme know when u do
In some time, maybe
ok
oh also akhil
Hola
did you wanna host a jrunner instance on ur server
no port forwarding needed
Uh sure
Im rn doing a rework of my lab enviroment
But once its up and everythings configured ill host it
ok
its pretty easy to host it
just like
git clone rameshs repo
then set 3 environment variables
Okay ill do it later
yeah
Try making it a docker container
That would be cool
there is one issue though
which is that if the websocket connection breaks
it wont restart
wait
can you configure that in docker
like
if the process dies
Yea
how do u do that
Im not entirely sure
imma see
ill make
it
I have some experience with dockerfiles
this is actually very neccesary if im hosting on heroku
I
will make this Jrunner5 dockerfile
don't worry
yes
because you see
heroku
kills
your server
every 30 mins
if there are no new requests
just wait
give me 5 minutes
im waiting
ill have a docker file
docker is really easy
its like
GET this
SET that
DIRECTORY there
RUN the thing
i
am making a docker image now
are you gonna add it to the repo
how does docker work again
.dockerfile
?
I will tell you when I am done
ok
i have a dockerfile
but it may not be the nicest thing in the world
tbh idrc as long as it works
is it on github
in a second
i want to test that it runs
what's the url
ok
give me a second
wait
stop
dont
stop
stop
why
*sigh
then I have to change the source code
right
um
as far as i remember
jrunner5 already has the path
yes
the right path
codetool
lol
lol
codetolol
ok
does it connect
yes
ok
1 sec
pushed
not now
i have to read something for english
what if you click on it
and then like
i did
unclick on it
ok you clicked on it
thx
lol
should I write my own codetools
like unpolished bad-looking codetools
to see if I can write it in as few lines of code or less
not to compete with yours
no seriously
I just want to see how good I can make web dev
i mean sure
but
it takes a
while
and
the api docs
the point is to write it in as few lines of code as possible
like
as fast as I can
i mean that's what i did
it only took this long cuz i switched frameworks twice
yeah im not gonna use react or any frontend stuff
maybe two api endpoints total
wdym make your own codetools
without a frontend
yes
what does that mean
no wait
1. im gonna write it in bash
2. the entire HTML will be echo calls
3. there will be a textbox for the code
4. the database is a text file
5. I will probably cry at the end
um
uh
you do you
yes
i will do me and do my homework
i can be your api docs
if you need them
lol ok
i mean i wrote jrunner5
which you need
no like
i want to make something that only uses jrunner5
that's not codetools then
thats like
clonecodetools
a jrunner5 frontend written in bash
yes
and i have work to do
so this wont happen until like
june
since i have ap tests
imma figure out that docker container
for a limited period of time
then go do my homework
bye
bye
how to i install docker on linux
this works
I can kill the dyno
and it will auto reconnect
however
it only works on linux x86_64
wont work on windows
wont work on raspberrypi
how long is yours
I haven’t started
what
how
*gulps sensibly*
its due like
by tomorrow
we are doing a reflection thing tmrw
lol ok
This is what she said to me
then that's what it is
do you have a script?
No
I have all night tho
lol
What did u use
If u used slides can u show me
She never gave us any examples
I did use slides
but
really fancy slides
not really slides
Can I see them
im exporting the video
hold on
Kk
the audio is really quiet
Uh where’s your map
on the first slide
any other concerns
i need feedback
you speako frencho
i speako frencho
watcho video and give meo feedbacko
No you need an actual map of the city
I thought
um
I asked her after class
bro she never clarifies anything
my dad told me if the teacher tells you you can do whatever you want, do whatever you want
they cant take points off then
Tour of ideal city
I asked her after class
She was going on about monuments, shops, location of city center
Email her
*yawn
Bruj
i might email her
i dont have an awful lot of time left to work on this
generally
i have math and chem and AP sem
oo it rhymes
I spent the whole day doing apush
Now I’m rushing to finish French
idk i think ill be fine
but maybe ill add an extra slide in there
i did it in powerpoint so adding another slide with audio is very quick
i dont have to re-record the whole audio
i have to eat dinner bye
Bud
Bye*
When is the professionalism due
what is this
why
is it so damn colorful
WHERE IS THE SILVER AND BLACK
idk why u would get this either
the new ipads are alright
i didnt expect much from those
so its good
still pretty expensive
I think they tryna turn into 🏳️‍🌈
Honestly yea
The macs look disgusting
The beginning of the ms paint map
WHAT
FIRE THEM
FIRE THEM
WHO MADE THE BATTERY USER REPLACEABLE
I WANT THEM OUT
NOW
Yes
THIS WILL DESTROY OUR BRAND
IT WILL DESTROY OUR COMPANY
Not even that
They made it replaceable for the wrong thing
If someone gets that tag they can remove the battery
Bam no tracking
lol just like
smash it
no more tracking
Or that
Fair
But user replaceable?
Damn
the new imacs look pretty nice from the back
idk from the front
I dislike the front
they look a bit dated
That bottom bar thing
Is ugly
yeah...
i like the idea tho
of the thinness
but it seems like its just meant to look bad next to the upcoming imac pro
that way you buy the pro
the ipad with M1
is
good
very good
Thats ehh
further rubbing their thumb in the industry
It looks like an xdr display
about how good their chip is
Yea
Ipad is fine
That i can live with
purple iphone
yipee
tech
wow
high tech purple
Purpl
Very purpl
AirTag
um
good
cy like
Really?
yes
Its expensive tho
not really
30$ for one tracker
that's not much
Tiles r like 30$ for a couple
Huh
Then ig its fine
tiles are not as feature
the thing is their implementation will probably be very good
Yea
once again their marketing proves very strategic
With find my
i really like their marketing
I like the app
its fun to watch
Its not bad
I dislike
That there is no black
Or space grey
idk
On the imacs
you see tho how like
with that air tag
Silver and space grey are what they r known for
locks you into the ecosystem
Yea
Once u have that
U need an iphone to use it
the ipad and the mac will soon merge
maybe not soon
but
They look kinda the same ngl
give it a few years
Yea
now
im still waiting
in pc land
for a response
to M1
Well we shall see
maybe itll be NVIDIA
with their fancy stuff
and ARM
maybe itll be Pat Gelsinger
and his new plans
Maybe Lisa Su has something up her sleeve
i heard she wants to go into arm
maybe itll be google
but i dont think so
maybe microsoft
or maybe RISC-V will destroy ARM
then apple will be in trouble
because they have been ARM people
for a while
and if RISC-V beats arm
it will be very hard for them to migrate
honestly go risc-v
open source ftw
Update on the ms paint map
cool
Thank you Cy 😊
You Are Welcome
a p u s h looms in the background
Mm yes
time to study more
with my fresh AAAA batteries
io parlo italiano, non capisco tutto Il video
😞
it dont work
bot bork
cyfinfaza: bone bork
l8r
do you think it would look good on you
lol
bork
i left
on the speaking
hahah
that is like something I would say
io parlo italiano, non capisco tutto Il video
cyfinfaza: I speak Italian, I don't understand all the video
yuh, but it no work on embided messages
I mean that is hard to do
Michael has to study for algebra
idk
bye
lol me too
i kinda know how to do everything
matrix multiplication
rref
vector dot product
cross product
Final copy of map
cool
remember not to resize the canvas
I didn’t
This is how it looks like in slides too
ok
cramers rule
is
x y z
then
like
Funky
you put them in the place
of x
then y
then z
and u get answers
no that's rref
Kramer’s rule is funky too tho
i guess
what else do we need to know
in matrices
"Would you like the close button to minimize the application?"
"No, I would like the minimize button to minimize the application"
"Thank you very much"
well no its not like close minimizes stuff
it closes the app, but the app still stays in memory kinda
so u can quickly launch it again
we will communally stop communism
yes
g a t s b y  d e v e l o p

Gatsby just works
i added this little thing in the corner
Ramesh you are being very sus rn.
He is a confirmed hacker
?
I might add something to CodeTools
what
vim/emacs keybindings in monaco
um
sure
not anytime soon tho
as long as you make them opt-in
i have
yes
and make them easy to switch
AP teststm
oh also ramesh
on the docker
no
do that
so it auto restarts
i will when i deploy it on my server
cuz like
heroku
dies
no
i will do it when I run it on my server
kills
I know
ramesh is offline
I stopped it
im running one on the 4h server
Like I said
its the only place it would run
I will put it on the docker registry
and I will add it to stuff
add compatibility before you do that
cuz it doesn't work on windows
or arm
er
why
idk windows threw like 5 different errors each time
different each time
send me the pi ones
lemme see
ah
that isn't a me problem
that
is an openjdk problem
OpenJDK does not run on arm?
i will see
try changing the docker file
so the first line says
lemme try hold on
oh nvm
remove that
ur docker is broken
try
docker run hello-world
wait
arm32
wait
what
oh its cuz like
yes
Raspbian is arm32
you should run aarch64 linux
how do i check what aarch
i am running
the hell
armv7?
32-bit?
what is this installation
raspberry pi is 64-bit armv8
arm
aarch64
wait
raspbian is not aarch64
try that, perhaps
its running
but without the :15
so idk
i would test, but my pi runs freebsd
lol
so I  have to use jails
omg this is so slow
to extract
use aarch64 linux
it will be faster
lol that 4h server did it in like 2 seconds
first the install
then another 2 seconds for the build
it was like
fassssst
lol i think the pi's internet speed is faster than its disk speed
lllllllllllllllllllllllooooooooooooooooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaadddddddddddddddddddddiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnngggggggggggggggggggggggg gggggggggggggggggggggggrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaddddddddddddddddddddddddlllllllllllllllllllllllllllleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
gggggggggggggrrrrrrrrrraaaaaaaaaaaaddddddddddddddlllllllllllllleeeeeeeeee
dddddddddddddddddddaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaeeeeeeeeeeeeeeemmmmmmmmmmmmooooooooonnnnnnnnnn
raspberry pi slow
the final icing for an app like codetools would be a service worker
that could cache all the pages
so they load in a snap
the problem is
what if i push an update
and the really fancy solution
is webpush
i tell vercel to webpush when there is an update
and then the service workers listen
and when they recieve the webpush
they all delete their cache
mind trying to explain this error
when i run on windows
your docker container
lol ok so it has to do with LF being converted to CRLF on windows
i believe there is a way to tell git specifically not to do this in a .gitattributes file
please do that ramesh
what
YES
Right
That is a valid thing with CRLF
I will do it in some time
ok
i mean you can get it to work if you specifically tell git to not do conversions
in git config
but
that's not nice
I will fix it in some time
I too have homework
ok
load "balancing"
much better
confuse
how cpu munh 334%
look at the CPU %
*337
no you take that and divide it by 12
ooooooooooooo
cuz i have 12 cores
its weird
that is
i mean does it dist the load across the cores to begin with
no its not that
so
each of the containers
is connected to managementWS
which doles out jobs
to the containers
i must do chem test
oh bye
bye
gl
I bacc from chem test
it not bad
omg its so funny to watch my PE teachers try to do a kahoot
first they couldnt share a zoom link to the other meeting
then they couldnt focus the projector for the ppl in class
and they switched the input
and then they didn't share their screen
so the 60 ppl on zoom did not see the questions
not bad
which bill wursts song should i use
cy was taking kemistry kwiz
ah how was it?
not bad
yea
edulastic was being slow
and not responding
but
other than that
it was fine
long long long journey

um
Lol u should have seen his face
idk that's due the 26th so im studying for precalc
Ok
Ill probably do it after school
so i can try and answer then
omg alankar is so screwed on the precalc test
he didn't see the last problem
and didn't do it
otherwise i thought it was fine
oooofffffff
rip alankar
was it like a big question
with many points
4 pts
eeeee
42 pts total
that is gonna hurt
act
and he got 2 other questions wrong
nvm
i think
ok so 12 pts off
30/42
well
i think the other ones were like
that is 70%
3 pts
wait no
idk exactly
but still if it is 32/42 it is like 75%
im trying to use the spotify web api
what are u putting it in
im making a spotify client
called
cpotify
i have the playback functionality working
I solved world power
YES
world power
now everything can be powerd
lol
but
i mean
i solved that problem when i was 5
rip
with gear ratios
i said
if i use gear ratios to make it faster
then
i spin with one motor
but then its faster
on the other motor
which is the generator
so we get more energy
hahahahhaha
that is like electroboom infinite power molment
lol
spotify has like 6 apis
y 6
the whole thing is kinda weird
theres one for playback
one for control
one for data
and then other ones
probably one for artists
bruhh
one for ….
i have the playback one workoing
I mean in hindsite it makes things more efficent
cuz if u only need 1
yeah
bruhh\
I act kinda like that
I dont wanna do cp english
it is so easy
lol do honors then
and I pratically sleep in class
yup
i wish i did
idek what we r doing
neither do i
only works if u have premium tho
yea im not gonna try
that is why it bork
yes he did
also would 4gb ram be enough for windows 10?
yeah
i mean
you will be using swap and compression almost immediately
but if ur cpu is not bad
hmm okay
my english teacher took off a point for submitting an assignment 2 minutes late
it wasn't a timed thing either
like a long-term thing
and we had to get the last piece of it in class that day
so I submitted 2 minutes late
like WHICH teacher takes off points for submitting 2 minutes late for this kind of thing
and then she silently removed it later which is funny
Gente che parla italiano
mikaelo u shouldo joino
look at this quality software
this will be really easy with react
Cy can u kick me out of the chat and add me back it whenever I open the chat it says I have 2 @ ‘s
ok
Lmao it’s still broken
idk why
cant you like
mark as read
i think its swipe right or left
in the chats page
I think I fixed it by pinning the chat
ok
quality
i like cpotify already
even though i can't seek
shhuhuhsh
we will have that functionality soon.
seeking is now a thing
and it looks really nice
at least what i have now
cpotify
what is that for?
Wdym
whats cpotify?
just a pwa spotify client?
Yes but the idea is it will be actually good
i mean the spotify pwa isnt half bad
its just like the app
Idk imma see where I get with this one
yea
i like the normal spotify clients cause u can use em without premium
which is nice
wait
True
if u have adblock
on a pwa like spotify
Lol
would that block ads?
nah it wouldnt
It could
Maybe
wait it did
i just skipped like 30 tracks
an ad came up and then just skipped
i need to test this
I think you have to listen to each one for more than 30 seconds
i shall test it
i wanna know
if this is a viable way
Alternatively if cpotify detects you don't have premium
It could just use YouTube as the source
it could
cant it also just shuffle play ur playlists
The playback portion only works for premium users I think
But the rest of it
Like the controls and metadata and user data stuff
I don't think you need premium
intresting
what
tf
is
that
It's an iPod dock 🙂
*duck
this is exactly what im going to tell the next person who confuses java with javascript
lol watching the wan show
gpus available
at msrp

from this program
we will
right now
be putting up
30 gpus
slash
the name of the company that makes the chip
the name of this show
how you are watching it

We don't do democracy

cyfinfaza: democraramesh
I set the foreign poliCy
cyfinfaza: I set the foreign poliRamesh

Just use inter
and say
Cy doesn't do foreign policy.
Cy does Foriegn PoliCy.
cyfinfaza: Ramesh doesn't do foreign poliramesh.
Ramesh does Foriegn PoliRamesh.
Foreign PoliСy
cdknight: Someone, likely Ramesh, has said something that will not be translated.

I see
I will have to try that later
This is one of the features I like about windows, as you know
can i miracast to android
You can Miracast to Samsung devices
Although it's a bit finicky
You can also Miracast to Windows
can you do it over WAN
It's wifi-direct
i
There is no LAN/WAN
i do have wifi
Its p2p
i need to set up wifi
can i use it over ethernet
No you need a wifi capable device
fine
Actually it may need to be wifi-direct capable
*sigh
how do I check
But I think that's most devices
i have to install the wifi driver first tho
aka add a udev file
since my wifi adapter works with a driver
but the driver does not have the USB id
also i have to install bluetooth
I reinstalled linux
If you have a windows laptop
You can Miracast to that
If you wanna test
You open the Connect app
I don't anymore
I installed linux on my windows laptop
Um
lol
let me get the goddamn wifi working
Idk imma try this later
btw
wait
I gotta find it
?
Also btw everyone here
the second one is the actual size
I'm going rollerblading later
the first one
is the compressed size
i got auto fs compression
Cool
Do you wanna roller skate with me
no
Why
because I don't want to
Ok
Around 1:30
Aw I can’t I have a zoom thing
I mean
When does that end
Prob like 4
Oh
At the latest
Ok
Well maybe another time then
Yup
K
I have confusion
uh sig figs?
you do 0.5 * 1.5 M then you get 0.75 moles witch you convert by multiplying 142.05 g/mol of na2so4 to get 106.54
ooooo
so 106.5
um
0.150 is 3 sig figs
3
Yeah
but idk if thats the smallest amount
wait so then 107 g
yea try that
rip
Usually it tells you if SF is wrong
it dident
idk what I am doing wrog
sometimes it doesnt
wrong
this is my work
why 1.5 M
isnt it 0.150 M
wait
ahhhhhhhhh
it is
bruhh
thank for help
np
I am dumb
i cant read
No
Not signed up to take the bus
Ah
If so me and Matt require answers for last 2 questions
not yet
ill do it in a moment
Cy moment
im kinda tired idk why
i need to see what my parents want me to do
then after i do that
ill do the French assignment
and tell you what i think on the last 2 questions
what substance is alice adding to the graduated cylinder
bruhh they ruined screenshots
no they can't be too long
ooo
dude dr tong dosent do that
dr pernia is cool
thank u
lol until he tries to use edulastic
hA
then i get a 76% on a science test for the first time in 5 years
hahahaha
imma do that French thing
lol actually i had to watch a virtual recital
oh lol
it
OBS is trash
there
enjoy your webm file
its basically if you say I think "that something"
or it is bad "that something"
its the "that x"
something along those lines
i have to eat dinner
bye
ugh
i cant go to school tomorrow
i lost my wetip card
i would lend you mine
but
who thinks my vpn will work tmrw
what kind of vpn is it
it is
port 51829 udp
imma say 40% chance of working
lol
although
we shall see
they probably took down the firewall
lol
so idk
that would be funny
ill check if my proxy works
and ill check if my vpn works
i wanna make my own lighting console software
the thing is
it's not easy to turn off wireguard
cuz gnome suck
i might be sick tmrw
which would not be good
wait
what if i made a css-style cascading language for lighting presets
why would you be sick tomorrow
i mean
we all might be
so whatever
no im like
tired
and
im 98.8
which is
a bit high
for me
and my eyes feel hot
just listening to some cpotify
the glow may be a bit to spread out
key and tempo
its funny i only knew i could access that data cuz the PE teacher showed us this website
for an assignment
but it said "data from Spotify"
so i was like
huh
This is a nice website
Its convenient as heck
well guess what
cpotify now does this
automatically
on every song
Nice
But that info isnt really useful
I dont even need the key
I only use bpm to set my metronome
i like knowing the key
Make it a setting
btw that's not all the data they give you
Like musician mode
Where it add bpm key and whatever
i could do that
i could also add like
a button
or a right click
U could
one of the things i like with spotify is the "show credits"
it shows me the label and the actual ppl who wrote it
you find interesting stuff in there
Thats intresting
you can see if this person wrote it solo
or if they were working with a production team
you also find interesting things like
i found that a lot of the music i listened to was from just a few labels
but like
smaller labels
like mom+pop and Elektra
Huh
Yea no mine is def not
As expected
i have heard of that one
cy
wait
how
Idk
I will ask my parent
In a moment
what about the other one
did your other parent disappear
lol
No he's watching tv
ah
Downstairs
okay
understandable
Wait ramesh
if ur proxy doesn't work u can use mine
Where was this said
same with Ramesh and his vpm
vpn
Friday folder?
What day
K
i bet it will
no one uses wireguard
true
and im using a custom port
o then the school an't gonna find that
as I remember
OpenVPN did not work on udp on a random port
why
do they just block
idk
all udp
however,
it worked on TCP port 443
*sigh
ill have to test
also ssh is blocked
why does that matter tho
i cant ssh into my vps
and change the settings
just use the webssh
no
ill use my phone
or,
dont use a server
no
not an option
go serverless™
stop
lol
ramesh do you have 1 or 2 vaccines
i forgot
2
oh ok
my mom said
i only have 1
so it doesn't really matter
well
what should I do
lol do u have any idea
email the nurse
what if i go there
frankly i might do that too
that works too
and give them a copy
of my vaccine card
if you want
we can go there together
that was what
That’s what u should do
i was thinking
Just email a copy
na
join me after school tmrw
i was thikning before but after works too
Or fax it
ill prob walk home
YES
YES
I AM GETTING OUT MY FAX MACHINE
fax it
to the honeywell instant alert line
lol
No the nurses have a fax number pretty sure
oh deer
U can just fax the stuff in
i might just go after school
U could
Id email a copy
Its the easiest
ok if i get to school early enough tmrw
which i might
we go before
otherwise,
we go after
and i text u
sure
also
idk where any of my classes are
except apush
lol
what to do
oh well
ill follow the signs like an idiot
lol
i know where all my classes are
lol waidaminet
cuz u used to go
yeah
idk about gym tho
gym is gonna be an issue
gym is not fun
duh
no even less fun
did they make it worse
ok imagine gym at home
except everyone is watching you
and you are wearing a mask
and its 35 degrees celcius
ok but
everyone is watching me
at home
well not for me
i have what alankar called "god level" camera angle
cuz it looks up at the gods
so my teachers see a god
instead of me
cy
you should watch anime
i shall not at this time
maybe i will reconsider another time
That’s very random
that's very ramesh
no
I just htink like
it might be a match
nah
have you tried
i have issues
which i will not go in depth about
which prevent me
at this moment
from engaging in that culture
Hah
well I am the same
g l o w
oh i have to do the stupid like
"COVID screening form"
lol
can you tell me about this
quickly
and like
how the whole thing works
ok so
how they check
whatever
have your parent
sign in to genesis
ok
… then
they are prompted with the form
then
they effectively say
you have no symptoms
and then
submit
and then
it works
do i have to do anything in school
yes
will the covid police use an eye scanner
no
to detect i have done it right
jk
you go to genesis on your phone
*sigh
and you click "entrance pass"
and it has a number
oh god
ok
which is the same for everyone but ok
and if they do it it is green
if they dont do it
it is red
and they won't let you in
ah ok
ill
do that
you have to do it tomorrow morning
yeah ik
i am… somewhat versed in what happens
wait
what
i have lunch with mr harvey
yes
i will be interacting with mr harvey
quite a lot
these coming weeks
i wish my laptop would get off stupid preview builds
but it wont
so im stuck with preview builds
yippee.
Imagine having to wake up early
Tf
Do you really
Is anyone in school yet
I'm almost there
Meet me at the main entrance
Same
I will try
Idk what is the main one
Like in the front
Near the cafeteria
Yea there are two
Oh ok
Where in the car line are you
I'm coming in from cedar hill
Oh
Yeah I dont
Ill do that next time
Im coming now
Im in
I don't have lunch today
So no
Just send him a message on remind
Ok
wow
telegram
works
discord does not
*.io does
and wireguard doesnt
so ill have to try 443
or go for openvpn
I don't know anyone in PE
In my class
Ha
40%
Less than 50
I was right
Cy is sad
He wants to talk to someone
During PE
But no
u dont know anyone?
Not in my class
interesting
I mean Samuel and a couple others are in the room
But not in my class
windows RDP doesn't work
it used to work
windows RDP supports using relays though
but idk if that will solve this issue
WebRTC works
this is 100% a port issue
check anything that is not 80 or 443
or like whatever the DNS uses
and it won't work
Ha just use a proxy
From ur pi
Also yea it is weird that unigram works
I think cuz the school blocks certain applications like discord
And messenger
But don't know about unigram....or cy chat
Wait no chat
Or whatever it is called
nochat doesn't work
its on port 8080
cy2 browse works tho
cuz its on 443
yup its only 80 and 443 open
but i think i can get haproxy to make something work
i will see
I mean the school doesent have any blocks up rn
they block all ports
ooooo
cant discuss now
wait I hav proxy on
woops
and sry
vpn dead
lets make it work
im gonna iperf
443 udp
I'm gonna use haproxy
hold on
ok we are on
time to open 443 and 80 udp
they also block 22
actually i can try dns
they block everything
the dns port
except 80 and 443
yes
i tried
i think
i tested
dns port is open
cy
yes
so I can run wireguard on the dns port
wait i need to finish talking hold on
what is the dns port
ok bye
no
not bye
no I'm back
i have to use iperf
wait
do you wanna call
i like talking
53 usually
WAIT lol
voice communication doesn't work
telegram voice chat
doesn't work
wait ramesh
ok
so
i am going to proxy my vpn through haproxy
over realvnc
trusty realvnc
never fails.
haha
im trying netcat
and then imma use a variety of ports to do that
ugh
how do I test udp ports
i have to use ssh over my PHONE
why in gods name
uh oh
that failed...
nah
it's blocked
blocked
jk
i think
the school
throttled me for trying nmap
nah im not on btsd
what is nmap
network map
runs port scans
im on the clock
this is painful
i need to find a better way to test
im pretty sure DNS port works tho
u could use that
what is it
67?
53
i think
yea
ur right
thats what i used as a dns port for bind9
ill try it
wait
cy said minecraft port is open too
imma try that first
oh
wait
thats
but thats tcp
no
so
they allow
80 and 443
for all
but
allow specific ports
for specific outbound ips
so like
well so their dns is probably local
like in the router
but
oh i see
like
ill try 443 first
google dns
is probably not blocked
uh
443 works
wdym
on my phone
vpn?
yes wait
I'm trying to get it to work
why dont u guys try btsd_guest
there is only btsd_guest
they dont have btsd?
idk
i can't see it
I got kicked
From btsd
I think
spoof ur mac
I might have to change my mac
Yea duh
no i don't have it either
looks like
they blocked 443 udp
lol
i forgot to change hte port
I'm trying 443 tcp
but its not working
?
looks like 443 udp dead
i think
they are blocking
dns
i need to figure out how to get OpenVPN to work
wait
i think
dns is not blocked
imma try
you can arbitrarily connect to dns
no what
ok back on btsd
443 udp blocked
53 should work
53
huh
imma try
give sec
imma try too
i look like im hacking rn
which is perfect
lol
huh
it is
blocked
it is like
its like
they are checking what kind of traffic
not throwing that error
but
its not connecting
wait
ramesh
can you change the domain of your vpn
without changing the keys
wdym domain
like where it is
yes
ok
ive done it before
so i just need a port that works
hold on
lol i didnt
change
port
wait
have you gotten anything working
at all
ramesh
wait
wait
wait
just wait i may be onto something
ok
huh
so it blocks by traffic too
how
idk
lol
no
wait
ik
HUH
wait
what
it works
not really
yep
im on vpn
HA
port 53 WORKS
tcp?
or udp?
wait
udp port 53
ok lemme try that
my image wont upload tho
:(
there
it uploaded now
lets GO
not working for me
it works for me
i probably configured something wrong
yes
it works 100% for me
check your firewall
wait ur using wireguard
yeah
i am accessing discord
I'm on openvpn
right now
ovpn uses tcp right
just use 443 in that case
no
you choose
its udp by default
make sure nmap
works
how do you nmap
that might not work
is it there by default
nmap
on windows idk
wsl u have to install
probably
also ramesh
what
meet me by the front entrance
when school ends
yea
we will go to the nurse
im walking home
also
and walk
yep
I'm installing nmap
imma try it
if it doesn't work
also cy
imma try on mobile data
btsd
might be hidden SSID
it probably is
wait
WAIT
does it work
it works for me
no for me it acts as WPA-Personal
not WPA-Enterprise
btw michael
my VPN works
ooooo
also I saw yu in the hallway michael
what port did u use
53
DNS port
im smart right
y 443 not work
udp
o
I mean
u could have gone the dumb way
and use a proxy on ur pi
this is faster
i tried nmap
in wsl
it doesn't work
show me ur speedtest michael
ok
ignore it
just
try connecting anyway
yea
no it won't connect
thats a wsl thing
either
um
do you want me to scan for you
wdym
i can try nmap
I think speedtest is breaking my pi
is my ip
vpn off
53 port
?
ok wait
i turned off my vpn
since nothing is blocked on the vpn
lol
it's up for me
my ip?
yes
it is sending an image
ok so discord works if you already have it open
wait
they did a bad job of blocking discord
lol
that's tcp
i have the vpn set to udp
👏
no i tried tcp as well
hold on lemme try again
try
udp
53
that is what is not working
and what did not show up in your nmap
try udp
i just did
and…
it didnt work…
?
lemme do it again
do it again
mine works 100%
did you
open the port
what else does the school block
other than discord
yes
this is where it gets stuck
try
wireguard
idk how
it's faster
how do i try wireguard
you have to generate a public key and private key on your server
public key and private key on client
and do 5 lines of config
that i copied from somewhere
how to i use wireguard
tell to me
u dont even need to generate keys on both the client and server
the commands
idk
i have 5 minutes
on windows
no server-side
theres a gui on windows
i just made a server key and then let my clients have said key
server side idk on windows
ik how to do it on linux
wdym
my server
is a pi
i need the commands to install it
ok
wait
here
just copy that
this one seems right
But change the port to 53
hey ramesh
so its working sorta
so the first thing
that does not work
instead
i run wireguard on 51820
and then forward port 53 on the router
to 51820
so then i connect
then i do an address scan
then i port scan that ip
and i find all the ports of my pi
so it is working
but
it is not actually sending Internet requests
i have to go to drama club
but if you find anything
lemme know
this time I installed it with pivpn
so it should work
but idk maybe its conflicting with openvpn
maybe i should use docker
idk
i gtg
hi i
didnt see it
iptables? idk
should I run a wireguard for all of you
i might get into more trouble
it would take
two lines of code
to add anyone who's interested
but it might cut our bandwith
how do I convert an svg file to an inline svg file cuz im workin on a website for my portfolio in gatsby
um
calum did that
idk how to
ok ima ask calum
ok
ah discord
is getting funny
I figured it out
its called
OSC
yuh ramesh sent me weird question
its how I will talk to eos
bye
yes
you really think
lol
lets just say ramesh is having some fun
play along if you want
cy has figured it out
for real
it works
now
all I need to do is emulate a knob or something
so I need to get a python websockets server working
which I already have
then a websockets client working
that can transmit accelerometer data
which I already have
then the server needs to send OSC commands
to eos
the funny thing is that no one can do a really good job of being me
you can try
.center {
    display: grid;
    place-items: center;
  }
no way
Yeah but flexes are better
lol
wireguard works
and it works very well
wireguard is nice
i like it
ikev2 is also not bad
but its super annoying to set up
stop
i don't want to know what's better than wireguard
i have this
i am happy
pretty sure its the best
so ur good
ok
cy do u hav lunch period 8
Gym sux
Already
lol
have fun
they said they're going to like badminton or something
so it should be fine
lol
meet me at the main entrance
after school
and we can walk
No
I have to go home early
For physics retake
So im using the bus
Ok
STUN
yes
i know what that is
I had to use it in WebRTC
although the WebRTC system deals with it all for you
but yeah it essentially allows you to figure out what is and is not blocked
so i would presume fancy vpns like nordvpn
use something like STUN to figure out which ports/protocols they can use
and then ensure that they will work
dammit
the Sensors API requires a secure context
asdjflaskjdfh]
how can i trick it into thinking it is running in a secure context
omg this is driving me insane
why
why
why
whalskjdhf
the solution
is chrome://flags
1950s sexism
culture evolves
this was how we were in the 1950s
JavaScript has entered the chat
"im a spaceman"
alice graham's hiccup
wbeassing
hey guys, it's online school
"this meeting has been ended by host"
i want
the gold squiggles
kwality
I think ima buy dodge coil
coin
it is like at $0.30
and it went too the moon
so im like the coin
will make me money
damn
DAMN
so I think ima put 1K in it and see what happens
it was at 0.13 a while ago \
yea
if it goes up to like .45 u made some nice money
cuz I mean if it keeps doubling that is gonna b moneeee
and if it go to dollor then ima make alotaaaaa money
its easily gonna get to a $1
in like a few years
yuh, im thinking now to sell like 10k worth of stock
and j put it in doge
its a 1/3 of the way there
and see what happens
yea
mabye dont do that
id say put 1k in
or maybe btc
but doge is cooler
yea
doge
it would make u more money
cause u can get so much stock
true
cuz I wanna sell my stock before new capital gains tax stuff
ah wait
yea thats a thing
cuz then I would be taxed like 80%
uh
and Im like bruhh
technically
cant u open like a roth ira account and put the money into it
so it doesnt get taxed
or was it real estate
i have tried that, BUT, i need like a stable job and i only have a summer job
u can put the money into something to avoid the tax
true
i have a 529 tho
yea i think so as well
so i put monee in mutual funds and it go up
and it no tax
or
u could put it into a market fund
and let it grow
yea, that is my plan with my 529
that also would make money but idk bout tax
yea go for it
wasnt it 11/15% tax?
or did they increase it
plan, ima sell a bunch of stock and buy rocketlab before ipo, and in the process buy 1k worth of doge
they did
ugh
not bad
i would be careful of the ipo
but it should be fine
….
WHAT
yea
39.6%
Ah wait
and it is already at like 54%
earning more than a million
in nj
true
but
more than an million is like all ur income in stocks
since u dont have an income i think ur tax should be lower
no cuz i hav to use my moms ssn
valid
ah
then yea ur getting taxed
why
is it so much
holy heck
cuz biden is dumb
and stupid
he spendo much moneee
lots
giving people stimmys
and im like
wall street im assuming is pissed
hekkk yea
there is gonna b alota tax fraud happning in the future
i mean
and alota us firms are gonna go to like burmuda
yea if u route the money it should be fine
or wire it to a overseas account
but i no do tax fraud
yea dont
i would
cuz i dont wanna turn out like my great undle
LEGALLY
uncle
get around it
yea, i still couldent sleep at night
i would j pay my taxes
and complain
yea
i would honestly
whenever u get a stable job
open a roth
yea
put the money in that
then use the money in that and invest in real-estate
bam
cuz like that would b after collage tho
well
thats a retirement account pretty much set up
undergrad
yeaaa
yea
and u be swimming in monee then
yes
i honestly wanna buy a property in ny
but they
EXPENSIVE
yeaa, but they cheep now
but
cause covid and stuff
ny needs republican mayor
to clean up crime
like guliani did
and then it gud
yup
clean up crime and stuff
cuz before it was like bad place
now it back to bad place
hopefully it gets better
yea, cuz i love ny and i wanna live there
ny is a real estate haven
but i dont wanna get shot
yea
yea
im trying to convince my parents to like go a foreclousure and try bidding on some properties
i would not buy properties there yet cuz regulations
once regulations lift and price gud
in a bit
then buy
but during this time
cause they r a lot of foreclousures due to covid
ye
also i gtg
yea class
cuz class b changing
yes
Ok
Meet at front entrance after class
advisory is a thing
it is
I am bored
Imagine going to advisory
lol
im in school
also imagine having to record gym videos
haha funny lolz
lolz
Lolz indeed
Those suck
haha lolz imagine loser
imagine not being able to just
do gym
like normal
like we are going to do
I mean i havent had to do one in about 2 mp
cy i want to do this thing and figure out how much of our school  is vaccinated
since like
I showed mr Harvey the spinney lights thing
But i dont wanna jinx it
a lot more people
and he was like
Cy.
This is the coolest thing I have seen you do.
Since almost blowing up the PAC the night of the show...
ok...
proceed
how
how. um
lets see
i want to figure out the percentage of each class
Um
U need data
wdym each class
like
freshman/sophomore/junior etc
-freshman
since none of them qualify
ok
um
so
if you want
you can ask
to post a poster
with a qr code
ppl can scan
and say if they are vaccinated or not
Or u could do the very very annoying thing and start an email chain
YES
Yup just throw a google form in it and watch the world burn
distributed computing
to the next level
Or
Wait nope u cant do that
or you could ask the nurse
U can just ask the nurse for covid vaccine statistics
say its for a study
Well
Isnt it protected info
it is if its per individual
but
if you just ask for broad numbers
and percentages
that is not protected
Yea then just do that
although it might be a bit difficult
idk if they wanna provide that data
or if they have time to get it
I think this
But if u say its for a study they might
tbh I'm not that interested in this
but if Ramesh is actually that interested
go ahead and ask
it won't hurt
Yea
See what the nurses say
They prob can give u the percents u want
akash wanted to set up a vpn
wait
would you let akash connect to your wireguard
I told him you were about to let me
so I said you might let him
wait
btsd is back
wait
is it back for you
Ah
Ill log in
Why does it say action needed?
Login?
Cy what was the configuration again
Ik no ca required
Idk
What id it
Wastem
Stem123
Yeah
Lowercase
Ok
Also
What kind of inner authentication
Idk
PEAP
?
it gave up
Wait
mschapv2
what do I put for this
Considering the schools security and how lack luster it is
Um wpa?
Whatever the default thing it is
is this right
Think so
Yeah
ths is the whole thing
U can also just login with ur account
cy said no
You can
It's slow
Nope wont connect
neither will it connect on my phone
did it work for you cy
They might have changed the password
Yeah
how to update fedora silverblue:
Sick
Welp it is what it is
why is it SLOWER without a vpn
wtf
?
How
it's actually faster
by 14kbps
this is how good wireguard is
je te veux, BTSD
Damn
lets write blanket
Well time to close my digitalocean account
Mabye
Idk
Its last 4 digits
yea
ur dad is gonna be mad
So they really cant do anything
Nah
His cards been leaked before
ah
my parents would get mad
As long as there is no charges on the card he cant reverse
He doesnt really care
Which they cant do anyway
They dont have cvv or full card number
Ill prob close the account anyway
social commentary be like
Yup
yeah I tried connecting and it doesn't work
there is no BTSD rn
although it did this sometimes last year
randomly
so maybe it's just a today thing
maybe tomorrow it will work
idk
Ill just use LoRaWAN for my internet connection
100 bits/second ftw
what does that mean
for you
do you have to go to the bus
no
im not going to
ok
docker
that thing has 16 cores
it would be fun to make it go to 1600% cpu usage
btw my load balancer works now
so it will not send all the jobs to one jrunner
it will distribute them equally amongst all the jrunners
why did pivpn default to quad9
even tho I told it to use cloudflare
Where are you
CSC
grafix
z
z
imma do that messages per day analysis on this chat
meh
not that interesting
No
Also it's too windy anyway
Its very windy
Idk why
I have created a masterpiece
jrunner5 could run on wasm
that would be really interesting
it would
but it would not work for codetools
it would
no the checking/running has to be server-side
it will be a binary so not super easy to cheat
if you can cheat you are probably qualified enough to not use codetools
lol
but its not good practice
eh
to do things that can be hacked
NVIDIA vGPU can be hacked
also you dont hack the binary
you hack its output
true
also its not a binary
its wasm
idk much about wasm but it sounds like some kind of compiled thing
wasm is a higher level assembly code i believe
its like
assembly that can be compiled for multiple architectures
you actually transcompile to wasm
then
the wasm is compiled into a binary at runtime
by the browser
but since its essentially 90% compiled already
that compile time is fairly short
hi
I need help
u mean
44.1?
not 48.01
idk try this
see if it works
wait
thats wrong
what is wrong
btw that first number .164 worked for the first answer
also this works
pbco3 has a molar mass of 267.2
pb + c + 3O
oh wait
not pb + 3CO
yeah
oops
ok
thx
np
EXCUSE ME
VERCEL
15s load times are unacceptable jsyk
someone tell me when we learned about Java's order of boolean operations in apcs
Um
Third?
Cause the first one doesnt pass
False || false
Which is false
see i was like
nothing prints
I could be very wrong
because
true || true
is true
and true && false
is false
so the first one doesn't pass
and the second one doesn't pass
but
&& comes before ||
so
the second one is
true || true && false
which is
true || true
which is true
Nice
luckily "nothing prints" was not an answer
which makes me even more confused
but at least i didn't get it wrong
well idk actually
Yea luckily
i might have gotten it wrong
by missing something else
but like
stackoverflow
smh i hope there isnt anything else i need to know that they didn't teach us
Terraforming mars
Ah smart
Idk what i wanna write about
it just has to be 2 paragraphs right?
ur background statement and then whatever u wanna write about
2 pgs
Yuh
ugh idk
its 15 points so i might just kinda butcher some idea up
im dying
i need ideas
Write about
Something u can explain to ppl
yea i think
Like I rember u did hack the box
So like explain that
I could
i was thinking
i did a topic for that informative speech we did a while back
about living life in the moment
i can right something similar
Yea and do like an inspire thing
under the guise of inspire
yup
Dog
that
is a fluffy doge
Indeed
ah i should buy some doge now
wait
i could write about crypto/inform
imma do that
thats super easy to write aboiut
and can take up a page easily
lol
yes
tornados
that looks so weird
tornado
yes
the only true answer
?
this extension is malware
Report it then
i think its gone
but i still have it
it redirects all your google searches to bing
its a really useful extension
but like
it also does this
Thats annoying
very
anyway just a psa if for some reason you have that extension
Yea i dont install extensions
I only get like adblock and moneyscript or whatever its called

they are changing the windows font
i just realized the fonts on my computer look a little different than they did before
just slightly
and there's a new font preinstalled on my computer

Oh ok I thought it was due tomm
Wait
We should check
I’ll try to get most of the data in
Ok
If you do that then I can start making graphs
And processing the data
See I might have time today
But I have to do the HAL timed write prewrite and like 2 or 3 webassigns
And my family wants to go to liberty state park
Also I tried to check but I don't think she posted anything on it
I just remember her saying that she was going to be a "generous dictator" and provide us with 2 extra days next week
literally no one: 
windows: mmm yummy license
right
that's a thing
That script is so useful
yea
it even does office
can you send me it
How?
Does it give ur account an office license or just activate it on the pc
i think single pc but i havent checked
i can check tho
I have started
Yea i am curious
YES
YES
to the moonnnn
the problem is that nvidia GRID is a bit laggier now
i have to disable FRL
How much u gonna buy?
idk, ima put 10 bucks in j to try it out
tf is this
HAHA
I was thinkin bout that
welcome
It does all windows versions as well
ok imma disable FRL and change to 2q profile
on xen
thats so much easier
Do u need doge core or can u trade on a public exchange thing like coinbase?
u can use bolth
what I found was that td ameritrade did not soupport cryptos
Intresting
and I dident wanna do something like coinbase
Yea it doesnt
and with core I can mine
Idk the commission they take
Wait
Yes
and u can acc get dogecoins bc they are not as big
Imma mine doge
as like btc
yeaaaa
i gtg
bye
Adios
do you have clubhouse
nope
do you
want clubhouse
nope
what is it exactly
idk
i thought it was kinda like houseparty
ironically i have no idea what it is
anyhow looks like I ran out of vram since the qemu dm script is scuffed
I love the heaven music
Lunacy
Lol I already got my first dose last week
oh
lol
do yu love bill gates
Nah
More of an elon guy
lol
but like
bill gates love vaccine
he put microchip
i love bill gate
Hahahaha
i got two vaccine
i have twice the number of microchips than you
haha
i am cooler because i have more microchips
Sad
unigine heaven
I want microchips
in a virtual machine
Ooooo
That run p well
yea
NVIDIA vGPU
Do u hav windows 10 pro
yes
i
activated it
this
hhahaha
u pirate
"Pirate"
lol
And GH is microsoft
so technicall lmao
I just
I downloaded all of this software to activate windows from Microsoft
thats ironic
hahhaha, putting the microchips to use
yes billy gates will be proud
i need to buy a GTX 770
I need to take them from you
this is a bit expensive ngl
I have a quadro
what
Like a really old one
version
no I want to know what
model
i may be interseted
Quadro FX 1800
lol too old
i need a gk104 gpu
I come back hours later to check the progress of the doge and this is what I get
sync rate = supa slow
Shiba not happ
I found skechy thing online now im going Shiba speed
wait how?
mine is still at like 2%
so like before u can mine stuff u have to import the blocks
yea update the blockchain
well there is a file u can download and it giv blocks
so then u j have to sinc them
oh damn
imma do that
aslo what software u gonna mine with
idk
all of them look really sketch
yea
what were u thinking of using
i was gonna use cgminer
but i couldnt find a download link
so i then i went to nethash or whatever its called but it doesnt mine doge
bruhh
i was looking at yt videos
and j seeing what ppl use
reditt coming in cluch
they say mine eth
yup
and swap for doge
really
yuh
i saw alot of people say mine litecoin
and mine both at the same time
mining eth might be better honestly
doge seems hella complex to mine
yea im looking at stuff for eth rn
and yea doge is crazy
nethash
it has a dashboard and everything
ooooooo
i think the downside is that it pays out in bitcoin
which is weird
idk exactly how it works
i mean can u buy doge with btc
mine using a pool\
yeaa
if u find a really nice eth miner lmk
ok
i cant find anything decent that isnt malware
same
yo
do you know what nicehash is
its like cool crypto miner
they
opened an issue
softwere
and they're a company
they should be paying
this thing is to like circumvent nvidia licensing LMAO
haha
lmao
they got a nice lookin website and everything
I told Krutav to tell them to screw off
yea
And we have nothing to do with companies
looks like im actually involved with this project now
hahahah
yes the one time i decide to get into open source
it is for some project that borders on illegal
haha
lolll
also
they use arch
which is intersting
i think ima use a cryptotrader
this is getting sketch
i might just use nicehash honestly
when they openly say they want to violate license agreements
id be concerned
and get payout in btc
it makes it more sketchy since they dont care
then invest into doge
yea
yea
they apparently did that on an official nvidia repo too which is funny
that might be best
imma still mine tho
it gets u a few dollars
hi I changed my profile
nice
fancy new pf
I am changing it everywhere
except
it will be different colors
telegram gets light blue
discord gets purple
g-suite gets teal
dont u just love bash
Why would they not
Its elon
Soon I can buy a space launch
Yup
Now it will truly be
“To the moon”
Hahhahahahah
Except not the moon part
better
Thats alot of parameters
it gets the process id from an rsyslog log
Im trying to open a mobile wallet but u need id for all that
Which is annoying
U need all that
Damn
there
there
take that back
key word
dont use bash
I find it funny that if you set Microsoft edge's search engine to the far inferior "google" it brings up automatic results while typing
apparently this person does not actually exist
this program just generated it using AI
cy drags the "navigation" ui component into lunacy
entire computer comes to a halt
that
website
Thats an intresting website
Ive seen a lot of them do it but not with that little artifacting
Looks kinda realistic
its not a website
my gpu cant mine
i think my mac can prob mine but i aint gonna mine using it
Waaaaaaa
cy is making clones of ppl
is pfizer stock a good buy in your opinion
my mom owns some, I haven't looked at biotech stuff
but ima look into it
probably tho cuz like they b making gud vaccines for ppl all around the world
but the us gvmt would b like well I paid for the dev
so idk
But u gotta be careful
Hedgefunds might also do a good ol manipulating the market
Like dogecoin during elons snl skit thing
It dropped 29% when it was predicted to rise
yea
also I hav confoose
like the things no mach
nvm I think I am dislexic
when copying the equation on paper I like mushed 2 givens together
oops
yes
download on itunes
lets go back to the stone ages
I am so pissed, I got 3 pts off from my chem test
cuz of sig figs
i could hav had an a
idk
I havent done that webassign
imma try it hold on
fml it doesn’t want the negative
?
its 211.4
ok that's weird
idk how you get that
if I negate the first
and double the second
yeah it’s broken
i should do that webassign
but
i still have precalc
and French audio log
Also sry for l8 response
np I got it
i joined comp sci
is anyone talking
i was trying to
just move somewhere else
hopefully that would set an example
yes, ping everyone
big brain time
oh no
the sinc has completed
the mining can begin
what GPU
...baby 1060
how long did urs take?
im still on 35
like a few days
3GB 1060?
6
u dont need to even mine
SAME
lol
hahahaha
u get payed for folding@home
are you serious
serious?
rly
yea
rly
show me
if u join the team
imma get on it
^
i can vGPU
so
dude do they accept doge
dude
sdf
sdf
sdf
sf
]f
sd
gfsd
yes
YES dude
yes my dude
so run that and make some extra change while ur at it
this is best
YUH.
idk payout
but honestly i dont mind
i always have folding running anyway
same
this gets me some money for it
...in dogeeee
yea its dead simple
set ur identity to ur wallet
and join the team
get payed in doge
wait my doge address is too long it says
DHtE43fLCXhoqn16XAzL7ksFJm4yh8smZD
really?
i was able to set mine
like where u find it
the address?
file much reciving address
yea, it said it was too long
u dont need the #
ooo
now I b making doge
Vaccinated
Ppls
No
Have to wear masks
Hmm
yea I j read ardicle on that
sad that I only hav 1 shot
So but hmm
Like skool
U get second eventually
Then freedomz
lol the lunchroom mask gestapo cant touch this
where is this article
i am almost fully vaccinated
ok no that's the CDC
thats not NJ
or Bernards BOE
yea, but NJ gonna prob adopt it soon
NJ and Bernards BOE have to say its ok first
same with boe
yuh ik
but they go off of cdc reccomendation
true
my mom sent me some MIT robotics competition livestream thing
so they prob hold like a hearing and maybe at the end of school no mask
oooo
ima keep that in my background while I study for chem
reddit be like now the antivaxxers are going to wear masks to defy cdc rules
Hahahaahha
lol
thats actually not a bad future
vaxers get their vaxes and dont wear masks
which is fine
and antivaxers get no scary vaxes
but they wear masks
Cy trying to flash a numworks
?
Ive never seen mine do that
idk
it worked tho now
so
What did u flash on it?
omega
but
with numworks theme
Ah i see
honestly whoever thought to make the theme for a yellow calculator red
I forgot how that looks
Idk
I made my own theme which is like omega but more color variation
idk i like the original numworks theme
it appears I am finally going to get in touch with rfidgs
the CEO said she would call with me tomorrow when she could get the software guy
mouser sells intel CPUs
like
not desktop ones
laptop ones
FCBGA-1449
lol and cy dont study for chem test
it would have been funny if u changed it to raidians cuz I would not have changed it back and I would b doing all my math stuff in raidians
Change it to polish
my calculator when it turn to polish
i hate the new discord logo
Lol wtf is this
i hate it
It's like
Slightly different
worse.
In the wrong way
not different
yes
send this to Mrs. Tan and get it on the board in the comp sci room
this is
great
I honestly
there are people who send balloons with flyers into north korea
since they think it will liberate them
then people are mad that south korea is destroying civil liberties by prohibiting this
now THINK about it.
people
are sending.
flyers.
over an INTERNATIONAL border.
to ANOTHER country.
and that is apparently
destroying civil liberties by preventing this
this is like saying "I'll lob a box of chocolates over the border between the US and Canada" and thinking that is legal
Thats stupid
Exactly
Its an international border
There is a reason borders exist
No a better example is ill throw a box of chocolates from mexico to the us
Eh yea but with even more tension
India to Pakistan
Yea thats no bueno
Intresting
this gc died
unironically dead
Cause there is a lot of people
for what
this should b ur comp sci final project
j trying to get this on the bored
board
Ooo
I wanna know how much u made
same
I haven't gotten anything
but the thing says late saturday
I had to shut off my server so it didnt do anything
dude the doge
u need to make sacrifices
Yes
I will turn it back on
Wait i cant
But i am curious
w8 y u hav to turn off server
Lemme know how many points u contributed and how much u got
i contributed 65500 so far
Im packing stuff to go into storage
Damn
i mean it is only while im on my computer
Idk mine was folding with a 710 and 4 virtual cores
So it wasnt contributing alot
how much u contribute
0
I forgot how slow it is
rip
It couldnt even get through one work unit
I could fold using my mac
That would get me a decent bit i think
but that means mac slow and overheat
Exactly
So i dont really wanna
ima go study for comp sci
bye
Gl
thx
should I try folding on a GRID VGPU
Do it
Im curious bout performance
Actually
Can u mine with it?
yes
Ooooo
yea that would b rly intrsting to see
i just bought an 8gb pi
ooooooo
i also hav one
that is running my proxy
what u gonna use it for
ima prob get 0.014 doge
1 whole cent
but next week ima get 2 cents
cuz this week it was only mining for half a week
lol
what u do michael is
and then wait for the doge value to go up or whatever
and then sell it
that is for normies
well, that means i am a normie
ut o
dude in 2 years i will make 1 doller
dude i gotcha
just
take a visit to the bank of america
with lots of guns
and a few battering rams
and a few friends so you can party afterwards with lots of beer
hahahahahaha,
best way to get doge
the only inconvience tho is the fbi, but that is like supppppper minor
yea or just storm the capitol and sell the stuff u loot on ebay
even easier
it only took a few minutes to get in
hahahahhah fax
Damn
cy is learning about machine learning
the natural intelligence is training its neural network on the artificial intelligence's neural network
Hi i added Benjamin Chee
he has free tomato plants
Hello everyone!
(I'm Benjamin)
Free tomato plants, any takers?
Just tell me y/n and how many
I'll deliver them my 6/15
My mom said she would take 2-4
Depending on whether other ppl want them
I was doing the practice thing for comp sci and was like, what if I use an arraylist for this and make it super overcomplicated, well it worked
wait no it failed
i was looking at my other method
are they grown already?
what is this error
idk
the evolution
I am the error
Jkjk
Got it 🙂
Yep!
i swear to god
if that was the wrong practice test
imma f|
cy wtf
howwwwwww
I got a 30/40 and I was like happy
Ngl i would probably get a 39
Being completely honest
Hmm I might be interested on munching on some then
I did the retry one
But it should be the same, right?
Like difficulty wise
yea, also there are 2
cuz if so ima do that other one monday
i have a moderate headache rn
idk why
i may or may not be able to come into school tmrw
if it persists
I got my second dose yesterday
i was like not that dead
i got my second dose 10 days ago
the day after mine i was not dead but i got a short headache
yea, i j had a small headache the whole day
idk like suddenly im having all these headaches after the vaccine
lol the microchips are attaching themselves to ur neurons
lol yes
why on earth did I let the Russians implant such devices in me
they are out to kill me
idk, i think they j wanna make us buy their vodka when we older ngl
lol
machine learning is cool btw
yea, what were u running
i wanna learn about that stuff
i am establishing a basic understanding
what i was running was a demo
that allowed the computer to identify rock/paper/scissors from an image
ooooo, so like the nvidia software
also what does it run on
like do u need a special environment
so this is using TensorFlow
and it was running on Google Colab
oooo
next weekend or potentally like after the ap test during the week ima look into this stuff
also next weekend ima attempt my roket burn
cool
then i gotta go on the deb8 grind
lol
anyone: anything
Michael: i have deb8
cuz nat is like on the 28th and i hav prepped like 3 bills out of the 40 or so
have fun
but after nats and into june i hope life is fun again
i see
cuz like may has been a tough month
see the thing with machine learning
is that a good understanding of it requires a good understanding of calculus and image processing techniques
(for image processing applications)
so
ha, idk shit about calc
what im more interested in
is the applications
and how to actually manipulate, transport, and apply models
so for example
there is an ARM CMSIS version of TensorFlow Lite
that allows you to run tensorflow on Cortex-M devices
ooo so then u could use a machine learning alg on like a nucleo
yeah
but whats significant
and like stick it in a drone or something
is that i can run it in a low power environment
so i can create a battery-powered sensor
that has onboard AI
you would probably be able to get a pi or something on a drone
ooooo and then like collect mass amounts of data and send it over lora
well so
lora only lets you send like
5 bytes
but so
what you do
yea
but like
is you take 5KB of sound data
that should b enough
you process it
with the ML
and you decide
what is this sound?
then
you send a 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5
depending on what the sound is
so you take 5KB and turn it into 1B of actually relevant data
then you can send that one byte over lora
ok
or
u could like offload the entire application on a high frequency dmr signal
and then do the prossessing from a computer
and hav unlimited power
what is DMR
digital microwave raido
oh
the thing is
cost effective and power efficient solution
the problem is like
most tx/rx are very expensive, for both cost and power
whereas something like LoRa
is very cheap
true
and
very power efficient
my goal
is like
to be able to run one sensor
yea, but u would b limited on the amount of data u can gather
for 1 year
on one battery
that seems intresting
not neccesarily
see
it depends what you care about
then
i can just do the processing onboard the sensor
and only transfer that one byte
to get past the LoRa issue
yuh, but wouldent that prossessor use much power to do that
that's the question
but i would presume
like
if you are using a microcontroller
the power consumption is very low
that seems interesting to prsue
regardless
in fact
lemme check
i gotta do chem
ab
lab
81 mA at max load for an stm32f446re
at 3.3v i believe
450 uA/MHz
there are more power-efficient options tho
like the efm32
which does 225 uA/MHz
and if it turns out i dont need as much cpu as those have
then i can use a lower power one
cy accidentally woke up 20 minutes early
Why u wake up so late
Sounds good! Just dm me how many and I'll get them ready by 6/15
Does that mean you biked to school? 😃
Lol yes
Michael did not get any dogeeeeee
this is a sad day
Nooooooooo
Mine it then
honestly, ima j buy a bunch,
Or that
The easy way
i opened a robinhood account with the sole purpose of buying doge
Smart
and ima inject a bunch of money into it
for doge
If i were u i would invest in one of those hardware wallets
nah
Do it
i dont trust them
Doesnt robinhood give like 5$ free or something
yea
I mean its a hardware one so they r pretty secure
still, i would rather hav one on robinhood
bc that has a large backing behind it
True
I would get a couple coins tho
Diversification
yea they are dirt cheep
Whats it at now?
like 50 cents
also igtg
Damn
bye
Yea cya
wait, so its not private to everyone else?
I like throttlestop
thats some weird wording

Stay
Come to the pac
k
gracias
woah
urs loooks so nice
wth
lol I dident do the esthetics
Regardless
It looks so damn nice
c code
That's it
NVIDIA hates this 71 line file
since it kills their profit margins
ha
throttlestop is nice
what does it do?
my laptop has intel turbo disabled in the bios
so it won't turbo
it caps out at 1.58 GHz
and there's no way to enable it
but
if you run throttlestop
it takes control of the cpu from the bios
and then
you can uncheck "disable turbo"
and your intel CPU will turbo again
please choose a better logo
Good luck to everyone taking the AP comp sci test rn
should i get into the system
im launching the app
right
so
when i try and type the security statement in
the app just crashes
completely
so um
wait it worked
ok
Oh dear
I hope it doesn't crash during the exam
Frick you cursed me
My computer just crashed
oh no
is it back on
flexing on the guy in the discord
by telling them my implementation is superior
VMWare be like
Yeah my computer got revived just in time 🙂
welcome to jargon city
vskode is broakin
hahahah
r u trying to flash the machine learning software on a neuculeo or somethin
no im just trying to learn about the toolchain
its working
but for some reason vscode intellisense isnt working
this Friday I hav some free time so ima try and see if I can get a machine learing thing to go onto my neuculeo
ok
rip yt is ded
procrastination dont work
I dont get doge
and I hav a bunch of chem work
sad
lol I ask Alex Ingraham to choose a random color for his html text
hahahahahahaaa
its almost like they wanted the color to be represented by its hex name
yes
i wish i got this joke
i can buy a whole pixel 3a for the price of a pixel 3a xl front display
Lol this is my math hw
Don't ask about the tape
?
Unit circle project?
yup
like the first one
Ah my bad
I believe it was 1/4
But its prob late to say that now
yea, I got it, I was not sure cuz I ran out of tries
40% of ap exams are done
2 down, three to go
bruhhhh 5 ap classes
Yes
I made a little something
it can display cards
and switch themes
and it looks ok
do you have time to call/discuss
yes
ok
give me like 2 mins
ok
are you working with MLeo on this
Cy
and MLeo
for the apcs thing
yes
Interesting
ok Im ready
can we call on telegram
yeah
Raspberry Pi has a UEFI
yeah i recall there was something like that that they added recently
😊
What
Why did it send a smiley
Lol
Lol
😀
What are you doing
Time to run VMs on my pi
Rpi virtualization
On my brand new 8gb pi
I see
andronix
aka ubuntu running xfce on termux
ow frick
what is the name of that benchmark
my phone is hot
it burned me
i furgot
silverbenchmark
ok let me try
in chromium
on what
on a VM
on a raspbery pi 4
ok
im guessing around 2000
maybe 2500
im guessing
2
?
oh now im guessing more like 700
cuz when i tested the pi
i was on 4 native cores
should i install ublock
and i got 3300
idk
idk if that would speed it up
on my desktop
with a vm running
and a buncha apps
i get like 30k
oh god
7
i bet
that will be the score
imma increase the number of cpus to 4
ok
what
is wrong with you debian
oh right i also need to get a cooler for this maybe that's why it's so bad
my 3300 was without a cooler
actually there might have been a fan
blowing on the cpu die
lol
Phone
ap gov = the biggest joke
- you really thought AP classes were hard? think again
- introducing ap GOV
- legit all the quizzes are open note
- i said QUIZZES for a reason, there arent any tests
- you can legit just look everything up in the textbook and be 100% fine
- there are a few projects at the beginning of the year but the teacher gave up by the end so lmao just free quizzes
- the course is so short that they have to legit add a filler econ unit in the middle 
- did i say there werent any tests?
- and the ap test is also a joke, i legit ate a full lunch between the two sections
lol
i literally dont remember anything
honors precalc
- the hardest class at ridge
if you survive then you passed the test
bruh
Cuz the cables in the monitors are dp
But they have HDMI ports on them
I thought h chem or h alg2 wasss
im fucked next yearrr
bruhh
Lol no
dont ask why, but i have an hdmi cable in my bag
do u need it
Why do you have it??????
XD
idk, i think i was grabbing my charging cord for my computer on my desk in the morning when u are in like that zombie mode and dont rly know what is happening, and i grabbed an hdmi cord
Thx
Now we can yeet esxi next period
sick
yooo intellij nice
ooooo
bit late tho
join 4h
in deb8
oh
have fun
it will end at 740
join if u want
I can come after tho
ok
cuz we doin a showcase
ok
Yes
who is the user on the right?
also is that facebook
is it still 2010?
yes
hm
also i think it's an ad
attempting to stream h264 screen capture over the network with hardware acceleration
the latency is not that bad but on my linux laptop it is even better
like it feels really smooth
this is over UDP
I might just make parsec for linux
dang thats nice
i think its slightly off
yeah obviously
i copied random stuff from a github gist
and another github issue
yea but its good
the next step is to move this stuff to C
thats how u made it so smooth?
i wanna know what th u did
yea but i understand what they r doing
see im trying to make parsec for linux
like linux hosts
do it
i feel bad just copying this guy's stuff but like it works
uh
it uses a screen capture thing called kmsgrab to read the framebuffer and then it encodes that into an mp4 stream using VAAPI hardware acceleration and then netcats it, which effectively creates a UDP stream
then you take that UDP stream and decode on the other side using mpv with some finetuning parameters
Huh
So its not using parsec or anything like that
Intresting
no it is a reimplementation of parsec basically
parsec is just this but instead of kmsgrab it uses a windows thing called DXGI
Huh
"wait cy, do you not… remember how to do multiplication…?" (in the most serious tone possible)
- Calum
"option dollar times ten"
when windows explorer uses 3GB of ram
cy
i patched a binary for the first time in my life
and it worked
cool
i like edited the assembly instructions
it was a kernel module on esxi
*contentful*
also cy
i will use like colors to show what is science and tech ect is what tent
Ok
also I talked to my parents and grandparents and other ppl who go to the 4h fair and they said that they would prefer to have a simple map with like the general area of where things would be
So like in the old app?
and on the names of the areas I would make be like "dogs:
"dogs"
I showed them a ss i took of the old map and they said it was too complex
Huh
Ok
Please present this at the next meeting
ok
so i came up with ieda
Also you should be discussing this in our discord
So all members can see
o
i will send ss then
Ok
should I reflash to omega for AP tests
Do it
but i have tetris installed owo nowo
tbf i dont think they will care but like ill do it anyway
Oh no
Thats
Not good is it
it's saturday
i copied the screenshot off of the collegeboard website
Ah
I thought that was on ur thing
i hope it wont be
this article
legit all the comments
are like "bro this looks off hes definitely a white supremacist"
it is so dumb
Yea
Its very
I dont think they realize
I used this as evidence in an english essay
Thats a natural progression for ur fingers
the problem is it makes me doubt whether or not the article is credible
but like
this is the new york times
the commenters are idiots
but like there is so much of the stuff right that it starts getting to you
it's interesting
epsilon has new graphing features
so the graphing window is no longer god-awful
wait send picture
i wanna see it
the auto and equal axes
wait the new omega has it too now
so if you upgrade omega you will get it
that looks so nice
i should
what if we built another emu for numworks
like an SNES one
is that possible
You could write some arm assembly for your numworks
right but that would be no fun
i mean maybe
if we write a custom OS for the numworks
um does it?
it does
i just built from source and mine doesnt have it
omega 15.5
did you pull
What
1.22.1
The auto axes
?
yes
i dont need to pull
I have that
i just checkout
And I built from source
Stable source
idk
ill re clone it
Did you pull
Try pulling
I had to pull
aww im sad
my custom theme no longer works
I am scuffed I fone
That is very scuffed
i thought mikel had a not an iphone
oh yea
ios launcher lol
Machine learning for fiber optic shape sensing based on speckle pattern
Machine learning is interesting
And it actually worked
oooooooo
i am true speed
idk
i have it all done
For all 20 ads?
yup
60 sentences
the thing is
she doesn't actually have an assignment on classroom to submit it
so
if you dont have time its probably fine to do it tmrw
This is getting heated
And looking good
Cuz like sideloaded apps are sketch, but apples iap are like supermonopaly
Yea
I like the idea of the sideloading propositon tho
what they should do is kinda the same as what osx does
have two security options, one where app downloads can only be done throught the app store and the other being from the internet and verified developers
ye and it block downloads unless u dont disable thing
for those....ppl
I would also like to see where other app marketplaces can be downloaded from the app store so u dont have to go to the internet
yes
i guess i have to learn sql
what have the AP tests done to me
1 + 1 = 3
for extremely large values of one
no
yes
as 1 approaches 1.5
1 + 1 =3
cy is facing a dilemma
the limit as 1 + 1 approaches 1.5
regarding databases
and apis
what is the cylemma
smh
the dilemma
is
what to use
supabase? dgraph? mongodb+python? wait does dgraph need an api for authentication? firebase?
supabase is nice but their free plan
hold on
"pauses"
your database
and your whole api
if no one uses it for 7 days
its another 500mb for free deal
why dont u just
selfhost it
well the idea is
its completely free
what do you think of this image
not now
after
so is selfhost
no so
what i want is this:
rapid development
fully free hosting
all in the cloud
to permit for rapid website launches
cy.
then ill pay if i actually need more
what.
w
wh
?
lol
i made a bad joke
yes
you did
lol haha very funny lol
lol
um
AWS student free tier
no
and host any DB on it
no deals
free for commercial use
oh god
abuse netlify to run a database
i think
the answer is supabase
i think
i need to be able to access and mutate data from a web client
can this do that
the thing with supabase
is their first tier paid plan
is $25
but
implement SoG
i suppose
SQL over Git
if i wanted to
i could just self host
yes.
also you could just use free tier
when i need more
IIRC
wait
?
free tier expires or doesnt
i dont remember
no
no the thing is like
doesn't expire or does expire
what if i need 1GB
and for my app not to "pause"
does not
then
then i self host
selfhost the data part
not the db
?
like
wireguard over to ec2 and mount nfs
i am not
using
wireguard
.
.
for anything
...
........
.
.
.
.
fine
i got u
hear me out cy
just hear me out
before you say a word
ec2 free tier running database.
a word
then.
rclone mounted google drive folder
for db storage.
-blinks-
ok im done now
no
the answer
is
supabase
selfhosted
on vultr
if i need more than their free tier
cringe
ok
i just migrate my data over to the selfhosted one
why
*cough wireguard *cough ramesh
cringe
just
just what
just selfhost
lol
onsite host?
yes
what if i care about reliability
in the Data Cynter
and "set it and forget it"
yes you run a data cynter
what if my house loses power
what if i have to perform maintenance
univesral power cyply
PaaS and SaaS has no maintenance downtime
backup cyerver
upc
dont worry
its not set in stone
what is mrs harding showing us
is this acutally somtething they showed
it has
expletives
ex-pleet-ivs
fake news
regardless of gender, if u wear something that shows more, this is gonna happen
sexual dimorphism exists in humans for evolutionary reasons, as it does for many other animals. however, as a civilized species, we must create a dynamic that can handle said dimorphism, in a way that is in everyone's best interest. males and females must both contribute to said dynamic.
You see
I think that this picture is misleading about sexual dimorphism
C WHY CANT I JUST SET THE RSP REGISTER
I HATE YOU
INSTEAD OF CASTING TO VOID* CANT I JUST SET RSP
can you elaborate on sexual dimorphism in humans
what are the characteristics
etc
you know
the characteristics
i need not elaborate
i actually don't
yea, but this is evident in males and females equally. So in both cases sexual dimorphism would be present if the male or the female exhibited behavior that is sexually provoking
I feel as if males do not sexually provoke females as much with their clothing
For example, as in that statement, men do not tend to show much of their "legs, shoulders, or chests"
bruhh, at the beach men dont wear shirts
also l8 night yt b like
this is at school tho
HAHA RELATABLE
im actually
trying to hack an nvidia enterprise software rn
and it is
not working
ha u resorted to binary operators
i will resort
to literally
patching assembly code
if this doesnt work
im mad
cuz it was working
rip Ramesh
also back to this, women should not b wearing those kinds of things at school cuz it is j not appropriate
like men dont go to school with no shirt on
girls go to school with no pants on
yea...put on some pants
i mean
i dont actually understand
wont it be cold
yuh
they are going out of their way to do it
for what reason tho
to b provoking probably
I dont understand women
ok
but then
dont make that statement
you know
the picture
ye
and you complain when someone calls you out for being provoking
then
thats just
yea, I was originally calling bs on the picture
i was j adding to this meening that it applies to men and women equally
I think so
but girls kinda seem to exhibit no sexuality
so idk
same
What the f is this conversation?!?
my stating my observations
SQL IS DRIVING ME INSANE
HOW DO YOU DO THIS
supabase is driving me nuts
i just wanna prevent a user from creating more than 2 db records
and i cannot, for the life of me, figure out how to.
Its as if ABSOLUTELY NO ONE needs to prevent their users from spamming and filling up their database
asdfasdfalksdjf;alkdsjf;alksdjf;alksdjf
how u solve these
1/whatever kc is
its flipped
so kc is the reciprocal
ye, but u would hav to calculate that and u dont got the numbers
wait
make an ice chart that goes to the right
ur given kc
ye, I j realized
im dum
and instead of using 0.250 use 3
much thx akhil
this one is 32
cause subsitute 1
and think it through by doubling and stuff
but like 1^2 = 1
from my understanding since this is the common ion effect or something but choose the smaller values and stuff
yea
1 = (1)(1)^2(1)^3 is a true statement
so if u double one
oooooo
i see
? = (1)(2)^2(2)^3
32
yeaaa, i was thinking of doubling the exponents
not the act reactant
yea
how would u do 2 then
?
ah that one
like this 2
since its solubilty from what people have told me
its to choose values that are smaller
ooooooo
much thx akhil
np
smh
ha
oh believe me i'll never forget
im trying to find a domain, but there are none
and even if I go to the ones u gotta pay for they are not available
what domain name u lookin for?
alphonse
idc about .me or whatever
I could have like alphonse5
or something like that
FINISHED ALL THE AP TESTS
YES
about to start my last one
*this year
Seminar?
yes
whats it on
argument analysis
and then this really subtle essay thing
where you have to write a perspective on an issue
they give you a bunch of sources
and your first instinct is to write a paper on the issue
but that is wrong
do not do that
you must write a paper on a different topic
the analogy was
say you are at a table with family at thanksgiving
and they are talking about an issue
you have to introduce yourself into the conversation
and you do not do that by restating everything they said
you do that by introducing your own thinking
and bringing in information from what they said
ima go now bye
lol that is me every thanksgiving
lol
what
tell me more
oh
i cant read
lol
ha
i should learn to read
but like
same
i just took an ap english test
reading bork
so like imma forget how to be literate now
i have to purge ap ptsd
hahhahah, I forgot how to java after cs exam
i was like, bruhh what is class
haha relatable
actual icaths ptsle;
i cant
spel
well program in general
so
soh
ai shud taek brake
bai
bye
hav fahn with roket
lol
i dont hav to take an ap test to forget words
GOOD LUCK CY!!!!!
YOU GOT THIS!!!!
Thanks!
I'm all done with it now
I think I will do ok
It was not that bad
Rip power
Rip kids taking an ap test rn
Lol yes
Do u know
Which one it is
Rn
Lol csp
Only 2hrs tho
I'm actually really lucky
I was taking it on a desktop
This was the one thing I was fearing about that choice
U guys lost power?
Luckily
For a few seconds
Interesting
I need to now finish aphug hw
And Study for aphug
i feel bad for you
yea well its aphg
most colleges dont even accept the class
so im taking it a bit easy
lmao
i wanna take seminar next year
over lit
so my ap score doesnt really matter for it
i have to email my guidance counselor
do it
i wont be able to handle the stress of lit next year
i know my limits
so it's either honors lit
or
ap lit with no exam
or ap seminar
u could
that was the option
not take the exam and just do the course
then i remembered someone told me she isnt going to take lit and take seminar
so i realized that was a thing again
so i want to do that
ig
its not a bad option either way
i shelved it and then remembered today
so im considering
im also gonna take ap physics C not 2
just not take physics 2
oh ur jumping from 1 to 3?
why not 2
is it bad
i dont have to take 2
i HATE chem and the stuff in 2 is like chem stuff
like
ah
thermodynamics
fluids
gases
so
like i actually liked kinematics and whatever
it was challenging but like also fun
like i probably got a 100 on the cumulative test
do it
im dying rn
should I just drop my final average in calc is an A+ to flex or no
it is kinda relevant
…
sure
but i just want to flex more
It's probably less than an AP science or APUSH
apush was free
Also if you're good at managing your time
But it's new stuff for most people
I am awful
at managing time
I mean
Frankly
I think it's not a bad class
But you would be taking it senior year
yeah
Research is the one to do
uh
But you won't be able to do that
you have to take seminar first
frankly im just consider this since someone told me I could
instead of english
Idk seminar is fun if you make it fun
I can talk about this later
i want to research something vaguely specifc
I'm on my phone
okay fine
ok
I was at my sisters confermation when the power went out so the preist was like, jeasus is showing you that he is present
while all the old ladys for some reason screamed
I'm here
...
Wait what is a confermation
I hear it mentioned
christan thing where u become an adult in the christan church
Ah
So like whatever that thing is for jewish people
yea
Makes sense
lol
for me the power cut the second I pressed the power button on my esxi vm
they are stupid
u start cramming the day before the day before ur test
but yes i am also kinda in the same boat
but im aphg
its not as bad as ap bio
I am thinking of taking ap bio next year instead of ap enviro
i am no hippie, but it is an easy a for 7 credits
but i might wanna do stuff with bioengineering in collage
I wanted to
But then i settled on either econ or math/stats
yea, I think ima stick with roket
lol, then I gotta take some ap chem
And fysicks
yea, I was gonna take that anyways
U could double up next year
like ap fysiks 1 and ap fysiks c
i already am with enviro
Do both fysiks and chem
Ah
but like, ap chem
*ptsd with gas law test*
Yea
i mean is ap chem better
like hav u heard anything
Nope
bruhh
Idk anyone that takes it
I mean i used to know someone who did it
But they long gone
rip, what u doin next year
for szience
Ap fysiks
Thats a given
what about with the other ap class u can take then
Ap econ
cuz like elective period
ooooo
i was thinking about that
and was like, i can j take the ap test without the class
Yea its not a bad one to take
U could
I was thinking bout doing that with cs
yea, cs is chill
wait
how can u take another ap
r u droping language
Nope
cuz fsks u gotta take a study hall
Yea i then get one elective slot
Cause i finished all my credits
So i dont need actual electives like arts and stuff
yea, so that goes to macro right
Believe so
I think it does both
so u cant take another ap
wait i am a retard
Yea
But just to ease ur mind
I aint taking ap calc
Cp remember
rip, can u take ap stats
I can senior year
lol what u gonna do for math
I think ill prob double up stats and calc ab
Next year i take just calculus
Which is super stupid
ooo, i dident know there was a cp class for that
yea, j take the ap test
Well it has all the dumb seniors and stuff
yuk
I could honestly
Self study and take the calc ap
But idk
yea, but time = 0
Exactly
I also gotta study for the stupid entrance exams
wdym
like coolage
Si
are those for like the ones in gb and stuff
Yup
ooooo, i hav a friend on my debate team that goes to cambrage and it is like rly good school
Yea i wanna go
That, oxford or kings college
uk schools good school for math
But to do so i need to pass the entrance exam for mathematics
Which is absolutely cancer
7 questions
15 parts
bruh
i mean at least they dont care about sat
No they do
bruhhhhhh
To even think about applying from the us
To even put an admission
U need a 1480+ and 3 5’s on ap exams
wholy shiiii
i am scared to take the sat cuz like i got a 1330 on the psat and am like, ima fail the sat and go to dum school
Well u could take it again
yea
i dident know u lost points when u got something wrong and you did not gain anything by skipping them
i prob could have done better
Yea
Honestly
U could bubble c
And get a 1100 or something
ha
like i did rly well on the meth section, but for some reason i cant read
*math
Nah its kinda the opposite
Reading i can breeze through
Writing is where i struggle
That is hard
yea, that too
Idk im worried bout aphg
Ugh
Lol look at my new pi
ah yes
what model is that
I wanna get it
so apparently BTSD guest works
but not wastem
they probably changed the password
where's the place you get those files
for numworks
for game thing
u mean where do i get the roms?
yes
off the internet
where
just download em from a non-sketchy website
such as
google nes or gameboy roms
how do I install them
then click the first website
and download it
do I use the numworks external app thing
yea
ok
lemme try hold on
u just add the .nes file to the thing as well as the emulator
itll come up and u can play
ok
python is getting a match statement
ah
only took
30 years
lol
structural pattern matching
does rust do structural pattern matching
this is the video with the todo list
supabase is driving me nuts again
when you sign in
it doesn't actually work
you have to reload the page
but like
you dont tho
its like you cant get user details immediately after signing in
the ad
is
interesting
haha, that is rly good marketing
also Michael finished his rocket engine test stand
so stay tuned for like later this weekend for test burn
sorry it should be roket
I am no savage
i was going to say
thats not michael that said that
bill gates is actually taking over
this is how you do "select * from users"
smh
why
can you understand how it works
sql is hard enough
its some binary thing
yes
i fixed something
currently im debugging my supabase posgresql problems
its like
crashing
in every way
ffmpeg is worse
i have to read a whole github guide
on how to use the C library
have fun
imma finish understanding supabase
database
im making a fully functional app
instead of "select * from users"
why not
this
lol
this part of my policy is broken
you cant
do that
in my database
somehow there is an infinite loop
idk how tho
heck
i have to make the instructions 8 bytes each
you should program microcontrollers
make a database that works over I2C
maybe
I want to do this
though
it would be cool if like
i could plug a microcontroller into a dimm slot
and have it read from the database
over smbus/i2c
im really tired rn
you shouldn't listen to me
i wont
im going to bed in like 2 minutes
im going to bed once this works
which could take a while
this has to be
the dumbest thing ive ever thought of makign
oh god
dealing with numbers is easy
I think
i havent actually checked if this works
dealing with this stupid infinite recursion issue is not
dw
ffmpeg is
worse
this should work
i think
um
ok
it like
gets the first
second
and third byte
of a 4 byte number
does it tho?
idk lol
isnt it >>
let me figure out
HASDLKJHASDFLKAJSHDFLAKSJDHFLASKDJFH
hmm wait
it calles it a "relation"
lol it doesnt work
ah
stupid
little endian
yeah i was gonna ask that next
yep
it's right shift
but the leftmost byte
is 3 away
since the cast to u8
arent most things big endian
reads from the rightmost byte
i think like
tcp/udp is big endian
and x86 and arm and whatever are little
like if i say 100 is 8
that is big endian right
yes
but
it's also
8 in little endian
no 001 would be little endian
no
each byte is preserved as left to right
ah
i see
ok
yeah
so you thought it was cba
but it was abc
well
the example was
0x20801801
which is 4 bytes
so I thought it was taking the 20 as the first thing when casting to a byte
but it takes the 01
it takes the least significant right
wait but then
wait
01 18 80 20
is how it is represented in memory
so i was right
in the wrong way
idfk tbh
this is weird
im too tired to think about this atm
yeah same
it works
so ill leave it alone
i might leave supabase alone as well
sleep or something
lol
imagine
cant relate
lol
uh
how do you make the right shift like
"overflow"
and not
rotate
um
why do you need that
idk
it
20 80 18 01

shift right 1: 20
shift right 2: 80
shift right 3: 20
?
idk cy
ill figure it out
it would be 01 18 80
frankly if i just sleep
and come back tomorrow
shift 0 is last byte
shift 1 is first byte
shift 2 is second byte
shift 3 is FIRST BYTE
my problem will probably just solve itself
what in tarnation
like how does this even make sense
ramesh 💛 binary
not that
the other thing
what other thing
*cygh
my brain is shutting down
there are 13 people in this group chat
i can barely type anymore
so I have amnesia
stop. go to sleep. this can wait.
i need to figure it out tho
im so close
ima go

You can't parse [X]HTML with regex. Because HTML can't be parsed by regex. Regex is not a tool that can be used to correctly parse HTML. As I have answered in HTML-and-regex questions here so many times before, the use of regex will not allow you to consume HTML. Regular expressions are a tool that is insufficiently sophisticated to understand the constructs employed by HTML. HTML is not a regular language and hence cannot be parsed by regular expressions. Regex queries are not equipped to break down HTML into its meaningful parts. so many times but it is not getting to me. Even enhanced irregular regular expressions as used by Perl are not up to the task of parsing HTML. You will never make me crack. HTML is a language of sufficient complexity that it cannot be parsed by regular expressions. Even Jon Skeet cannot parse HTML using regular expressions. Every time you attempt to parse HTML with regular expressions, the unholy child weeps the blood of virgins, and Russian hackers pwn your webapp. Parsing HTML with regex summons tainted souls into the realm of the living. HTML and regex go together like love, marriage, and ritual infanticide. The <center> cannot hold it is too late. The force of regex and HTML together in the same conceptual space will destroy your mind like so much watery putty. If you parse HTML with regex you are giving in to Them and their blasphemous ways which doom us all to inhuman toil for the One whose Name cannot be expressed in the Basic Multilingual Plane, he comes. HTML-plus-regexp will liquify the n​erves of the sentient whilst you observe, your psyche withering in the onslaught of horror. Rege ̔̉x-based HTML parsers are the cancer that is killing StackOverflow it is too late it is too late we cannot be saved the transgression of a chi͡ld ensures regex will consume all living tissue (except for HTML which it cannot, as previously prophesied) dear lord help us how can anyone survive this scourge using regex to parse HTML has doomed humanity to an eternity of dread torture and security holes using regex as a tool to process HTML establishes a breach between this world and the dread realm of c͒ͪo͛ͫrrupt entities (like SGML entities, but more corrupt) a mere glimpse of the world of reg​ex parsers for HTML will ins​tantly transport a programmer's consciousness into a world of ceaseless screaming, he comes, the pestilent slithy regex-infection wil​l devour your HT​ML parser, application and existence for all time like Visual Basic only worse he comes he comes do not fi​ght he com̡e̶s, ̕h̵i​s un̨ho͞ly radiańcé destro҉ying all enli̍̈́̂̈́ghtenment, HTML tags lea͠ki̧n͘g fr̶ǫm ̡yo​͟ur eye͢s̸ ̛l̕ik͏e liq​uid pain, the song of re̸gular exp​ression parsing will exti​nguish the voices of mor​tal man from the sp​here I can see it can you see ̲͚̖͔̙î̩́t̲͎̩̱͔́̋̀ it is beautiful t​he final snuffing of the lie​s of Man ALL IS LOŚ͖̩͇̗̪̏̈́T ALL I​S LOST the pon̷y he comes he c̶̮omes he comes the ich​or permeates all MY FACE MY FACE ᵒh god no NO NOO̼O​O NΘ stop the an​*̶͑̾̾​̅ͫ͏̙̤g͇̫͛͆̾ͫ̑͆l͖͉̗̩̍ͫͥͨ ̟e̠̅s ͎a̧͈͖r̽̾̈́͒͑e n​ot rè̑ͧ̌aͨl̘̝̙̃ͤ͂̾̆ ZA̡͊͠͝LGΌ ISͮ̂҉̯͈͕̹̘̱ TO͇̹̺ͅƝ̴ȳ  TH̘Ë͖́̉ ͠P̯͍̭O̚​N̐Y̡ H̸̡̪̯ͨ͊̽̅̾̎Ȩ̬̩̾͛ͪ̈́̀́͘ ̶̧̨̱̹̭̯ͧ̾ͬC̷̙̲̝͖ͭ̏ͥͮ͟Oͮ͏̮̪̝͍M̲̖͊̒ͪͩͬ̚̚͜Ȇ̴̟̟͙̞ͩ͌͝Sͯ ̨̥̫͎̭̔̀ͅ

Look up the first sentence
prevent inappropriate edits?
can u edit ur post on overflow after its posted?
idk
do you know how to use sql
b'cuz i dont, clearly
yes
but today
I shall be reading the drivers' manual
since I am going to learn how to drive (finally)
lol
i should do that

why do i wanna pay insurance
im making my parents
they keep putting it off
but then my dad was like
idk i dont really wanna teach him to drive
maybe ill put him in the 6 hours
ha, my parents r the opposite, im telling them I dont need to drive I hav no where to go but golf. They say it is a life skill, im like I wanna do it later
then the next thing I know a driving school person is going to show up at my house
lol
im the kid who wants to drive because my brother cant and i want to flex by showing that I can
but my parents keep trying to push it off
lolll
i declare success
i have successfully scraped 68 HTML documents without using regex
i can read
lol
lol
maybe
i should take this class in 12th grade
now i can add functionality to my 4h app
with Supabase
IntrestExpression
did lineageos make things new
yes
lineage official oneplus build
should I do it
imma flahs a custom rom
ok
guys
if you ever
ever make a chat program
make sure to strip location EXIF data
otherwise you can figure out where someone lives
lol i did that once
with someone who sent me something on imessage
imessage does not do that
ah
was it a random person
or like someone you know
really
REALLY
hmm.
thats INTERESTING
a somewhat random person
that i met at a ski resort
lol hmm
i need to try something now
do iphone screenshots have EXIF
let's find out
EXIF geolocation
no iphone images do not have geolocation
lol rust
shut up
lol
this is a built in data type
tbh this is probably wrong lol
more awfulness
an insert
so
is
cy i have made the most efficient db
freeze
cdknight: Geler
freeze
cdknight: congelar
Imagine Cy's bot actually working
lol
cdknight: ㅋㅋ
correct

I should stop standing next to people all the time
and do this ^^ instead
ok...
have you
used jekyll
lol use ur ipod
no currently im looking for my app's logo
i lost it somewhere
when i was moving to mac
you should stay on mak
I integrated supabase into my app
that is
very supa
GDNDFKJASHFDLKSJD MARGINS
MARGINS ARE A THING
the margin is there im sure
it just like
didnt show it
the switch theme button gets scared when its on safari
and tries to cuddle in closer
with the other buttons
i swear i dont think this is even an issue in IE
"Sorry, iOS is not supported. For a better experience, please purchase an Android phone."
ramesh
stop dreaming
wake up
nope
not going to
i have to get my backup keys so I don't lock myself out of all my acocunts when I flash a custom rom today
this is painful
oh right
you have all the totp stuff
yeah
set up on the phone
have fun
it would be a problem
maybe I should get an RSA SecurID or something not on my phone
like a separate 2fa device
maybe
or maybe i stop using 2fa
my watch has this app called Authenticator Pro
which can do local totp
*had this app
before i deleted it
when it stopped working for some reason
hm
ill see
fish lets you add to the path without any issue
like
that is so convenient
im installing homebrew on my mac
ur hac
yes
Hac Pro
my mac pro
with 128 dimm slots
lol
I should install ESXi on my mac mini
so I can make more macs
or maybe I should just try and make esxi_unlock work
and then
run imessage on my "mac"
lol hac
someone is going to hackintosh the rpi soon
how do you even fix that
i doubt it
you have to use the smc configurator
that would be pretty hard
telegram is being laggy on mac
the next 4h meeting may be dedicated to dealing with safari
lol
mac version or qt version
idk lemme send a screenshot
oh thats nice
it like
thats the mak version
yeah it does that
puts the screenshot on a white background
not really
KDE does it though
I'm pretty sure
deleted for privacy reasons
see rounded corners are nice
but they are so annoying
from a development standpoint
"there are 13 people here"
I used to have them on bspwm
like
it was the WM doing the rounding
so it could probably truncate some of the content possibly
windows might get rounded corners
but im not sure if i want rounded corners
no i think i do want rounded corners
i want rounded cyners as well
lol
I should make a program called cyify
Cynvert a sentence to a cytence
please do
write it in python
then i can add it to my bot
cyfinfaza: yna gallaf ei ychwanegu at fy bot
lol
that's like
welsh
it should be
cyfinfaza: Rameshmraeg
bad
bad
bad
bad
lol
imma make cyify
sɛ

those are the ones for now
I did the formulz
for deb8
cy
it is REALLY bad
but like
it seems to work
i improved it
btw you need a program called lex_lookup
if you want to use this
hi im netlify
i dont like working
how do I make them all the same height when I highlight
Um
Send me the html
I can't do anything rn
But once I'm back at my computer
ok
nw
ok I can now look at it
it seems to now be mostly fixed
lol
ok how to
i was doing stuff
?
this
idk it doesn't look that broken for me
it looks mostly fine
I thought you had already fixed it
I didn't
give a second
right
im learning about mapbox
this is clearly a firefox problem
lol
lol
im confused as to what you want from me
do you want me to do anything
no
i will have to figure this out
i mean if you wanna test it in firefox
and fix it for me/figure out why it happens
you can
but like
i would like to make cy2 screenshare work
yeah
then maybe we can discuss
then
do not bother this
ok if you have any specific questions
ask me
although css is more like cs-mess
so like
idk
New idea for a css
Cys
bad
you should
add the cyifier i made
i could do that
but im working on cy2 screenshare rn
i need it to work at school
so i need to move it to port 443
dude, I made it to the qf of the ncfls and idk how
all these ppl are jrs and seniors
Oh damn nice
Is it by urself or team?
team, but congress is by myself
cuz like we rf as a team, but we like compete alone
Thats pretty nice
that's realy good
thank
Gl on the qf
Ull do fine
yeah
same as akhil
gl michael
thank
go speed like GME
much thank
hahahahah
To the moooooooon
yeet to the top
🚀
bruhh, doge is like going to the center of the earth
rokt
Oh for sure
A crypto based on Elons tweets
hahahah
best finance
Thats def gonna make some bank
no complex thing
j elon tweets
Nothing at all
do an NFT and sell an elon tweet
ahhahaha
YES
No honestly
elon could triple his net worth off of tween nfts
also I gtg
cuz deb8
Those go for a lot
Ah cya
Gl
yep
gl
or export the recovery codes…
i found it
that was problematic
i set a serif font on my phone
and it is actually not that bad
the quality
of this menu
1200% i say
who is this dominic person
someone who used to be in our club
idk if they still are
also idk why my site is broakin
cisco
Those r so cool
Rack mounted anything becomes cool
Ah i miss my servers now
this
in 8th grade
since i actually have no idea
this is a worthless piece of trash
that sounds like a jet engine
That router?
How
Is that even possible
My servers are quieter than that
it is a router
perfect
this is exactly what the router has
I should try and install MIPS linux on this
since I think this router is a MIPS CPU
Also if anyone here wants a pi case I can print one for you
i could do that
when i have time
my ipod touch is disassembling itself
which is weird for an apple product
the battery wants out
i should probably be more concerned about slicing my finger on the fan than the pi dying
lol slicing your finger on a 12v fan running on 5v
you should see
what i did with a fan
first let me get my pi 3
lets just say
the way it ended
2 blades broke off the fan
upon impact
with my thumb
what about your thumb
it was
ugly
to say the least
that
i do not want to imagine plus
okay where did my pi go
cy
yes
ok
do you know what the blue one is for
The blue wire is the PWM signal wire. Without it the fan should stay at full speed all the time. If you repair it you should regain the ability to control the fan speed, if you choose to.Jun 15, 2012
this was meant to be in response to the cy but it also applies to the proceeding message
hmm
okay
if you run it at 5v
it will be slow
and quiet
ok
let me try first
i need an actual power supply tho
cy is using mapbox
mapbox is nice
its based on webgl
but its like
actually good
where am i going to get the power supply
yeah I've heard about it
it used to be open source too
would you like me to test something for you
i can test the continuity on the pi4
between the usb port
and the power lines
sure
if i find full continuity
my sureness it will not fry moves to 95%
i just have to find my pi 4
its like
somewhere
over the rainbow
i mean im using a 3b+ rn
oh
since i care less about this one
i just want to see if we get fan spin
idk just try it
um
fanspin
i dont really have a micro usb power supply
chooch
louis rossmann
ima keep theming
and working with mapbox
ok
imma find a psu
have fun
i might just use the oneplus
even tho it's not enough
lol fan spin
imma extract all the fans from the mips router
oh I might also have a 5v fan
I'm retrying the pi benchmarks with a fan
I overclocked it
it's like 600 points more
That’s pretty good
P2966 second run
great way to benchmark I know
3rd run: P2967
cy is learning go
oh good luck with that
i hated it
cause it only compiles if u use all the variables
u cant leave unused ones
idrc
see
the thing is
i wanna write an api
that works on vercel
and i dont wanna use nodejs
and i wanna know a compiled language
and python and vercel are having relationship issues
is the bane of my existence
vercel is like
no
no
you will not
no
;alskdfj;alskdfj;alskdfj
so im like
time to learn go
cuz both netlify and vercel support it so
Go is bad
because
someone told me go is bad
um mongodb drivers in go
are um
complicated
*yawn
i just need to get vercel to stop giving me stupid errors
because it still runs on python 3.6
like its the stone ages or something
hmm
so
codetools-api
which works
has a requirements.txt
with version numbers in it
what if
i just grab all those known working versions
and put them in the requirements.txt for this one
a lot of them are like
completely new
like
codetools-api uses Flask 1.1
whereas web-analytics which uses 2.0
hmm
its ok Vercel. ill follow you back to the stone ages
why is this not a thing
/etc/fstab

normal people:

etc fs tab
filesystem tab
fs tab

me: 

etc f STAB

STAB THE F
TianoCore for ARM
ok conclusion
if you want to virtualize on a raspberry pi
dont use esxi
it's that simple
the performance is trash
like
my unoverclocked pi on kvm
performs better
than my MAX overclocked esxi pi
stonks
we went from this
to 1000 points more
Bruhh
wait
thats really cheap tf
i want this one
Yeee
Prusa mini best
Also resin printers rly gud
yea
Like if ur gonna get a printer that rize
Size
Get sla
btw michael
i bought my pi
and
it works
but u need some other things to properly handle it
in school
Sick
Do u hav cable this time
like i got it to connect and everything so I can actually show it off
i dont need one
it uses ethernet
Ooooo
i brought an ethernet cable to school
and i connect it to my laptop
I mean properly
i j put the parts i print out in the su
sun
and it work
*yawn
3.2 million results and this is what you put at the top
ooo
hahahah
I act introduced leg in congressional deb8 for right to repair
it was a rly good deb8
okay
what is that from
ooh I'm working on a 3d map
interesting
Guess not
cuz i was gonna join but ok
next week i guess?
do you wanna talk about react
Yeah
wait what is the yeah for
For talking about react
oh ok
you can call me on discord
or should i call you
That’s one decimal place bud
wait
3.07
im dumb
And 10.93
I am like kindergarden dumb
much thanks
Np
mapbox is driving me nuts
its driving me nuts
more than supabase

um the raspberry pi kernel is faster than the mainline kernel I think
?
rpi linux kernel
is a modified linux kernel
with raspberry pi patches
mainline kernel is the stock vanilla kernel
i see
blog
cy you should honestly make a blog
I think there are a lot of things you could write about
And you can do it in Gatsby or something and contentful or whatever
but like I think it would actually be a good idea
Ooo wait whats thor?
yeah
Jekyll seems way easier to make a post
Just make a new .md file
same in mine
but this is like
it automates the front matter
Oh wait
Thats cool
also it looks cool
fancy create thing
Yea
Im trying to see the difference between default and home/page/post on Jekyll
Im assuming i things that i normally would put in the head of a website in default
gfmndfsdfsdfsdf mapbox
i literrelarely wanna make ti tbe orange when you click it
ajsfdoif aelrkj now3 ohhard is it
cpu storage ram gpu
yeah
that's what will be benchmarked
im gonna actually benchmark it
Cy n'a pas aucun idée qu'est-ce que j'essaye de dire ici
cdknight: Ramesh have no idea what am I trying to say here
Сy n'a pas aucun idée qu'est-ce que j'essaye de dire ici

C­y n'a pas aucun idée qu'est-ce que j'essaye de dire ici
cdknight: Ramesh has no idea what am I trying to say here

?
i got the thing to not replace cy with ramesh
Ah right
mais maintenant ce ne fonctionne pas
cdknight: but now does not work
ah

when you zoom out too far from the 4-H fair
lol so I didn't forget chem I just forgot this
nvm
smh
U still need help
Also me and akhil had that test last week lol
lol
I got the vaccine and everything and I am not an anti vaxer, but im listening to this and I am thinking
is there a transcript
sadly no
i am transcribing it now
with cool transcribe software
conjugate acid is essentially a base
aka add a H+
oooo
the same can be said for the opposite
conjugate base is an acid
so remove a H+
ok
thank you
np
i thought u needed to do stuff with the rxn
nope
and i was like bruhh
this one is super super super ez
ye
i was like, is tong pullin one on us
but he was nice for this
so wait for the ones without a h
like this
do u do nothing
well
thats for the conjugate acid right?
u add one
so it becomes HNO_2
oooo
much thx
np
hi
could someone
before this period ends
lol
actually I could test this next period as well
what i put here to get my contentful data displayed
this time there are no errors
what is appearing
firstpost, bodyofpost, time, images
send screenshot
i did
no of what appears
on the page
ok
j the first page thing
so it says test1
is test1 the content of firstPost in contentful?
ye
ok so basically
what you wanna do is like
also i update thing
to this
and so on
with all the things you need
oooo
ok
thank u
ur welcome
much thanks
yeah but now replace the first P with an H1
and make the date be under it
rather than below the content
also
you should use ReactMarkdown
which allows you to write your posts in markdown
in contentful
and have them appear nice in your website
you can look at the 4H app for reference
on the first page
it pulls content from contentful (although in a different way than this) and then it puts it in ReactMarkdown to make it appear nice
with headings and images and all that
ok
should i install this
im debating on it
it allows u to sideload apps essentially
and itll sign apps and everything
huh
you should try it
i want to
but
it uses a mac as a server
which idk about
idk
amc
is the next gme
according to reddit frontpage
*blinks
man
i should have invested in it
wish i coudl
do that
u prob could
na
im not allowed
but that stuff i usually stay away
its way to volatile to predict anything
honestly tho
if u just go on r/wallstreetbets
and do whatever they do
it's for people with extra cash who dont know what to do with it
u could prob make some money
so it doesnt matter
yeah
i might try it in college if i have money
honestly netlify looked better in serif
correction
Everything looks better in serif
nah
most things look better in sans
but
netlify
if u use a subtle serif things look nice
they had a really nice serif
yea it was nice
sans imo is hard to get right
imo its the other way around
really?
this was way better
yeah
cy might make a blog
in gatsby
i might as well
in jekyll
or gatsby
i wanna host it on netlify
idk i think jekyll is prob nicer
cuz like
netlify probably is better for gatsby
yea thats nice
Vercel is good for next
but
im prob gonna do github pages
if that even works
im not used to limits
vercel has no limits
well
they have 2 limits
no more than 1 team member
so no teams
and no more than 100 builds per day
other than that
oh and
no more than one project with server-side analytics enabled
but other than that
unlimited transfer
unlimited api calls
ooo
i finally got this dang thing to work
it was so simple
svg's
yes
are amazing
they can do everything u want
and you can style them with css
and animate them with css
i mean now i cant put text for some reason but thats probably a css issue
yea
which is perfect
^^theme changing svgs
apcs final?
yes
with matt
thats pretty cool
im thinking of how i wanna set up my blog
oh i already did
its a matter of
can i do it
You Can Do It
cause its kinda a bit mabye a lot ambitious
how ambitious
very ambitious in my book
well
what is ambitious about it
actually thats prob cause idk much bout html/css/js
if i did its prob not that hard whatsoever
what specifically do you think will be hard
cuz i can tell you
if it will be
honestly its prob going to be how im going to get jekyll front matter to show up on the website
that or animation
what is jekyll
and frontmatter
static thing like gatsby
meant for blogs
but you can do that with Gatsby too
yea u can
its
also what is "frontmatter"
its like a thing u add at the top of stuff
like author title time
but it can be other stuff
if i get annoyed using this ill probably use gatsby
ah ok
ok i get it
but not jekyll
its like
ruby Gatsby?
i think
i looked it up on reddit
does it use React
this was one of the things people recommended
dont think so
its html
so you write it in vanilla
well
u can write it in markdown files as well i believe
well no i mean like
but ive been writing it in vanilla
the code
yea like <body> whatever
ik the actual posts are md
tbh that's probably fine for a blog site
with not much interactive content
yea
but idk
i shall see
ok
if i make a blog
imma make it with Gatsby
yea
im good at Gatsby now
cause u used it alot
yes
i like reacts animation stuff
react spring is such a nice library
lol yes
i have not used it
but i saw it
tbh i dont wanna make a blog blog
i wanna make like
a multimedia blog
cuz i dont have time to write
yea im gonna host my github stuff there as well
the problem with a multimedia blog with videos and stuff is that like
storage
and
hosting
server
but afaik GitHub has no limits
and neither does vercel
yea
i believe u can use github pages with jekyll
which is also kinda why i wanna use it
yeah
well
can you use Gatsby?
i wanna see hold on
ok so you can
but you cant
you cant do the fancy build in the cloud thing
but you can just build locally and push the build to GitHub pages
interesting
vercel builds in the cloud
so you dont manage anything
correction cy
everything looks better in serif
AGAINNNNN
Yea i think it’s gonna fall down tho
Isnt amc recalling its shares back to recount?
this funny
Lol does "The Babylon Bee" have a video about the capitol riot *cough actual domestic terrorism
lol
what has my French class come to

*yawn
google translate calls this "English"
firefox
lol
engrish
time to do more french
lol I never get Italian hw

je quand
ye
I fucked up that last test too
yea
well to go to ap physics
i think its a B-
not to pass the class
yea
ap physics > chemistry
i did far better in physics
since it was more
useful
and fun
Ramesh meeing far better = A+ > A
no
A- to A
but
nah it joke
that was because of idsatnce learning
otherwise id have gotten a B+ in chem
or prob worse
ooooo
i am getting 2 contentful posts where i hav them being orderd by type, but not like that post they are
so how would i get like the post order that I want
this is kode now
yes
no
wait
Ramesh is compiling
and has thrown an exception
you need to install a new dependency of ramesh
npm install Ramesh-doz-react
if Michael were to code a cow
it works
that
is freaky
true
also I believe gravity is being ignored
we haven't done npm install gravity
haha
idt we should do that tho
nope
its like when teachers tell u to assume no friction
fax
just have no gravity
and no drag
ha, coefficents are 0
g = 0
fs = 0
everything is now 0
f_k = 0
yes
F = 0
I = 0
current is zero
your computer should shut down
noooo
Ha i have a latop
check mate
it is being powerd by the clicks of my keys
wait
is that possible
no
but now it is
bruhh
like how turning a motor generates a bit of electricity
my battery is scuffed
it went from 20% to 3%
and j said it ls low batt
u should prob get that checked
mac wac is the same but only when it uses its gpu
at least i can replace my batt
== pause
Photoshop?
Ah
The pause button
They really need to fix their website
yeah but somehow like
it became that
wins
but ugly
so I need color iedas
honestly
i forget the website
it has some really really nice color ideas
im using that one
but they have some really nice ones
and this one as well
they have really nice blue themes
oooooo
much thanks akhil
np
I like the background, but what about the header
hmm
an orange mabye?
ima try

what about like a gold
gold is a bit too yellow
hmm wait
for ur header
i like those two colors together
they comeout nice
ok
i gtg for English discussion
ah have fun
make the font white
that will automatically make it look good

DM Serif is a thing
alongside DM Sans
and DM Mono
Yea i like the look of it
you know what imma do for my blog
imma let the user choose
whether they like sans or serif
shadow or no
blue or white or black
your blog is completely dysfunctional on mobile
you should fix that
my goal for my blog design is for it to work in all browsers
from IE to firefox mobile
IE is dropping support in a few years aint it?
its a challenge
but yeah
something like that
yea next year
i still have it
on my pc
i like to destroy websites
with it
gimme a website
i can destroy it for you
imma use a flexbox
nice
idk how imma go about making mine
i has a design
a design
im making something basic for now
kinda like rameshs
but it works on mobile
ive just been slowly making it in vanilla
and ill adapt it later
yeah that's what im doing
im making it in vanilla first
that way its way easier to fix and learn what to do
yes
GitHub lol
github turned into a giant egg
ok this actually looks pretty nice
font-wise
This is why
U use serif
What font is that?
DM Serif Text
Looks nice
ikr
I still like libre Baskerville
But thats a close second
nah
dm serif is better
Yea in that scenario dm looks better
ill leave it as an option
in my settings
Yea u can leave it
I am realizing
That i need to add a post number
To give each post a unique id
why dont 1*10^-14 work
hmm
uh
so
ur sig figs r wrong
remember
yeah smh michal
before decimal place doesnt matter
its after
bruhbruhbruhbruhbruhbruhbruhbruhbruhbruhbruhbruhbruhbruhbruhbruhbruhbruh
cause the 11 is decided by the exponent
yea
so u need 11.whatever the 2 digits here
wh
so then 11.08
3 sigfigs?
yea
isnt that 4 tho
im confused akiru help
before decimal place doesnt matter
no
i know
ye, but tong man says before decimal place
?
11.1 is 3 sf
2.78 or wotever is also
3sf
try 11.08
if that doesnt work
ye, but he says bc of like doing the calculations with scientific notation u gotta hav the digits after the dp
ill pull up mine and try like 11.0whatever two go here and stuff
yea
much thx akhil
did it work?
i ran out of tries
this is bcuz akhil is a geniuz
how do i
fax
misspel
wait imma try it
yea 11.08 is correct
much thx akhil
np

but now he remembers
ooo

how was school
lol that's my animation
ik
he copied my post module
i stole it from cy
i see

It sounds stupid
But i think its 3
2.37 has 3 sig figs

wait
3 after dp
Thats two michael
Yup
i am smrt
much thx akhil
It work?
ye
Nice
I want this
But not this
I want like a disk off of one
this is a starting point
for my blog
style-wise
i do however have to figure out how i want the header to stick to the page
i can make it stick
but it looks really ugly rn cuz its so big
also i need some media queries
so it doesn't look weird on mobile
you have to agree
this looks pretty good
ie be like
Yea it looks good
ok
oooooo
I like the menu transisions
ikr
are you *content-ful* with your posts
not yet
there are no posts yet
its just like
generic content
r u using contentful
no im not even using Gatsby yet
bruhh
im just making a proof of concept
for my style
ok
my next step is to make a Gatsby site
and figure out the logistics of that
lol tasmota commit suicide
now i have to reconfigure everything
or my lights will not turn back on
why is this wrong
i did work
idt u convert to mols when finding the conc
so you would hav 1.5/1,1
1.1
also for x when I calculated with ur numbers on the bottem I got 7.524e-5
wait nvm
for that calc
yes, let's just print 6 trillion dollars twitter
What
I wanna try this now
Concentration is molarity
And molarity is moles/liters
Its cause ur doing small number approximation
When ur kc value is nowhere even close to a proper value to approximate
The rule of thumb is 10^-4 and smaller
it prob doesn't do anything
no I think it can recognize key presses
and make blinky lights
and it might even be able to control the screen
you should try it
if you need an stlink i have one
but i don't think you need an stlink
yea its just a normal flash
but i dont have the things to flash it rn
especially the most important part
the calculator
lol
where is your calculator
in a box
in a storage facility
why
because all my stuff is in a storage facility
are you moving or something?
yea
where are you moving to
and why on earth would you put your calculator in storage
im staying in the hills
its like
everything in my room was put into storage
you should have grabbed your calculator so you could use it on chem and math
but ok
and to flash sketchy rust code onto it
I need ideas for slam poetry
write a slam poem
about slamming people
*blink
i am not content with this error
idk i am not graphql master

interesting
minecraft on the browser
i think that is three.js
i have a micro b cable
imma try that numworks thing
lol nvm
wait i can use wsl
but
I'm not interested in attempting to install the entire arm embedded toolchain in 3 minutes on school wifi
so maybe this is a later thing

the other cursed thing
is a windows computer and a my passport for mac
stylz

although tbh idrc its 4h anyway
oh god I was so worried for a moment
i had a fidget spinner attached to my drone
and i was trying to lift it
and then it crashes
and i smell burn
and when i unplug and replug
only one ESC actually boots up
but then i let it cool for a moment
yea, I am, I am going to change the post module completely
and they all still boot
and work
hahahah
i can tell you one thing
im not doing that again
is this the mini fpv drone
yes
how u fit a figit spinenr
it did manage to lift the fidget spinner for a hot second
i attached it with a cable loop
i hung it off the bottom
o
i dum
i tried to fly it with keys hanging off the bottom
which worked fine
an analogy would be like
trying to drive a water bottle
it was so weird
it was like really stable
then it flew to the right
then it was really stable
then it flew to the left
epic imbed fail
one sec

sad
ramesh va acheter une pinecil
c'est un fer à souder qu'a un cpu risc-v
idk french
im buying a pinecil
it's a soldering iron that has a riscv cpu
why the hell does a soldering iron need a cpu
to be smart
fancy
a soldering iron needs to become hot
and as everyone knows
you dont need to be smart to be hot
wait i thought it was gonna be like 50$ or so
its only 25$
yep
wait
its a pine thing
it's really good
yes
ironOS
...
StoneOS
WAIT
iOS
im also buying a
IT RUNS
oh no
iOS
stand
yea
thats a given
does the stand also run ios
and a cable
so 30 buckos
oo this looks cool
pine64 is really cool
ik
i might buy a pine sbc while im at it
are they like open source everything
i can buy a pinecube
30 bucks
for a camera
are they
it is sealed
so if you brick it
the unselaed one
you have to like
break it
believe so
ok so
imma buy 120 dollars of pine stuff
pinecil
pinetime
and pinecube
i have an amazon soldering iron
you plug it into the wall
and it heats up
no
and you turn a knob
i want this
cuz it's cheap
a physical knob
and shrey told me to get it which means it's good
and it changes the temperature
lol
ironOS
how much did ur iron cost cy
also
how the hell is the 120W psu so cheap
...
lol
i need to update my website
im going to make a bookmarklet collection
calum made
a bookmarket
that does
the most beautiful thing
to websites
lol
i literally could have been hosting playtools completely free this whole time
now i can free up my vultr
i bought a pinecil with iOS
lol css
wdym
you mean
yes
how could one think that...
to custom domains
see what i dont get is like
how do they make money
sell ur data duh
idk
inherently, my data is already public
...if they have it
yes
i was just
going to say
I mean paid model
They probably have a paid model
And then commercial pricing
Oh god
Wood blocks
Interesting choice
click clickclick click
Interesting
Lucas and Cy
i mildly remember lucas
they deleted my blackrocket project
lol banana phone
no
bannanas
I added a file
im trying to think about how to make an immutable system
i was thinking 
partitions A B C D E
A & B are system partitions with software
C is the "springboard" partition
D is the bootloader partition
E is the data partition
C might be gotten rid of idk
I mean do u need a springboard?
Im assuming the springboard manages A & B
My computer crashed
Nice
Don't use Wayland kids
Yes
U would need a rly smart bootloader
so basically
D boots C
then C checks to launch A or B
Yea
hmm
wait
no you dont need a C
you just need to modify the bootloader
If its only A & B yea i dont think u need C
.
and basically if A/B boots successfully you
set a flag on the bootloader
to not boot into the other one
and then it stays like that
until the updater runs
then it tells the bootloader to choose the other one (but like provisional)
That works
then the bootloader checks if it's provisional and if the provisional flag doesn't get removed
it means that something screwed up
then when the system reboots it will delete the provisional flag and then boot into the original system
i think
thats kinda like how android works
Is it?
yep
Ik springboard is a apple thing
yeah ik too
i just call it that here
Didnt know android had something like it
since that term makes sense
Yea
no it's unrelated
thats ur app springboard
this is an "OS springboard"
But its function
the names arent related in anyway just the name is the same
Yea i figure
also you could do an ostree setup as an alternative
or snapshot
so btrfs for example has snapshots
and you'd snapshot, update, then if the update fails, rollback the snapshot
ostree is like git for filesystems
so if it screws up, you just roll back
hmm
can I add one
^^
lol
thats my testimonial
testimonials are words
not pictures
a picture is a thousand words
so that is 1000 words
you cannot cast a picture to words
a car weighs as much as 1000 cobs of corn
but i cannot eat it
well
u could
if ur determined
*safely eat it
there u go
imma ask my various teachers for testimonials
and some of my friends
who received help on condition that they would give me testimonials
is down
tf
it is an acid if it accepts a pair
it is a base because it needs a pair
Lewis things are backwards I think
Tbh not too sure, I want to ask Pernia today
I believe lewis is the same as your conjugate whatever
A conjugate acid is the base once it recieved an electron and vice versa
A normal base accepts, acids give
A lewis acid accepts an electron pair
A lewis base needs an electron pair
according to the webassign
yea cause its the opposite
conjugate acid is a base pretty much
no no no
are supposedly the same thing
yea thats the same thing
wait what?
read the WebAssign question
ah this is lewis
not lowry
yea ammonia would be a lewis base
because it has a lone pair of electrons
that can be donated to the acid
smrt
I thought it dissociated into 1
h3po4
i tried 3, but i get 8.00*10^-4
and it dont work
it should be 3
ah wait
r u using the formula?
ye
it should be 3(40ml)(0.100M)=1(x)(150mL)
yea, i j caught that, i j cant count sig figs lol
not sig figs
count sci notation
ah yea
i duum
sorry for waste time
much thanks for help
nah ur good
im chilling
what does he mean by 0.25 ml
like find the conc
through molarity
Uh i think that should be M
but when i do the math i get 225 and it says that b wrong
Thats weird
U might have a sig fig issue on ur hands
bruhh
But i would also email him to see if thats intentional
ok, thank you akhil
Np
i emailed him and he said it is for m
now the question is why is it not 225 or 230
bc sig figs say 230
cuz 450 ml is 2
and h2so4 is 2
fuck
wait
im dumb
my answer is in ml and it is asking for l
nice one
man
its so surpring
that its already another wwdc
feels like it was a few months ago
ik right
so far
not bad
i like the stuff
ye

To begin to look at the impacts of censorship by social media monopolies, we look towards the actions of the United States in combating their reign of censorship. When the bill of rights was ratified in 1789, the United States took a path of freedom for all of its citizens. Taking back the reins of government, people were thought to never have their liberties threatened. However, fast forward to the 21st century and the size of the federal government had grown, but was not as big as tech corporations that dominated the social and economic landscapes of the world. Due to their monopolistic status, large tech companies had the keys to the internet, and with it, the keys to global free speech. In 2008, as large tech monopolies were growing along with their potential for control of major socioeconomic landscapes, the US government sought not to lift a finger. This is contributed to the financial crisis that preceded the era as Congress wanted to pass legislation to aid the economy and contribute to the creation of jobs, instead of the regulation of corporations, which inhibited the creation of jobs (Cato Institute). Thus, after the initial recovery after the financial crisis of 2008, the US government started to crack down on the actions of big tech, and the scope in which their power was portrayed throughout the world. This was instated with several key investigative committees put in place in the mid 2010s and a revised mandate towards the FCC outlining steps to take to regulate online media outlets (CNBC). These steps taken by the federal government, were the first official regulatory bodies for media platform moderation. As time progressed, the scope of online social media outlets expanded, and so did their policies for moderation. Under Section 230, a piece of legislation that gave social media companies the power to remove elicit content form their sites, media platforms started to remove content that they deemed objectively hateful (Teh). In this move, tech companies started to censor content that was objectively out of the scope of Section 230, as elicit content was made subjective to the media platform. Thus, in 2017, a judicial committee under the branch of the Department of Justice, launched an investigation into the constitutionality of Section 230, and to eventually bring it to the bench of the Supreme Court (Zenial). However, due to the sweeping protections outlined under Section 230, Congress is powerless in passing the legislation that would nullify the law as that would mean an overreach of legislative powers. As the US government is in gridlock, and as the cracks in the Republic start to widen, large tech companies are making swift action to exercise their grip on the world, and push the agenda that best suits their woke ideals. American citizens, once free to express their opinion without social and economic ramification, are now subject to the same dystopian legislature pushed in facist regimes. The so-called ‘freedom of speech’ guaranteed by the founding fathers that gave American’s the right to express themselves freely is not allowed to be exercised. The only thing that is allowed to be expressed on the platforms these large tech companies control is the one sided agenda, that has so far, been only from the Democratic Party (Pew Research Center). During the Pandemic, these problems have only been exacerbated, and the Triopoly of Facebook, Twitter and Google, prevented the free expression of American’s in their darkest hour. These outlets were the only accessible public communication medium for everyday citizens and only tightened their grip on the everyday lives of American Citizens. In all, the very government of the United States, that was created to protect the rights of the people it serves, has failed in protecting American’s Right to free speech through its lackluster control of monopolistic tech corporations.
hisore
it bad grammer and stuff bc rough draft
but it is only the first paragraph
ur capitalization
and the us is not 100% free speech
Yuh it b 1123
Ye I saw that, I should add

But I wanna sleep so I am
yeah that kinda thing but also u cant like
try to put pplz in danger
i think
Ye
or like
cause harm
so u cant say lets overthrow the government while actually meaning it
to like ppl who will probably do it
No, u can
since thats clear and present danger
But it can b used agenst u in court
u can say lets overthrow the government
If the act is carried out
but like if u have a bunch of armed ppl who want to assassinate the president
and like r ready to do so
and then you say it
then i think u cant do that
Yea that is different
Cuz they hav cause of intent
Besides what they say
yeah
that sounds right
But Facebook saying trump bad and ban for 2 years is censorship
i should like to read about the reasoning
I don't specifically agree but I can see why
and there are some pretty good arguments you could make
"3 tbsp unsalted butter, room temperature"", ""4 tsp Framboise or brandy"", ""12 oz Plums, ripe red-skinned, pitted, cut into 3/4-inch-thick wedges"", ""1/4 cup red currant jelly"", ""Whipped Cream (optional)""","""4 1/2-pint baskets fresh blueberries"", ""1/2 cup sugar""
r"", ""3 large eggs"", ""1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice"", ""1 teaspoon vanilla extract"", ""1/2 teaspoon almond extract"", ""1/3 cup strawberry or currant jelly"", ""3 1-pint baskets fresh strawberries, hulled, halved lengthwise""","""1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract"", ""Topping"", ""2/3 cup sugar"", ""1/2 teaspoon salt"", ""1/2 teaspoon baking soda"", ""1/4 cup red currant jelly"", ""8 large ripe red or purple plums, (about 1 1/2 pounds) Cake"", ""1/4 teaspoon almond extract"", ""2 tablespoons canola oil"", ""1/3 cup water"", ""1 1/4 cups unsifted cake flour"", ""1 large large egg white"", ""1/4 cup almond paste"", ""3/4 cup sugar"", ""1 teaspoon baking powder"", ""1 large egg"", ""2/3 cup buttermilk""","""1 2/3 cups unbleached all-purpose flour"", ""1/3 cup blanched, sliced almonds"", ""2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder"", ""1/2 teaspoon sea salt"", ""1 tablespoon organic sugar"", ""5 tablespoons unsalted butter – at room temperature"", ""2 extra large eggs – beaten, 1 tablespoon reserved for brushing the tops of the scones"", ""1/3 cup heavy cream"", ""1/4 teaspoon pure almond extract"", ""1/4 cup blanched, sliced almonds as garnish"", ""2 teaspoons organic sugar as garnish"", ""3/4 cup crème fraîche"", ""3/4 cup strawberry jam with balsamic"", ""Extra flour to roll the dough"", ""2 1/2” round cookie cutter"", ""1 large jelly roll pan – buttered or lined with a silpat""","""Yield: 16 2-inch doughnuts"", ""Prep time: 1 hour 45 minutes"", ""Cook time: 10 minutes"", ""2 1/2 teaspoons (1 7-gram or 1/4-ounce packet) active dry yeast"", ""1/4 cup (50 grams) granulated sugar"", ""3/4 cup (180 ml) lukewarm (not hot) milk"", ""2 large egg yolks"", ""Few gratings of orange or lemon zest, 1 teaspoon vanilla or 1/2 teaspoon almond extract"", ""2 tablespoons (1 ounce or 30 grams) butter softened"", ""2 1/3 cups (290 grams
good argument
yeah
2 large egg yolks
this is why banning trump is not censorship
ha
almond extract butter softened baking powder, michael
get owned
noooooooooooooo
i win
i always win
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
i stand next to people that always win all the time
cy meme
hahahaha
standing next to people all the time
I question where he got that from
lol
imo facebook can do whatever the hell they want, its a free market; regardless of whether or not its a bad thing, it doesn't break the law
cuz there is no law saying I have to spread your messages
and last i checked
facebook is not congress
at least i hope not
agreed
i tend to forget that argument but yes
you probably would legally sink in a court battle since they aren't the government
They cant if they are a monopoly \
the government sets standerds for monopolys to uphold basic constutional libertys
and free speech is one of them
I know I need a strong acid and week conjaguate base
Yup
but most of them hav strong acids
Yea isnt it strong acid weak conjugate base
ye
Or weak base strong conjugate acids
wait it is week acid and strong base
but how u kno what is weak base
If its not in the list
o lol
How many questions does the practice have?
Fridays test is gonna be so annoying
22
yea
it is
Oh god
but like practice tests r ushally longer
Still tho
also I found cool chart from dr pernia website
19/20ish questions is going to be a time crunch
Oooo yes
Thats nice chart
yea it is going to suck
I need gud grade on dis test cuz I dident do so well on the last one
I just need to not fail
erwin chargoff
confusion 9000
Its starts low
So its strong base to a weak acid
U have the right idea the wording is a bit different
why wouldent the curve b inverted
It starts below ph 7
So that means it is a acid
they bolth start below ph 7
This starts at 14
hmmm
Look how he mentions it
Strong base - weak acid
O
OOOO
So the solution has a strong base
OOOOOO
i am dumb
So its ph is 14
Yes very
bruhh this test is not lookin so hot
It is not
bruhh
lol the french students made a group chat
and chose to exclude me
because i don't have imessage
ah yes
because i don't have access to their inferior messaging platform
well it may be inferior
but its one of the most popular
its a corporate scheme
i don't like corporate schemes to coax the public
it works
it may be a scheme but apple’s got a way
of marketing it
look once they make their messaging app cross-platform
then maybe ill consider it
facetime because cross-platform kinda
imessage probably wont
lol u make it all turn green
facetime is not really cross platform
you can start a facetime call on an iphone
and then share a link
yea ik
i tried it out
its more inclusive then it ever has before
Lol I guess
Just use Google Duo
It's like
Actually good
My grandparents use it with us on ADSL half way across the world
And it works flawlessly
it could be
i dont use video-calling apps
I don't use them much
But my mom uses duo
For my grandparents
So ik about it
to be fair u need good internet regardless
on both sides for it to work well
Akhil
ADSL
Max 2mbps
im speaking from experience
i can never videocall my grandparents in india
idk for us it works really well
im not sure what they get
no like the latency was so good that like
we were on a call
the power went out
and we saw the lights go out in their apartment
like
interesting
the power went out
the lights went out
then
the wifi router still had a little juice left in the psu
which was enough for duo to transfer a video of the lights being out
thats really good
i havent tested any enough to make a decision
facetimes been decent whenever i used it
duo was interesting on a call to california
whatsapp video is decent
skypes skype
RIPPPP AP Physics kids taking the test BC thunderstorm
yea its bad
Rip them so bad if power goes out
its like
C#
lol angular
dreaded
HOW THE HELL IS REACT AND GATSBY THERE
why is ruby on rails there
it's so good
BRUHHH sometimes Gatsby is like ha u got 55 errors
and im like where
and it is like, ima crash vs kode
Gatsby is good
i like gatsby
if u know how to use it
yea, I j gotta learn how to use it lol
its really nice
im wondering tho
if for my blog
i should write my own ssg based on svelte
what is an ssg
or see if there is an existing ssg for svelte
static site generator
ooooo
that would b interesting to try
idk tho
i like gatsby
so ill probably just use gatsby
lol no one is visiting stack overflow in chad
lol india
lol india
the circle is larger than the country despite being so larger
yea... like 20%
hello u need it soupport
makes sense
yes
ur computer has virus
yeah it does make sense
getting mistborn vibes from this story im reading
you should read mistborn
it's a good book
you = everyone
vous

i just watched
all 1 minute and 50 seconds of that
lol
back to math
rip, im gonna hav to do dis next year
no dis ez
konik sekchins ez
well precalc
prekalkulis
hons precalc hard
right
hons precalc kinda hard
if u be like me
yeah very hard
honestly
is it like h chem hard
harder
harder
hardest class at ridge easily
fuk
much harder than chem
well
it depends
on what ur good at
i find it harder than chem
ap physics 1 is the easiest class at ridge
I good at physiks
or calc
tbh
physics actually makes sense
if i got a 90 instead of an 89 mp3
i stopped failling science
and did not get a 52 on the last test
i would be doing really well
but
i j got dr tong, and he dont teach way i like

the battery in my ipod wants out
effects of intellectual piracy:
i can see it slowly coming out
it clearly works
the magic smoke
will appear
i should probably stop charging it continuously
i can literally see inside it
the gap is that big
ow god
I need to replace the batt in my c940
lol
cy's recommended
How do dis?
got it
My calculator was having a meltdown
that's like
literally flask
no actually it is a little nicer
flask is already dead simple
if you could stand next to this all the time or next to flask all the time who would you choose
but i guess this is a little simpler for APIs
idk ive only known it for like 90 seconds
i have to redo 2 of my precalc homeowrks
cuz i did the wrong ones
lol
i do that
so i did more ellipse work rather than hyperbola work
and then i realized
shoot
what is a hyperbola
i must have messed up my homework
maybe ill try fastapi
cyAPI
l8r
cylask
i was gonna write my own fastapi
same
but then i was like
flask is already pretty much as easy as it gets
so
you should add the cyifier to the bot if you get a chance monsieur l'usb
d'accord
when i have a chance
maybe at apcs tmrw
c'est une idée bonne
bonne idee
not idee bonne
buena idea
c'est  une bonne idée
d'accord
lol ramesh ne sait pas espagnol aussi
je vais completre mes devoirs
d'accord
a tout a l'heure
adieu monsieur l'usb

bruhh
i am procrastinating chem and hush
so i must do work
i dont really know what im doing for my projects
have fun
when u r working on Gatsby and realise that it is 12:23
why is this an acid
cause its a per-something-ate
which is one of the acid naming things
are per-something-ates always strong acids
idk about strong acids
but they will be acids
wait
but that means that
HIO4
is a strong acid
wait
idk about that
but its an acid
no no hold on
nope
its not a strong acid
HIO4 has to be a strong acid
or it won't work
its not
then how does this work?
wait no its a strong one
we dont need to know it for class tho
he said this
you react it with water
HBr
HI
HClO4
HClO3
H2SO4
HNO3
HCl
and the 2 products
thats all u need to know for strong acids
ok but then how am i supposed to solve this problem
without knowing that
what problem?
the one i showed you
i asked him about this during class
and he said
you react it with water
this one?
and you examine the 2 products
yes
and you see
if the base is strong
and the acid is strong
if only the acid is strong
the solution is acidic
if only the base is strong, the solution is basic
if they are the same
dude
the solution is neutral
for that problem
its just the naming
its not asking strong or weak
its just asking is it nuetral, acidic, or basic
yes
the name of it
but
this has no name
but because CaOH is a strong base
and H2CN2 is a weak acid
CaCN2 is a base
yea for that
u react with water and find out the stuff
but so ur saying i can determine if it's an acid based on the name
if i am given it?
yup
where did it say that
in one of the things
if its a hydroxide
its a base
there r a bunch of stuff that if u have the name u can see if its acid or base pretty quick
huh
-ous is usually an acid
there r more
hmm

wait
does protonmail not let u alias ur email
cause u could just make one email
and make like 500 aliases for it
maybe
but this is easier
i just made another proton
done
fourth
imma ask you a couple things if u dont mind
This is not a a valid buffer system, because HPO$^2- is not a valid acid because acids don't have charges, therefore it is not  a buffer system.
Akhil
Mira
?
nothing
okay then its not what i thought it was
Do yo understand thou
yea
Becuase acids don't have charges
yea
becuase they are covalent
makes sense
idk what the relationship between the two could be then
None
There was no relationship
no there is
they are conjugates of each other
What?
this should be reversed PO4^3- is the conjugate base of HPO4^2-
They both have negative charges, so they can't be conjugates of anythig
oh
yea I guess
Depending on the equation
well
it will always be
cause itll always be H3PO4 + H2O
chem test
right
Yup
good luck
if you haven't taken it already
Panic
nah ur good
no
bc akash words
Yea i figured
Idk then
I believe its just a ionization ka
The ph of this individual ionization is 12.7
Akhil has an addiction
lol
Me: okay...
Me: uhhhh
Me: no thanks.
theres a us census for a reason
yea
its to collect that data
but
this is trying to collect a specific sample of people
lol google anaylitics on a hush project
ooo
I am arguing agenst big tech

nice one
it is funny how they have all the diff types of Asian, but no diff types of white/caucasion
This is interesting
The fact that hdds hav gotten this fast

Good
Wait should I be a company representative or an environmental/engineering researcher
idk
I think it is good
whats the difference between carbone and charbon
i think i know
charcoal
carbon
well the other way around
carbone is carbon
charbon is charcoal
ah
ok
ok one suggestion the last sentence maybe
maybe not tout les problèmes idk
that seems unrealistic
but it seems good to me even tho i dont take french lol
What about this tho
What would be more ethos
research engineer
What would be the official title tho
Like engineering researcher for the French association of energy?
Samantha Deane, Head Environmental Engineer of Le Petit Soleil
whatever
idk
what is le petit soleil
i thought it was the company
Random made up company
yeah that works
just keep it as of the company
if u wanna make life simple
THE HELL IS THIS NEW HITFILM EXPRESS LOGO
why
why did they change it to that
it soo ugllylylyly
Idk
Hitfilm started to go downhill for me
use
resolve
free davinci resolve
i know how to use hitfilm
maybe i'll use resolve next time
yeah...
this is an absolute problem
The reason
lol you used disallowed plugins
I stopped using hitfilm
idk maybe I should use resolve
but I'm already mostly done in hitfilm
I DIDNT USE ANY FKING PLUGINS HOLY S*********
is it running in demo mode
ofc it is
Imma use adobe premier
ok akhil
how much does that cost buddy?
Idk
The school pays for it i think
windows is dying i think imma have to reboot
maybe its a bad idea to open 50 apps at once
Thats how i have photoshop and illustrator for free
Very
i have no more start menu
or task bar
$20 a month akhil
what are other free alternatives
Uh resolve
^
Those the two big free ones i think
I should try resolve
But I can't imagine it's that much easier than hitfilm
Honestly
free
Windows photos
permiere is free
you can get it with the school
yes akhil is right
Yup
PC iMovie
lol
i just use resolve
I'm waiting for my computer to reboot
Resolve or Premiere those r ur two best bets

the video where i found it tho
like
i need some like somewhat grandiose music for the end tho
what should i use for that
uh
you could selectively use the same pixelate music
like get a chunk that ends at a grandiose part
also
i have grandiose music
U could also selectively use movie music
tbh
samuel
Those usually have really grandiose parts
you can just use this pheonix thing
it would probably work
for the entire thing probably
it creates urgency/tension needed for climate change
remember thjis
godammit I forgot about that stupid snapshot directory error
with hitfilm
i should really stop using hitfilm
resolve
that said it is working now
so i am fine
is this ok? pls send any comments/criticisms :)
it sounds decent
the ending is also fine since it leaves off with the panels
my french listening skills are garbage but it sounded mostly understandable as well but i cant tell you any details
ight all i want for this is a B so ill take it
ok nice video
the only thing its missing is those doodly animations
but other than that
solid french
solid ethos pathos logos
this is my current video
Bro how is urs 115 mb 🥴
lol idk
Mine was like 30
Although tbf mine is also in 1080 24 FPS
i exported to "YouTube 1080p HD"
whatever that means
probably like 1080 30p with medium compression
huh
hitfilm's file format is just XML
so i could technically just write python code to make my video for me
i could write a bash script
for ffmpeg
to make videos
yeah but that doesn't have a gui
handbrake
lol
handbroke
lol
why though
i mean
okay
i get it
it's a video
you are listening to Cy
cy is starting to hate hitfilm
its being bad
its like
how do you move the anchor point wihout moving the image
you
move the anchor point
then move the image back
akjsdflakjsdhfs
resolve
can resolve open hitfilm projects
tbh im done anyway
ill use resolve next time
ok it has some motion and an accent on Arrêtez
that's it
im done
...with the video
time to make a phonetic pronunciation guide and a reflection
ramesh
quoi
what was that library
oh that
that does the phonetic stuff
yes
epitran
can you make it create a pronunciation thing
it does french

imma make a transliterator website
powered by epitran
cuz its so ez
i bet i could get it done in less than 30 minutes
although that would be not fun
so maybe ill make it with Svelte
or ill learn how to use bootstrap once and for all
doesnt epitran
have a non ipa options
also why the HELL does your french teacher want a pronunciation guide
guidée
cdknight: guided
lol
wdym
like
the
wait
let me make epitran work one sec
ok
/aʃɛte/
IPA
actually nvm
what should it be
ash uh tay
idk
tbh
if i give her a transliteration
what why does she want a pronunication guide like what
why
is this going to be read by non-french speakers
so we pronounce things right
l'YUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUESSSSSSSSSSSSBIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
cyfinfaza: l'YUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUSSSSSSSSSSIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
so like that?
lol yes
no i think imma give her the epitran transliteration
lol
cuz technically all she wants is a "phonetic script"
theres probably a program for that
I just have to replace the numbers with their spelled out forms
and then put it into epitran
then I will add a note that the thing was made with epitran
WHY TF ARE MY LIGHTS FLICKERING
ASD:FLKASJHDF:LJSDKHF
i bet shes his sister

OH MY GOD STOP FLICKERING
WHAST IS THSI ASASA
ok lora
asaddfasdfasdfakldfasdfh
It’s haunted
are my lights having psu failure or something
Boo
this has been going on for a little while
but its really bad today
Its it cause it was raining/lightning?
idk
probably not
see the controller runs of power from my pc
over a usb extension cord
so i plugged it directly into a battery bank to see if that was the problem
but it still flickered
so its something to do with either the MOSFET or the psu
or some of the wires
frankly ill just turn off the lights
i dont need them anyway
Hello darkness my old friend
Hey Ramesh

My mom's iphone won't play m4a files
Do any of the iphone ppl know how to make iphones play m4a
What?
M4A is one of the native formats
Yeah thats what's weird
Download it to files and try that way
Thats what we did
This is all it let's us do
Then itunes/music
How do you put it in music
Not sure
All my music gets moved over
Hmm
Idk
Apparently the file was created on a huawei
So maybe it's a codec issue
Shouldnt be
It plays on my phone
All forms of m4a work on ios
Hmm
U could
Try emailing it to youself
And opening it that way
Otherwise just send it to a laptop and open it there
We tried that as well
It didn't work
But now
Thats weird
I installed VLC
And that can play it
Idk then
Idk either
But it works
So it's fine

hi im cy

Bonjour, je m’appelle Cy, et je t'écris de ma classe français 3 H. J'écris cette lettre dans Google Docs, alors il va y avoir des fautes qu’il trouve, et alors cette lettre représente comment j'écris quand je suis sur un ordi. Quand j'écris sur le papier je fais plus de fautes grammaticales et orthographiques. Je veux commencer avec quelque chose à propos de comment j’ai commencé avec le français. Quand j'étais petit, ma maman me parlait en français tout le temps. Elle et libanaise, alors d’ou elle vient, ils parlent l’arab premièrement, mais ils parlent aussi le français beaucoup et aussi l’anglais un peu. Mais quand j’ai entré l'école élémentaire, les enfants me parlaient en anglais, et alors mon progrès avec le francais à arreté. J’ai déménagé à Basking Ridge en 7th grade, et je devais choisir une langue à prendre. J’ai décidé que j’allais prendre le francais parce que je commençais une année en retard, et je connaissais déjà le français. J’ai aussi beaucoup de famille qui parle le français, alors ça allait m’aider à leur parler. Aujourd'hui, j’ai encore des problèmes orthographiques et avec la conjugaison, mais pas aussi mauvais que quand je commençais. Rappelez-vous - j’ai commencé une année en retard, et je ne savais pas du tout comment lire ou écrire le français. Mais, il y a aussi des choses avec lesquelles je suis encore très performant: des choses comme la compréhension, et le masculine/feminine.
Je veux aussi parler à propos des choses auxquelles je suis intéressé. J’aime vraiment les ordinateurs. Je fait beaucoup de sites-web, et d’autres programmes, et j’aime aider les profs et les étudiants avec leur ordinateurs. Cette année j’ai pris la course AP Computer Science, ou on a juste fini nos projets. Mon projet était un site web ou tu peux jouer à un jeu de Blackjack avec l’ordinateur. Je l’ai fait avec mon ami. Mais j’ai aussi fait beaucoup d’autres sites web, comme un qui te laisse écrire des programmes en Java et les faire marcher pour pratiquer et te teste pour le AP test. Cet été j'espère que je vais pouvoir travailler avec un ami de ma famille. Sa compagnie veut utiliser des technologies comme ReactJS dans leur sites web, et alors je veux leur aider. J’aime aussi la musique, mais beaucoup moins que j’aime les ordinateurs. Je jouais du piano, mais j’ai arrêté après que ma maîtresse a déménagé. J'écoute encore beaucoup de musique. 
Maintenant la période ici va finir, alors je vais devoir fermer cette lettre. Je suis surexcité pour l’été, mais aussi pour rentrer à l'école en Septembre. J’attend de pouvoir te rencontrer l'année prochaine (sauf si tu es Madame Koch, dans ce cas j'attends de pouvoir te revoir). A l’année prochaine!
-Cy

ah
ok noted
lol this helped my grade
from a C- to a C+
bruhh
thats not bueno
lol this why u do algebra
and u no need 2 year of calc
yea as long as u get AB done u should be good
ima do bc
cuz u can go from h precalc
to bc
yea
ppl say don't do that
they say its really bad
o
if ur confident in ur skills u go ahead
then ima do ab
calc bc in high school is really bad
what is diff of ab and bc
you need ab stuff
ab is the first part
to do bc
bc is the second
o
id say
do whatever ur teacher recommends for u
ima prob take it in coolage anyways cuz like there is no way around another calc class
true
i can only take AB
so im thinkin of doubling up AB and stats or smthing
oooo
u should do stats senior year
thats the plan
cuz that class is ez right
uh compared to calc yea
ye
lol my senior year gonna suck
ima go shit ton ap classes
idk i first have to get past calc and take some stupid exam next year
prof exam?
hahahahhahahahahhaha
yup
precalc project
YES
amazing
its gonna be cancer so i gotta study like months ahead of time
its worse than SAT math testing
rly
for precalc proficiency exam
calc proficiency
yea its cancer
i thought it was a precalc proficiency
nah i cant go up from precalc
its precalc, then calculus
then I can move up
which is kinda stupid if u ask me
ye
the new math superviser sux
no wait
hold the fcking phone
wait thats done not up
ah i see
ye
wait no they got rid of a pathway
from calculus to ap calc ab
normal one
welp
dude
guess im taking stat
that sucks
it is what it is
could u take stat then ab
cuz like we could then b in da same class
stat ends up being in my senior year
the new supervisor is awful
yeaaa
he almost made me take a prof exam for h alg to h precalc
even tho i got gud gradez
yea
its fine tho
u takin cs next year
uh probably econ
cause thats the major i wanna go into
ooo
or mathematics (even tho im in a lower level thing)
what about stats
or data sci
yea mathematics/statistics
or econ
sick
but idk how normal calculus will look on college apps
it shouldnt be the worst right
cause im still accelerated, but i shall make it fine
ye
dude we doin hush discussion
and its heated
oh yea those
im j sitting in my char
chair
and ppl are like yelling
and im like homieeeeee
tf
why
bc there are a bunch of leftists
that
like HARD
leftifts
would make sense actually
they dont know how to speak
and hav a convo
and im like bruhh
shhh
yea yelling
in a discussion
in school
is kinda stupid
super stoopid
i wish i was mediating the discussion
who is?
the teacher?
white girls
cause they r doing an awful job
cuz they got a group with half the class
so hab best project
cuz there b so many ppl
ahh
so even tho they dum
they get A+
cuz quanity
that
is stupid
yea
i wish i was in apush lol
i wanna watch a movie
apush is fun
yea
we watching star wars now
dude
sick
yea its great
i am j saying a few words
and hiding
bc they start screaming at me
cuz i am only republican
oh no
yea....
and it on capital riot
so im like
plz halp
Oh no
i wish u good luck
also the reason im going abroad, cause entrance exams r better than transcripts
god damn that sent late
Yeaaa
I was thinking, if I were to study cybersecurity
I would study in italy
wait whats the debate on?
yea thats a nice place
That
capitol riot?
Yea
thats a weird topic for a debate ngl
Ye
thats just asking anybody thats not the majority to get flamed
Bicycle
anyway
im done
this
has to be the dumbest
thing
they also proved that friction was not negligible
k forget that i was stupid they explained it later but still
no context it sounds stupid
that is dum
but I think there is an explanation
bc velocity should b constant bc u are not loosing or gaining energy
right
exactly
but the thing is
if the only force is earth's gravity then it will lose/gain energy
well no, bc gravity is constant, so speed will only inc until it reaches the speed of the gravity
or the force of it
like terminal velocity?
ye
yeah ur right
but that doesnt mean it's always constant velocity
well, once it reaches terminal velocity, speed is constant
so that means that you can assume the point in time your measuring the data is at the point were friction is nothing and the object had reached terminal velocity
so yes, velocity from the point of terminal velocity onwords would be constant
and because there is no other force. ie friction, it wont be slowing down or increasing in speed at different intervals bc there is no friction
huh, this is intaresting
idk how fix
w8, I fix
it is funny cuz my computer litarly j turned on like that
this is my spanish homework guys
1. she gives homework the tuesday before school ends
2. this is what we get to watch
lol
lol
that's a really low score for me tho
im waiting for the oracle to say "Ramesh stands next to people all the time lol"
lol
or worse yet
god forbid
I mean
you dont know probably 30% of the ppl in this group chat
svelte is fast
like
real fast
and
its actually really nice
like
really nice
the typing test is 140 lines of svelte
svelte
you dont wanna see what that looks like in react
its like
multiple lines
of code
that shouldnt be happening
yes
this is a typing test that aims for 100% accuracy
if you make a mistake
you are expected to fix it
like ur actually typing
then how come the I is marked wrong but everything after it is still green
also technically i am correct because dont is not a word
well you can make mistakes
but
not ones that offset the whole thing
also you type whatever it says
regardless of whether its a word or not
then theres this
um
get rid of strings that are like 9 characters long
that just gets really annoying
wdym
cy gets windows 11 beta
he will
on his laptop
it looks like chromeos
anyway
I have not seen it
how?
insider?
leaked
iso file
yeah apparently like
yeah
oo
imma illegally download it
send me it when u get it
ill install it in a vm to try it
got taken down
imma put it on a usb drive
if I can find it
wait
ok got it
sketchy hidrive download
nice
run it through virustotal
just to make sure
oof
send when u get it
k
ill send over macos beta if anyone wants it
i also just need to get it off my drive
ok u send when u get it
lol
i will
awww
mines still at 500kbps
can u not send 11gb iso files
2gb is max BUT
there are ways akhil there are ways
yea ill compress it
indeed
i might try to zstd compress it
cy
god damn it
dont compress the iso
its already compressed most likely
nope
its the .app
turned into a iso
can you tell any of your friends who are coming to csc tomorrow and are eating food there to fill out the form
there are people who said they are coming and have neglected filling out this form
idk who they are
i filled it out
yeah
you were the first to
Ayyyyy
Wow that's so fancy!!!!
ikr
I just plant them into the ground
lol
we were gonna do that
Like clear a patch of land
but
Putnam fence around it
then we would have to put up stuff
And plant
Yeah that's what we did
It's annoying
Cause field mice killed 5 of my plants already
we have 13 lol
And I have this intricate dewatering system
Yep your welcome
I have 24
Excluding the 5 dead ones
i see
im worried we killed them by not planting them correctly
It's not good
the roots were very small
Lol you wont
Ya know how I transplanted them?
and they were falling over
I pulled them out
lol
Like literally
Just plucked them out and replanted them
They're still alive
yeah we pretty much did that but a bit more carefully
They fall over on the first night
They'll come back up by tomorrow morning
i see
good to know
And fyi only transplant right before sundown or else they might die
why
Cause they need the night to adjust
interesting
No roots = no water
well we just transplanted them
Nice!
actually only 5 of them
were gonna do the other ones tmrw
Now go drench them with water
Like really water them
Like a lot
the problem is we put water on them
and they fell over
Oh
Yeah
Not on them
Into the soil
well no on the soil
and then the soil expanded
and they unfastened
Oh...
Plant them deep
Like literally have the lowest leaf  1 cm above the soil
hmm
ok we didn't do that
will do that later
You see the hairs on the side of the main stem?
yeah
Those can become roots
ooo
did not know that
So the deeper you plant them the more roots there are that can grow
So yeah don't be afraid to plant them deeper
ok
i will tell my mom that tmrw
we will bury them deeper
Or just pile more soil around them
true
Either way works! 🙂
imma upload the monterey iso
k nvm
um
i thought it was going to be different than this
use notcy
i need somewhere to upload this 14gb iso
notcy
74bluepineapples
ur gonna need to rise the limit up
its 14gb
wait
yeah
hold on
yea make the max like 20 or so
my options are 1, 5, 10, and unlimited
ah unlimited then
lol ok
or
ipfs
the software specifically designed for this
large file sharing over the internet
akhil
put it on ipfs
that would be cool
also ramesh
put it on ipfs
i want windows 11
i could
its gonna take forever
so ill just offload the iso somewhere else
if you put it on ipfs
there is no reuploading time
yea but done i have to host it on my comp?
or can i upload it and get rid of it
u have to host it
until the person downloads it
ugh this is annoying
right I have to get lunix setup
not lunix
dolphin emulator
lol i have 278 tabs open
i love vertical tabs
is that download done
ues
wait
I wish to talk to banjamin
QmatjGJU2Z1HnXgVZmFVMzvnYAeob4cSNNsChsPSytDNH5
cid?
lmk if you can
thx
downloading
how slow is it
like 25 minutes
yeah around that
ok this is
faster
than it was for cy or me
and the best part about ipfs
is it only gets faster
this is the sketchiest thing I have ever had in my downloads
cy is downloading my zipped school folder
lol
50%
got like 7 minutes left
85% got about 1 min left
yea i was on discord while downloading
so it went kinda slow
im using native ipfs
i think ur using the gateway
right
yea probably
im just downloading off the link
im using the ipfs client
ah i should
but im lazy to download it
3 minutes
lol my usb ports dont work for some reason
it wont mount the usb drive
lol
hows it going with the dl
also etcher says it doesn't have a partition table
yes
windows never has a table
since u cant flash windows
with etcher
u need someother tool
you have to use something else
exactly
except it always works on vms
there was a really good one for windows
i forget
i think the official one MAY work with an ISO
idk
nah even normal windows doesnt work
i am 96 with like 50 seconds left
and done
booting the vm
wait you have to install it
?
?
its an iso
so u gotta go through the entire thing
but i think
it would offer an upgrade route
when its official
i dont have enough space
lets see why
it's installing rn
i need to clear some space
cy's downloads folder
lol
lol
lol
lol
lol
lol
it uses IE
lol
isn't that IE dropdown
literally
lol
ooh blur
also why does that font look like cyfont
how big should i make the storage
the UI is
inconsistent.
wtf is this awful ms paint
lol rounding inconsistent
internet explorer is not included
yeah this is basically like a windows whistler preview lol
it's of that quality
im currently attempting installation
that
doesnt look bad
kinda expected cause eol is next year i think
how come ur corners aint there
widgets huh
lol
Lol
JavaScript at its finest
Yes
Please join for free child labour
Thx
When google starts recommending you the MDN docs
i get recommended random stuff
filancial niteracy
yes
its such a hassle
hi my name is javascript
gl typing that
at least there aint no spaces
u should also prob
make wpm reflect accuracy
instead of raw typing speed
wpm reflects wpm
if you want one relative to the accuracy
you look at the bars
on the graph
they are based on acpm
adjusted characters per minute
which is the actual unit you want
Yup
Hey guys
I need a secondary drive
What should I get
I already have the Samsung 970 evo 1 rn
Tb not rn*
probably get a hard drive
if you want a lot of storage
or get like
a cheap ssd
like a micro center one
also sam
All I need is 1 rn
Tb*
did you give me back my gpu
that I lent you
No don’t think so
Lemme get it rq
just bring it over sometime
its not urgent
Right here 🙃
lol
ok
whenever you have time
just text me
and you can drop it off
What’s a good, cheap ssd
Samsung 860/870?
not a samsung
get a sabrent
or a micro center/inland premium
How is this one
thats similar to what I have
mine was cheaper tho
lemme send
cheaper and it seems to work well so
vercel is pronounced ver-cell for the record
i just checked
how else would it be said
ver-sull
vercél
people really say it like that?
i was saying it like that
like
versal
its cel so it makes like a cell sound
idk
ive been saying like that
regardless
its pronounced ver-cell
companies ought to put pronounciation things somewhere
lol
huh
these appear to be my symptoms
my lights are doing kinda that
hmm
when it dies it sends out a message with why it reset
cause 4 is apparently a reset initiated by the hardware watchdog timer
314 days of uptime
Please
Update and reboot
I'm going to 16 handles
Apparently it's an ice cream shop
In case anyone wanted to also go there
FOOOOOOOOOOOD
feu
My network infrastructure did not recover after the 6 hour power outage at my house
Something is broken
Holy cow u have had so many power outages the past couple months
No we were having a generator installed
So they had to stop the power for 6 hours
Ah that makes sense
Haproxy is not dead
I officially hate onsite hosting
What is this
Why
ah that's why
my ip address changed
Yea thats always kinda a hassle
well it hasn't changed in like a year
so i thought it would never change
But i contacted my isp and just told them to try and never change it
i should do that
or
hear me out
not use onsite hosting.
U could
Its easier for me
although i kinda have to
for certain things
meh
lemme go to my dns and change all my entries
oh my god this is going to take a while
…
Oh god
Welp have fun
ill just only change the relevant ones
i should maybe use ddns
This might be why u use a dynamic thing like no-ip
yeah
i had that
but they waneda make me pay
alternatively
i could just write my own
U could
that identifies if my IP changed
and then contacts cloudflare
theres an api
on cloudflare
you can write you rown
yeah
alternatively
i could just make one domain
and then cname all the rest of them to it
so i only have to change one
That plus whatever u said above
Is the best way
yeah
i think i can free my vultr tho
and host some stuff there
cuz um
vercel can host playtools
even tho its server side rendered
i will cname everything to that
wait cloudflare has fancy options
for programmatically doing this
^^^
yeah but this is much easier
i just download them
find and replace
all a with cname
then reupload it
goddamit fck you wtf i just
i just
a;sdlkfja;sldkfja;slkdfj;asldkfj
now i
now i have to go and
delete them all
again
anafsdfa;lsjidkhf lakjsdhf alsdkfh
Ah yes
smh
maybe i should use the cloudflare api
but it would still take less time to do it this way
It would
Idk i wanna actually finish up my websites this summer
I AM GOING TO FCKING KILL SOMEONE
IT DID IT AGAIN
Dude

cdknight: fire
when you drill a hole through your samsung and it still kinda works
gold
HA
RAMESH?;?!?!?!??
Wait that's Ramesh right
Yup
The one and only
What’s a good normal ssd
the nvme one would force my gpu to blast hot air onto my psu
Also how do uou clean out pc dust lmao
ur case has filters
take them off
and wash them
with water
then dry them
that usually works for me
especially your psu filter
that one is on the bottom
and it gets real bad real fast
my pc was being very loud
so i cleaned it
and now its quiet
Ight thx
What abt the ssd
idk
samsung is not bad
also sandisk
or maybe wd
or inland
the main difference is going from nvme to not nvme
the brand doesn't matter that much
it might affect longevity tho
so like
if you want it to last a while
This will be my secondary drive
maybe get a samsung
How’s this ^
good
its like $10-20 more than the others but its a samsung so it will last longer probably
u should also clean/wash your hdd/ssd
it makes it faster
just soak it in water for some time
ideally remove the case to clean out the chips a bit as well
it gets rid of the corrosion and whatnot
at the end u should throw it in an oven to clean it out
Remember to pull the chips off before putting it in the oven
Or else the water under them won't dry
u can also eat the chips
they taste better than potato chips imo
but then ur ssd wont work
but they taste GOOD
i also recommend dipping them in Magic Smoke
nvidia bread
wrong chat
i now have
a testimonial
isnt that like some geometry dash/impossible game song
i feel like ive heard it before
and I want to know what the song actually is
Crazy train

buy a quail egg peeler
quail egg peelers are too expensive

why do you need it tho
i mean
kvm
yea its a nice camera
but
u need to pay like 80$ on top of that
for the lens no?
yea
also I already have an okish camera
i mean if u want to upgrade thats not a bad deal
hate the color
but thats not a bad deal i think
"women's color" probably
i mean
anybody can wear it
its just a more of would u
i dont really care
but then again
im not in the market for headphoens at the moment
im not really either
but i might
wait
this
is what I was asking about buying
oh yea
thats not bad
it might be low quality tho
not that i care for what im trying to do with it
well it has pretty good ratings
i mean u can buy and try it
if its bad then return it
no
they say it's bad
33 dollars for the other thing
many eggs
lol
lol I j bork my phone
and lcd bork
and like bruhh
this is like my 6th phone bc of me
being a dumbass

I droped it on my patio in the one area where the screen was not protected by the case cuz infinity displays
mico is learning mapbox
and after 100000 errors
I got kinda something
i still dont know tf i am doing
when u think things are going well
join
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
would u join the military
maybe air force
oooh
or...……..space force
u know in the military they have those parts that do technology stuff
with computers and whatever
yea
im pretty sure it exists
yeah
that is what I would wanna do
i would probably join that if I had to
yeah
but i wouldnt be opposed to joining the military
i would join airforce recherch labrotory
i bet no one would expect that out of me
i was thinking of doing rotc in collage
and u become officer in airforce
mm interesting
i dont know too much about it
but like, only hav to do 4 years of 'service' witch is j recherch
i doubt my parents would let me join the miltary in any form
seems not bad
ye
but
idt it is nessassary
cuz it would hold u back in private industry
or
like u could make connections
cuz u work with private industry
tru
or u could just
work there for the entirety of life
and then retire after the x yearse
u no make monee
yea but
does the us have lots of benefits for exmilitary pplsz
u get the same benefits even after 4 years
after 4 years is just like bruhh
i mean
u could make more monee in private instry
tru
or just invest ur money in wsb stonks
as if
gambling works
FAX
gamestonkks
IKR
and for some reason this works

gentoo install time
yep
it's gentoo install time
lol
bruhh
compiling the linux kernel does fun things
now I get to do it again
since I had the fun idea of deleting my build otuput
my esp isnt working
then I find this in the code
something is calling die()
someone needs mental health support
i dont know what yet
time to manually trace through someone's code
feels a lot like
ah here it is
this is the best score ive recieved
heck yes
eh mines not a portfolio site so acessibility or seo dont matter at all
what are u making
its the highest best practices ive recieved
lol
a simple startpage
cause i was bored
you mean like
a new tab page
yes
a startpage
cool
nah its too much
i just need a few links
ok
mabye i should add a search bar
im trying to make someone's LoRa Gateway firmware build and actually work on my ESP32
that would be handy
ah gl trying to do that
and ramesh
i first have to stop it from calling die()
im doing
this
cool
i love this capture card
imma keep working on my esp
interesting
so
its trying to read the chip's version register
and its not matching any of it's known "versions" (aka LoRa modem types)
then its die()ing
but i think it has the wrong pins
so its probably not reading anything
WAIT IT WORKED
I UNBORKED IT
AH WHAT IS IT DOINGGGGGG
ITS THROWING EVERY ERROR CODE THERE IS
all i did was change the web server port to 80
guess ill just leave it at 88
meh
LibreNMS
TTN wont tell me it's connected
porquoi
pourquoi
i think the problem is that TTN does not know which gateway is mine
i just told it i have a gateway
but i never told it which one
but then my gateway has this id
so i put it in TTN
but it still wont tell me that its connected
tbh
i have no clue how this works
is this MQTT
no
this is LoRaWAN
the one i sta|
ok cy
and still
dont know anything about lora
perhaps I should
the problem with LoRaWAN is that there are like 86 different degrees of freedom
so like
if one of them is not right
the whole thing doesn't work
cool
yay bootloop
lol me 3 minutes ago
lol me plugging in the usb into the usbc dongle because im too lazy to find the usb ports on the back of the computer
WAIT IT WORKED
IT FOUND THE GATEWAY
THE GATEWAY WAS FOUND
we're in business
now its time to actually send data
ok so apparently every other time my gateway boots up it fails due to a flash read error
good to know
TTN is driving me nuts
maybe i should just selfhost chirpstack
but then i have to figure out chirpstack
im trying to make it bigger
and fullscreen
kinda
It will be the size of the container you make it in
i used ur kode as like a baseline to figure out what i was doing
i did
Idk then
but like, what is the css thing for the full screen
Oh
width 100vw
Height 100vh
much thx, ima try that
K
ok, that helped, but now map is like off the page

Except for post.jsx
And Map.jsx
map.jsx is no more
Lol
post.jsx tho
that will always b there
Yea
Michael wrote his own kode for once
Honestly as long as you make it open source
yea
And include a credit in the files where u copied my code

my nextcloud has a lock on this 250gb file I need to delete
so I look up this tutorial online
or forum post
or whatever
and it says
go into the MySQL
find the oc_file_locks table
and delete everything
except
it returns nothing
so
um
uhh
and it still says locked
lol I fixed it
then i delete the file
then i re enable file locking
oh right i forgot to say
cuz why not...
oh and i did a silverbench of the Surface Pro X
self-promotion
lol
im trying to get an android 12 beta build running in a vm
i wanna see the new ui
but idk how to do this
im pretty sure in order to do this i need to build from source
but idk how to do that
do you have 300gb free
you need 300gb free to build android
i have like 270gb free
now that i deleted that file
apparently this is a requirement
but imma try it in wsl anyway
actually that's probably a bad idea
it is
cux
1. my wsl doesn't work
and 2.
idk how to launch the emulator from there
WSLg
?
what if i installed my GSI on a raspberry pi
you could
WSLg
does that actually work
probably not
i have a pixel 3a xl
but the screen doesn't work
so its pretty useless
and its also not unlocked
meh
imma eat dinner
bye
i was gonna send a screenshot of how much storage i have left
but
the screenshot couldnt save
WAIT
I CAN BUILD ANDROID IN REPLIT
YES
I think replit has unlimited storage
have fun with the 1 week build times
cy
get distcc
and then distributed compile it
on hundreds of replits
lol
no what imma do is not build it
and just try and get my gsi working
want me to build it for you?
sure
ok ill see
ok
dammit wtf is my monitor doing
its flickering like crazy
and there are lines going down it
and there is burn in
all of a sudden
i can see the ghost of my past failures in the burn in
wtf is this
like literally
out of nowhere
its just dying
also its not burn in
its like
digital image memory
it has memory of every other pixel
from one frame that was being displayed
like
5 minutes ago
and its overlaying this on the actual image
so this is why dell monitors are twice as expensive for the same thing
they dont die
unlike this HP crap
lol i guess a flickery display with lines going down it is better than no display
wait i think its still under warranty
i got it like
a few months ago
apparently this issue just goes away
whatever
ill wait
partitions are being moved
aw windows bluescreened
I guess you cant move partitions around while windows is hibernating
NTFS filesystem level compression is underrated
i just freed up 16GB
of 88GB
Lol
I have ZFS compression enabled by default
I think it uses LZO
its only taken me until 1am to get it to build for more than 30 seconds without crashing
now it builds for 3 minutes before crashing
rainbow
Ah yes
genius
im still trying to build android
ive given up on trying to do it on my internal ssd
im now building from my external archive hard drive
you do not understand
it took
a solid 20-30 minutes
but i think its gonna work this time
cy improvising
its kinda bad but i was only at the piano for like 10 minutes
ok building android on my archive hdd also failed
imma try it on one of my servers
acutally i cant do it on my nextcloud server
it only has 8GB ram
imma try this on the 4h server
it has 16 cores and 24gb ram
i have more ram than that
and my cpu is way better
what do I do
tell me how to
I will literally do it for you
I have 12 cores of a 5900x
I mean its not that hard I can tell you how to
and you can do it
ok tell me how to
but I also kinda wanna do it myself
you can
ok heres how to
one moment
btw I use arch
anyway I think I have all of those
they suggest using ubuntu
im not installing ubuntu just for this
maybe ill do it in a container
idk itll probably work
ok next
oh right
or the arch equivalent
ok
done
make a working directory
inside the working directory
ok it's downloading
done
ok
now
this is the command that takes forever
you have to select the j count thing
number of threads
ok
i would do like
24
48 or something
ok
i did 24 on my computer
i did 128
the thing is you may be network limited
so idk if it matters that much
lol
basically after that
you might need to install this random thing
like
then from there its fairly straightforward
to prepare the environment
then
you have to do lunch
which will configure the build
it will show some random config info on the screen
then you run
just the letter m
and it will build it with multicore/multithreading enabled
OK my computer rip
I'm getting 32gb more ram today so I think it will be good
64gb total
lol ok
ill run it with the letter m
Did it finish sync
lol i broke WoR
and
no
it
is
dying
my
type
ow
cannot
computer
sad
Cy
How many gbs does repo download
About 140
ugh
yay
repo sync nightmare over
ok cy
I get to rebuild everything now
yay
Ben and I are getting ice cream
We biked on white bridge road
FOOOOOOOOOOOD!!!!
Microsoft Windows
Panos Panay Edition
how do I run it
cyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
here we GOoooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOoooooooOOOooooOOOooooOOoo
ramesh is not ok clearly
cool
now is it android 12
and also
how on earth are you supposed to let me use the build
jfyi
it doesnt have a lock screen
what other features should I look at
is it android 12
ipfs
or android 11
no i know we could use ipfs to transfer it
but how do i run it
i have no space
it's android T
does it have the new UI
um
no
oh
i want the one with the new UI
wtf is this
i have no clue
frankly
i might just take my Mi A1
unlock the bootloader
install project treble support
and then install the android 12 beta gsi
lol rip three hours
lol
do you know how long i spent on this
i spent like 5 hours yesterday
i did this like 3 times
lol
lol
lol im sad lol
no but i think you can just checkout the android 12 beta code
the one with the new ui
and then do an incremental build
which takes less time
lol tell me how
this is the step i dont know how to do
lol
um
im currently watching the windows event
then imma try and figure that out
lol cy
sorry im gonna be blunt with u
but ur stupid
u can download the android S image from android studio
and run it in an emu
lol ramesh
sorry im gonna be blunt with u
let me guess u tried
but ur stupid
and im stupid
lol
i tried that
what happens
its just the developer preview
no fancy new ui
hmmm
so far the only thing i found that has the new UI supposedly
is the GSI build
on the android website
but you need a treble compatible device
can u get it to run on a pi
i dont think the pi is treble compatible
so i was like
is there a treble emu
is the nexus 6p treble compatible
idk hold on lemme see
also
it has the new ui
wait they updated it?
HAHA
lol cy
lol
ur stupid
give it a try
imma try it
which one did you pick
for the image
and which device
i create new virtual device
pixel 4a
x86 images
api s
also this looks like samsung settings
avd is being annoying on windows
it wants me to install some thing
r/linuxmasterrace
you dont understand
yesterday
it was not asking me for this
^
I do understand
the answer is lunix
until you want touch support
until you want Bluetooth audio that works
until you want wireless displays
until you want ms office
lol bluetooth audio works just fine
lol touch support and gestures work
lol whats a wireless display
lol emacs
lol emacs
lol emacs is best
lol i had hyperv enabled
so it got mad
except
i did not enable hyperv
it enabled itself
um
lol wsl
wsl2 supports gui apps
on insider builds
wslg
im an active member of the vGPU unlocking community
we talk about this kind of stuff a lot
cy
wanna do me a faovur?
ok
do u still have an install of windows on raspberry
i think i do
ok so
can you check if you can enable hyperv
on it
lol that would be interesting
i can check
it would save me a lot of time
im benchmarking
esxi vs kvm (linux hypervisor) vs (now) hyperv
on a pi
interestingly
kvm takes the lead in cpu performance
easily
i have my doubts about hyperv on pi
it's not pi
it's aarch64
ok i finished watching the windows event
it was actually not bad
da
it was not as cringy as it could have been
im watching star wars
but tell me if hyperv is enabled
i will attempt that
thanks
i have to first find all the related items
lol
also my install of windows on raspberry is like
it is going to take a while for this to do things
ancient
this is running on a vm
ok hmm
you can try anyway if you think it's interesting
but i can still check
i could also get a new install
they have made significant improvements
you could
you should
but i muted their discord server
cuz it was annoying me
it takes a bit
so idk what they changed
lol im in it
but you can do that
imma go watch this movie
ok
if you do choose to do things lmk
i could just google it
last i checked it was a thing
what is lmk
let me know
ok
i found my pi
lol my pi #6
lol
next target
Mini HDMI to HDMI adapter
searching...
found
apparently new versions support dual displays
lol mines already hooked up
what is already hooked up
my pi
mine is too
its booting
i need to find a keyboard and mouse
honestly i find it funny that they can get the latest builds of windows running on a pi
but android
nope
um
is that old
idk
should i try to get a new build running
yes
it takes so long
you have to do all this ntlite crap
well there
it took one script
to build an iso
then you just run through the WoR exe file
where is said script
this may be the first time this phone has root
the problem is
idk what to do now
but its probably not hard to find out
I need to unlock the bootloader
now that I have root
cy
you do not need root to unlock a bootloader
unless this is some kind of unofficial unlock
this is some kind of unofficial unlock
lok
this is an AT&T device
*lolk
good luck
im watching am ovie
which ROM do I attempt to install tho
oh
unofficial lineageos
probably
since thats all i know
i need one that works for this device
G900A
by checking the device type
which in safestrap is just ""
so apparently
you can solve this by going into the install script
and deleting the line that checks for compatibility
lol
is it normal for it to sit on the splash screen for a long time after flashing a rom
yes
like not the loading screen
for too long though and it would've failed
the splash screen
yes
the little bubbles
like the one that says samsung
keep sliding across the screen
oh
no
ok
yes
no
thats wrong
ok
im still watching a movie though so
ok
wtf
this is horrifying
oh god
thats
kinda messed up
should I install custom rom on my emm ahh ehh one
sure
do it
i kinda dont wanna lose my data tho
back it up then
how do i back all of it up
like
um
cuz like
if i boot to TWRP
im not sure for android
theres a "backup" option
supposedly
which will take images of the partitions
but i have heard it doesn't actually back up user data
it only backs up the ROM
um
idk
u would have to look into it
cause i usually just plug my phone in and press backup and sync
Idk I've never used it
Use titanium backup or whatever for user data
do i have to be rooted to use that
Yes
also can i root or unlock bootloader without losing data
No
Lol
Back up manually is what I did
hmm
im crusing through my ap gov work
congressional debate did a good for me
lol
i want to install custom rom on my mi a1
but i also want to back it up
and idk how to do a full backup
so what if i buy this
for $5
5 dolla
link longener
lol these b def stolen
no custom rom
lol
this actually
just adds get params
Embedded be like
want to do things?
sure, hook me up to an arduino uno
UART things
lol RS232
let me tell you something
for GODS sake this should be running not systemd
i am going to try and index the internet again
oh gods no
my main issue last time was that my database was bad
cyearch v3
it was too slow
and it used too many resources
mongodb was not meant for this
so instead
ill write my own db
specifically for this purpose
foundationDB
oh right
do in person hackathons exist yet
this should not be running ubuntu
lol 110MB of ram
make it run alpine or smthing
buildroot
boots up in like 2 seconds
really?
is this the pinecube
yes
devkit
why is it connected to an arduino
uart
why do you need that
for the terminal?
yes
ah
i see
ok now time to run ffmpeg
nah iperf3
apparently you have to wire rst and ground to disable the microcontroller
which is interesting
yes
you pull RESET low
this keeps it off
then you connect your target RS232 device to the TX and RX pins in reverse
then you can connect to the device through the serial to usb converter
onboard the arduino
i have used this hack before
interesting
i am using it now
wait but
not bad iperf3
for a trash ip camera
you didn't connect the ground
what
between the Arduino and the cube
no
i didnt
you are supposed to
why
the tutorial said not to
um
well not explicitly
but why
are they both plugged into the same power source
no
well yes
my computer
different usb ports
well then the grounds are technically matched
but if you were to plug one of them into a different power source
then it would not work anymore
or it might
but it would be unreliable
thanks for the tip
I will
yw
do that
i want to benchmark this SoC
ok
im learning about binary search in python
so i can make my db
excellent
imma learn about systemtap
after this
it needs to be able to very very quickly identify the presence or absence of an item in a list
right now the binary search can find an item in a 100 million item list in about 1ms
dont mind me
generating 1 billion random floating point numbers
idk if i even have enough ram for this
lol um
what happens now
wait it finished
ok i dont get how this works
i mean
1 billion numbers
is 1 giganumber
and if each number is about 12 digits
that would make about 12GB
no wait
that's not how math works
12 bytes is about 28 digits
hmm
okay
it would make 12GB if they were 12 character strings
lol I forgot I have to sort that list
lol it took a solid minute and a half just to find an item in it
im going somewhere this evening
hopefully its done sorting by the time i get back
i might write this in rust
can i ask you something
in this example
what happens
hmm
go vs rust
which do i choose
im reading some article
rust is faster
go has better concurrency and its easier
still sorting
maybe i should just make a list that's already sorted
or maybe i should just stop that process
bc i have lost interest in that endeavor
btw i chose go
goroutines
i wanna try a language specifically built for concurrency
i found another header easter egg
what
reddit
alright i dont entirely get that one
see go actually implements one of the things i was envisioning for my language
elixir implements
it has that command
some of the things I was envisioning for my lanugage
isn't that how you start a goroutine?
yes
im not sure i entirely like goroutines yet
honestly
rust async is a thing but it's bad
lol
you just say
here are 1.2 million things to do
do them please
and it just
also go doesn't have while loops
which is kinda what i had envisioned
all loops are just the same thing
JavaScript tho still has the best anonymous functions
arrow functions
mm yes
Wall e
On new fone
lol
not the screenshot from the iPhone se?
that was my favorite wallpaper
hahahaha
that was great
the only reason I had that was bc I lost the pic
and did not know how to use photoshop
lol
cy is making cyrchdb
in go
Michael is doing ap gov work at job
lol
i should do summer assignments
but i wanna learn go
u taking ap lang
no
hell no
yayaya
I can now b in cy class
yes
Aww
that would b funee
I signed up for it
to see cy struggle through ap lang
im doing AP Research
ur fucked
Idk i might drop it later
AP Research > AP Lang
rly
i did deb8 instead of ap recherch and stuff
yeah
so now i taking ap personal finance
although
cuz i need the creditz
AP Research is more of a replacement
Ah ap Econ
because it is also AP
ye
yea and capstone
I can only do Econ
did u kno we can get stuff for ied and comp sci
im doing ap gov/econ
and ap physics
I only have one elective stuff
im doing that + ap personal finance
Same
and ap physics
im also doing ap physics
and ap calc
and ap research
skary
so 4
i only doing 3 : (
I think I’m also 4
some ppl are doing 5
i could if i did no do language
those ppl have brain dead
Ik ppl who r doing 6
some ppl are taking 2 ap sciences
ap gov econ
ap lit
I was thinking of doing 2 ap science
ap calc
but I need the creditz
for personal finance
i do not want to take 2 sciences
cuz I could not do over da summer
y
i only want to have to think about one form of science at a time
also i cant
since im doing ap research
🙂
o
i was thinking of dropping Italian for other ap class
but was like bruhh
ima do die
cuz i got h precalc
wich should b an ap class
cy has to figure out how to run a package other than the main one
in go
lol
i wish i had a resource like that
i mean
i am doing roket stuff this weekend
🚀
so i test
and it go maybe boom
cuz before i was like
ur mom is finally letting u
no
my dad is
ah
without telling mom
lol
so shhh
ok
cuz liek
i did the calculationz
for roke
t
and was like, it not going boom
ok...
send video
but this is Michael math
ye def
lol
Michael math
its like
i forget the dumbest things
cy is learning go
its interesting
not that hard
Michael will go back to ap gov work
ok
cuz i gotta do work cuz big vacation in august
i see
ok
go do work
bye
bye
mikael has job
@ the pool
i was gonna work there
but
Covid happened
no
i just
didn't end up doing it
but to some extent
I need to find volunteer things
that's fine
Huh
cuz like
i dont have much time anyway
and im working for that person potentially
Oh nice
shes gonna meet with me on monday
or tuesday
lol you should look at my GitHub status
go has just lost points
it doesn't have a ternary operator
because it is "ugly"
um
excuse me
ur ugly
for making me write 5 lines of code to do the same thing i could do in one line with a ternary operator
theyre like
use if/else
but you know
you can make a ternary with if/else
that's how python does it
from what i recall rust actually does very well in this category
it doesn't have a ternary operator
but
you can use if/else and match inline
if i recall correctly
this may cause me to not use go
i use inline if statements continuously
GO IS DRIVING ME INSANE
IT DOESNT HAVE TUPLES
IT DOESNT HAVE TERNARY
who on earth designed this language
i feel like i just bought a 2021 flagship phone
i just lost a bunch of features i had in python
im gonna try rust
this is the most graphic representation of my failures I have ever seen a compiler give me
"See, this one is a &str, this one is a &str, but this last one is not! I was expecting it to be a &str like the rest of them, but instead it's a struct String. This is why it failed."
honestly
im a fan
welcome to rust
where strings are not actually strings
*yawn
yeah
&str and String
one is the borrowed type and one is the boxed type
anyway
i have a question
can I use the same arduino hack we discussed on a raspberry pi
Yes
But you may have to enable the serial terminal
I don't think it's enabled by default
apparently the UART pins are the same as the 5v pins?
also why
does EVERY tutorial say that I need some chip to use with the arduino
Ok no
That is not true
That is
Wrong
ok
then im dumb
since i came to that conclusion
this one tho
Idk rn
I'm watching a movie
I can look l8r
k
that said you need some chip
ok so these are the pins
these are the pins
ok so
i uh
I think I looked at the wrong tutorials
they were for serial from the arduino or something
but idk
Lol ok
ima go to sleep
Gn
gn
hi charles
hi Cy
Ah welcome back
hello
does anyone want to do something
like bike
or talk
or meet somewhere
or walk
uh i cant do any of those
sorry
ok
Sorry I can't do that today 😞
cy will know what this is about
when you ask for a json
like
someone
explain to me
how
how on earth
the json i want is
ah unicode i presume?
its probably from a db
this is the json i want
like
how can it even take up that much space
each character
well im writing a db
and space
whats also kind of funny
is that it repeats
and that its not even a json
smh go
the hell is this
stupid db
lol
imma make go give me a json
im trying to convert an interface into a json
please dont ask me why
Bonjour, je m'appelle Marshal.
Je transformerais votre interface a un JSON
cy r u trying to index the internet again
yes
smh
y
stop doubting me
i can do it
1200%
lol
once i get go to give me a json
using the Marshal function
we are getting closer
my new bible
ramesh wanted me to read his bible
curse u ap gov
lol, is it the rust wiki or somthing
no its Brandon Sanderson
the books he writes look interesting
u should read it
they r good
akhil agrees
yk what
I will
start with the way of kings
ye, I am gonna read
when done with English read
time to get official windows 11
lol when gmail becomes stackoverflow
windows 11 supports WiFi 6E
i thought that was just a driver-level thing
but i guess the OS also needs to support it
dude
I j looked at the ap phy 1 summer assignment
lol
and I wanted to bash my head into a wall with the amount of work they gib
yes
yes
its like
heres 50 problems
each with 4 parts
and here is 50 more
ikr
they say 6-7 hrs to complete
but that is straight work
with no procrastonate
idk imma not frontload that
bc its not actually graded
they are just gonna test us on it
apparently
yea
this ez stuff
im still gonna do it
im gonna do it
but not rly gonna try
but l8r
ye
that
im updating to windows 11
oooo
like fr
or j a vm
on my laptop
the insider preview is available as of this morning
ooo
fr
on actual hardware
I update
ye
ye
ye
i update
wait
act
dont update unless you can deal with buggyness
i wanna see if it is bad
so ima wait
yeah
let me update
then i tell u
if it bad
although
the thing is
it can be good
but then they can push an unstable update
and then it is bad
but then they can fix it again
this is my experience with the windows insider program
some of the builds are really good
but others not so much
you get updates about every 1-2 weeks
bruhh wifi is dyig
its like the electro boom thing
with the packets
cuz i am at pool job thing
and they got bad wifi
finally
I see cy messages
cy
a stack overflow is an actual bug
I started it at like 9am the day before school started
and then i found out it was optional
yes ik
Lol
hey it worked
lol
go is actually working
Cy will index the internet
yes
he will
This is what Cy needs to listen to
While updating windows
hi my name is go
i do not have named parameters
i do not have optional parameters
i do not have overloaded functions
screw you
yay
yes
i just had to increase ram to 4gb
lol
mine is at 65% of the third step
1. Download
2. Install (in os)
3. Install (from recovery)
huh
mines still fsiling to download
which is annoying
im curious
how does your vm have a TPM 2.0 chip
uh
it doesnt
interesting
nvm it wont install
ugh
i need the iso
once urs finishes could u see if u can make an iso using the thingy
what thingy
u know that center app that allows u to make isos?
MediaCreationTool?
yea that
you can just download that
from the innernet
but it only makes stable isos
ah
i need the dev iso
ik there are websites that just pull the data from ms servers
like the windows update servers
that's how you make a Windows on Raspberry Pi image
in the meantime
i have to figure out
in which alternate universe
this
is equal to 24
windows 11 is slowww
either that or Lenovo Yoga Mode Control is taking 25% of my cpu or something
it no longer detects my fingerprint scanner
red
Pls
Left center the taskbar
nah
I prefer center aligned
that is
until there is not enough space left
then it looks really ugly
so ill probably keep it left aligned on my laptop
I'm connected to an external display rn
mac
um
u know how like windows 10 was 21h1 or something
oh that
um
i think its 21h2?
no 21h1 was the last windows 10 update
im not sure
i can check the settings app
yea i need the version to install the iso
if that helps
ah yea thanks
that works
cool
go reminds me of c
like maybe here and there
but the majority of it is functional
rather than object oriented
go is very verbose
its also really easy to learn
because it cant do anything
so there is very little to learn
i swear this would be literally half as much code in python
but theres something ok about it
like
you just keep adding brackets and parentheses and types until the red lines go away
and when the red lines are gone
it kinda just works
unlike rust
where my variables get swallowed by the black hole that is ownership
go deals with all that pointer nonsense for me
like you just type something
and if it knows it needs to be a pointer it adds the &
or if it knows it needs to be dereferenced it just adds the *
go has a garbage collector
ik
mutex time
i think cyrchdb is ready
i am going to test it with my existing python crawl script
of course replacing all the mongodb queries with cyrchdb queries
of which there are only 3
read: get a url to search
complete: mark a url as searched, and mark whether or not it worked, as well as the status code returned
introduce: upsert urls into the database
hi my name is cyrchdb
where mongodb would be crashing your pc
i am using 2% CPU
when you think you got a good deal on a monitor
like it doesnt come out in the video
but even when im not moving windows around
the screen is flickering like theres no tomorrow
code
TO THE MOON
look it looks like a roket
isnt that cool
yeah
cy
you know whats not cool
do you know what language this is
my monitor
windows 11
lol
ah
I had a monitor that had orange corners
I replaced it
sad since it costed so much
lol
i mean I still have it
i dont throw out computer things
the monitor i have was $100
i was like
mine was
um
400
when I was an 8th grader suffering from chuunibyou
lol
my HP monitor was $100 and my Dell monitor was $200
despite being the same spec-wise
but the HP looks like it was designed at some ODM in China and it fails
I have two lg monitors
and a graphics tablet thats also a monitor
idk how much they costed tho lol
lol
i want a high res monitor
that runs at higher than 100% scale
that monitor that was 400 dollars
was 4k
idk it would take way too long to convince my parents to buy me another monitor
lol
how many are you at rn
2
although
i have all the 4H monitors
so technically...
i could...
and i have like 2 or 3 DVI ports on my GPU
I have a bunch of monitors lying around like that
lol
also you never guessed what programming language that was
let me try and guess
is it ruby?
no
what is it
do you want more code
i mean sure
im not sure
take a few more guesses
am i allowed to use the internet
its probably some language i dont know
so imma look up languages on the internet
yes
elixir
yes
i looked it up on my flickering monitor
good thing i dont have epilepsy
or i would be literally dying right now
lol
I might have epilepsy
maybe
probably not very severely though
the problem is that this is the second time this monitor has done this
and its worse this time
see i thought it might be my GPU
or my HDMI cable
rma?
cuz i use really sketchy HDMI cables
?
Return merchandise authorization
idk what it stands for
yes
like file a return
people use it like
yea
no
RMA is like when you return it to get it repaired or whatever
idk thats what ive seen on the internet
I could do that
is how interested I am in calling HP
well
how interested are you in your monitor not flickering
interested enough that i'll just wait
15 minutes
and it calms down
it did that last time
theres probably some failing decoupling capacitor or something
i could open it
and find the problem
but if its a decoupling capacitor
the chances that i find it are approximately 0
lol
you could RMA it
idk
ill ask my dad tmrw
he bought the monitor
see cyrchdb is getting stuck
because it can't deal with URLs longer than 1000 characters
and then it hit one
and then it got stuck
well
this is the new code
but you can see what was happening before
um
i cant read go
actually I can I tried to learn it
never used it tho
lol that's like me with Rust
lol I use rust
um
go is ok
I can see
its concurrency support is nice
elixir is decent but like it has quirks
have fun
elixir's concurrency is really good
how do you start a thread
in elixir
interesting
how do you signal between threads
message queue
there's a mailbox
you can send and recieve messages
wait
queues or mailboxes
also
or both
mailbox
everything uses processes/threads
how do you do mailboxes
like you open a file
let me look
go has channels
rust does too
do mailboxes
so
with the data
and then match the data
yeah go is pretty much that
except on elixir
you can spawn thousands of processes
with no cost
yeah the same thing with Go
supposedly
since they are not "threads"
they are "goroutines"
elixir/erlang is known for their concurrency
so is go
so is rust
in go to use channels
you do like
ah
which is pretty nice
what is select
it lets a goroutine handle multiple queues
so in this example
this routine handles serial writing
so that you dont have 2 things writing at once
but there are 2 types of writes it can do
so select allows it to choose which one it is going to do based on which one needs to be done
its kind of like waiting for one of the channels to be populated
ah I see
you can just use two channels in rust
you can also specify a default
then if neither are populated
it will not block
I see
I haven't messed that much with messages in concurrent applications
go also compiles really fast
rust compiles really slowly
and go deals nicely with nested anonymous functions and struct definitions
however it has too many types
for my liking
like
are go structs like rust structs
since I like rust structs a lot
i mean
they are just structs
and you can pass them into the Unmarshal function
to turn JSON into struct
like this
rust
serde does this exact thing
in this example
job stores the data
from the json
interesting
so it does the same thing
yeah in go you add those little strings at the end
oh you can do custom fields too
idk how they work
macros
?
like if working is pulled from something else
like "bob" for some reason has the working status
?
look
like
{ "index": 2, "working": false, "status": "broken beyond repair"}
now chagne to
{ "index": 2, "bob": false, "status": "broken beyond repair"}
you can make it interpret that into the former struct
yeah
in go you can do that
that feature is underrated imo
the serialize/deserialize from structs
does python have it
tbh idk
but the thing is
it would not be "pythonic"
ik typescript has this
ah
but it implements it in a fun way
where its not actually making any new structures
or something
idk
i dont use typescript
maybe i should
im currently watching 4 instances of python slowly die
one of them is still half alive
2 of them are dead
one is still dying
please dont ask me why they are dying
i have no clue
try elixir
it might not die
or get a better cpu
anyway
httpie is nice
no im going to rewrite this part of cyrch in go
im rewriting all of cyrch in go
then i can say "written in Go"
like all those go hippies
add blue style accents to cyrch's branding
yes
httpie is good
is that for testing
yes
im using Insomina
no i dont want to use postman or insomnia
calum was using it
i know about both
i used to use insomnia
but ur a terminal frog
and it doesn't work in the terminal
whatever that means
you only exist in terminals
one instance of python is still throwing 200 nested exceptions
excellent
no
if you want
with supabase
I'm using Mnesia
i could try and write it in as few lines of code as possible
thats what im trying to do
i think i could get it under 200
good luck
with log in
it is an API
not a website
emotes?
yes
how do you authenticate
jwt
tokens
how do you issue such tokens
through the api
but how do ppl create profiles
the admin creates them
hmm
what if i made a web UI version of it
then i would not be able to get it under 200 lines
cuz i cant write a website in 200 lines
actually
you can
not true
make it a static site
i can just
minify
lol that doesnt count
what counts then
if i use prettier
human-readable commented code
it can make anything 500 lines
write emotes in 200 lines
?
yes
make it a static site
forget the api part
why does that decrease the number of lines
since there is no code
except the one bash script
that resizes and throws the emotes in folders
its basically emotes
you can
but cy edition
so its not the same
would you like to participate in the cyrch project
no
why
im writing kode rn
and idk what your project entails
you just have to run a web crawler
nah
why not
find someone else
lol
because I said no
wait
repl is a thing
th am i doing
yes
see I knew you would come up with something smart
lol
but it would be fun to have friends doing it
distributed cyrch
distributed jrunner5
that is a thing
except
that i dont even run
i should do that
yeah
you should
since i wrote it
lol
yeah
i will
im building a new server soon
yknow whats funny
its down rn
cuz heroku
itll be back up thursday
when Heroku gives me time back
i could host it on my vultr
since i can host playtools serverless
you could
the problem is
what if the server stops
how do i make it restart
and what if i wanna update it
i have to go and git pull
ssh over the new version
whereas with heroku
i just git push
with a tarball
you can probably write a bash script
that just updates it for you
or
i could put my credit card in heroku
and then they will up me from 500 hours to 1000 hours per month
which is above the 750 hour requirement
for 100% uptime
yes
I want to program this
so I will be disappear now
but you could do all these things
ok
imma keep listening to Valley on spotify
and maybe figure out why tf my python script keeps dying
this is how kode is soposed to look
also I j bought a bunch of rocket lab stock
well
to be rocket lab
ticker vacq
cuz they doin a merger
with rocketlab to go public
cuz they spac
I did that with spce
wich is vergin galatic
and I make many money
if they go vacq
then i got vacq
ha
best stonk adviser
ikr
because they go for stonks
not stocks
see
i have only bought a little gme when that was a thing
this is what wsb does
and sold, made a bit of monee
yuk
you should do day trading
taxes
say no
cuz short term capital gains
+ income tax
= not worth it
Well
Only if ur wallstreet gang
Then u have to day trade
ye
i like to trade large-medium volume of stock within 1-2 years
Yea thats best
so far it work out
so i am happy
lol, all my job money has gone to steam games and stock
i need to get a life
Ah yes
Thats how it goes
Also would ridge be considered an accredited institution by any definition?
false
Ugh
yea
tf
lmao
i j lost a min of my life
reading part of that
it's okay
this is what happens when you search certain things
this website is … interesting
I thought after all this time folding at home, there would b something
I honestly forgot I had a doge wallet
this is satire
i hope
right wing satire is funny
wtf
I think u need alot for u to get a bit
yea I hope
ye, I think ima j buy som e
nvm
act
yea
I really hope
it is
NPC daily says it's satire
Thank god

We believe in the Eternal God; Father, Son and Holy Spirit—the One True God who created all things. We believe there is one God, eternally existent in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

We believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, born of a virgin by the Holy Spirit. Our Lord Jesus Christ is God and Man in one person. He lived a sinless life, performed miracles, and vicariously atoned for sin through His shed blood and death on the cross. We believe in the bodily resurrection, the Ascension into Heaven, and the imminent return of the Lord Jesus Christ.

We believe in the Bible, which is the inspired and infallible Word of God.

We believe in the essential spiritual need for all mankind to personally experience being born again of God and receiving eternal life.

We believe marriage has been established by God. This organization defines "marriage" as the exclusive covenantal union of one man and one woman in which such union is a lifetime commitment. A civil government's sanction of a union will be recognized as a legitimate marriage by this organization only to the extent that it is consistent with the definition of "marriage" found in these articles.

We believe in divine healing through Christ's atonement, appropriated through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.

We believe in the celebration of communion until Christ comes, and a believer's baptism by full immersion.

We believe the person and work of the Holy Spirit with His fruit and gifts abiding in the Church.

We believe regeneration by the Holy Spirit is absolutely essential for the salvation of lost and sinful men.

We believe the Holy Spirit indwells all believers and enables them to live a godly life.

We believe the baptism of the Holy Spirit and the gifts of the Spirit is given to all believers.

We believe eternal life is received by faith. That is, trusting in Jesus Christ alone for salvation and repentance of your sin.

We believe there is unity of all believers in our Lord Jesus Christ.

We believe the true church of the Lord Jesus Christ is made up of all born again believers who have turned from sin and name Jesus Christ as their personal Lord and Savior.

We believe Christ's church, His body, is expressed through local churches under the leadership of apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers.

We believe in the Rapture, the catching away of the Church as described in I Thessalonians 4:16-17.

We believe both the lost and the saved will be resurrected from the dead. They that are lost into the resurrection of eternal damnation, and they that are saved unto the resurrection of eternal life.
my web crawler is downloading every version of firefox
i thought i had already solved this problem
its time to write cyrchbot
the actual crawler
to replace this awful python script that parses html with regex
and dies whenever it feels like it
i have to choose a programming language to write cyrchbot in
i will not write it in python
python has concurrency issues
i could write it in go
i could also try elixir
since ramesh thinks its good
and has good concurrency
oo interesting
elixir is good
also irb is similar to iex
and has similar features
but elixir good for scalability/currency
what is erlang
thing elixir is written in
erlang is just like a "worse' version
so it is supposed to replace erlang
kinda i guess
i mean some people still use erl
i see
erl
perl
very similar names
erlang
perl
not similar
erlang was created by ericcson for use in telecom towers
perlang
2 langs
peroxide
lol
raku
cy
i want to purchase paul
?
i want to purchase paul
who is paul
you know who paul is
paul is my dad
no
paul is
see
look at paul
tfw ramesh tries to make a bad joke
lol
cy is writing a readme

well not really im just using a library to do all of it
who is this
i have no mutual servers with them
but i have mutual friends
they are placing a friend request
Idk
lol
this may be fun
but idk if the tax rate is the same
wait akhil
ur doing filantial niteracy too
yea
lol
i need to do Unit 1
we all do
there is so much annoying stuff to do
im currently working with mapbox a bit
oh
no no no no no
please dont tell me
is this the tutorial
yea
i was doing the tutorial last week
when did you work
and i needed advil
also
after half of it
delete that photo now
if that's urs
it has the last 4 digits of your ssn
dude
its a sim
lol
its not my real taxes
yeah i figured
no one would be that stupid
especially me yea
a official tax sheet is way more complicated then this one
is this for fin lit?
or something?
yup
we never had to do that lol
just flexing about doing it in school
honestly
i would much rather do it in school
but that is no longer an option for me
thank god u dont have to do it
right now im doing fun stuff with mapbox
for rfidgs
imma show it to them tmrw
anyone here want free sat books?
Ah are the tags
Where staff members r?
idk
they just said "tags"
so i called them tags
i think they are multipurpose
i added an offsite version of hx
for things that need more uptime
im using Vercel
i dont like vercel
because they use Amazon
and i dont like Amazon
i prefer cloudflare pages
for this reason
but then cloudflare pages
just like
doesn't work
like
it fails to build a site
that's literally already built
like
theres nothing to build
just deploy it
no.
Internal Error
hahaha Akhil is getting a taste for the pain of taxes
when u get job + hav income from stonks, its like many paper

What vr headset should I get
I will spend at most $500
Isnt the quest 2 the best at the moment?
As a standalone headset
amogus?
I don’t need a stand-alone I alr have a pc
then idk u could probably find like an htc vive pro 2 or something going for 500$
i would recommend a valve index but thats double ur budget
^^ sam talking from cy's computer
amougs
Ah nice
In my opinion
Nope
There r few titles in vr that i feel are worth
But at the moment its not really that great
the amount of freakin grass in this drone
Thats
A solid chunk
im replacing the frame
with one that doesn't really fit
but its fine
cuz the old one didn't entirely fit either
and this new one is supposed to be stronger
and im supposed to be smarter
so its less likely to break
supposed to be
Supposedly
We shall see
If it will survive
yes
theres a broken shielded inductor on my fc
idk what it is for
Thats not good is it
but i see these broken all the time
i mean
the fc still boots up
and the vtx works
although i just realized one of the wires is really frayed
That should be fine
i can put some tape
i think its just the coating
U should get a bunch of heat thingies
The heat covers
The shrink coat
Whatever its called
heatshrink
Yea that one
i could
but i dont think i can put it on
since like
i need to slide it over the wire
and it is connected on both ends
U could cut it in half and try that
But yea
Tape is the same thing
the problem is its such a tiny wire
idk first imma try to get all the grass off the board
Also happy july 4th
yes
happy independence day
I forgot it was today
i cleaned off most of the grass
with this little tiny brush
that came with a Nikon camera i bought a while ago
and some alcohol
DAMMIT I PUT THE FDRHKUEJN BOARD IN BACKWARDS IT TOOK ME 25 MINUTES ASDLFKJHASLKFJHLSKJFH
Nice
ok i think its all back together now
and i dont think o broke anything
that only took
like
an hour and half
its not taking off
it just spins 90 degrees and trips the runaway takeoff protection
and disarms
i think the problem is that the motors are going in the wrong directions
so it is inversely compensating
and dying
yeah they appear to be going the opposite direction betaflight thinks they are going
so imma reverse them in betaflight
and see if it works
yeah it works now
it flies kinda weird tho
and it sounds different
maybe this is what it is supposed to sound like
when its not full of grass
…
One hot second outside
pretty much pure css
except for the mouse motion
2 ppl will be receiving an email tmrw
Oh god
akhil
what do you think of the cube
Uh from my phone it looks not bad
oh its much better on pc
with a mouse
you move the mouse and it turns
I dont/wont have access to a laptop for the next few days
why?
Ah thats cool
Im in boston
ah
ok
have fun in boston
im going to ny today
imma look at the google store
Ooo
Ny is fun
do you want me to look at anything in the google store
Nothing in particular
I mean i wanna know how the pixel 5 is in person
yeah ive tried it at like best buy
but they basically attach a 30 pound weight to it
I saw it havent tried it
Which sucks
so im hoping at the google store like
they have more respect for the products they are selling
at the Microsoft store the devices dont even have the little leashes
Yea
But didnt the store close?
well yes
The one in the mall
but not the one in ny
they left a few open
Yea of course
I was sad
yeah
I went to the mall and it was just
Gone
what is there instead?
i have not been to the mall since they closed lol
Idk
It didnt have anything in it
hmm
sad
are you gonna walk on that path
in boston
i was there a few months ago
theres like this brick line
that you follow
Which path?
i forgot what its called
No clue
i gtg for a moment
ill ask my parents
and then tell you
It's called the freedom trail
Ah i probably walked on that
The last time i came
Ive heard its good
But its expensive
Apparently it has one of the best controllers
My mom just said I could buy one cuz we’re selling stuff
If u want to play vr stuff like half life alex or whatever its called and stuff
Its worth it
But vr imho is not that worth rn
U pay alot of money for not that many games
boston is best
go to the north end for dinner
best Italian food that is better then little italy
go here
this best Italian place
ppl dont speak much english
but it rly good
hey cy
someone
wanna test this
idk if it works over a firewall
but
i want to know
I'm in the city rn
k nvm
Can test when I get home
ill do it on my linode vps
u in hoboken
cuz if so and u haven't ate, there b good Italian place called leos
We parked in Jersey City
And took the ferry to NY
Maybe we could go together
At some point
ye, when my family in Hoboken
Yeah
link bork
cy uses tiktok
lol no it was in a Daily Dose of Internet video
lol that
i have exposed myself to that once in 9th grade
or someone
if you have a moment
please read my email
and tell me if it sounds ok
it sounds okay
but if im gonna be completely honest
i dont think they r gonna give any points back
that's not the point akhil
yea ik
they just need to know
but ur email is good
ok
i will send it later
first imma complete the unit 2 work
nice
rn imma go help out my brother's friend's mom with some computer stuff
and she said shes gonna pay me
so i'd better try and be there on time
please do
just remember
there r 2 sims
Oh god you're doing summer fin lit?
Ik it's some certificate issue
I'm doing an SSD upgrade rn
Again?
This
Ah
Makes sense
I also set up her printer
And her monitors
And her webcam
And we drove out and bought an SSD and a new wireless keyboard and mouse
And now I'm doing the SSD upgrade
ez monee
^
Lol idk what she's gonna pay me
Stonks
mico has sick, but dont have the kobid
Kobid
I always get stick in the summer
Miko hav kobid
and this is the time
mico has vacc, and can taste things
Lol
and no have feavour
I can taste the lack of coronavirus in me
or however u spell
Lol
Macrium is at 66%
lol
WTF is that
System stability at it's finest
uhmmm
what cpu dat got
Core i3 8100
It's not bad
ahhhhhhhhhh
wam?
It's HDD throttled
8gb
ddr3?
Prob
i mean
not bad for a email station
Yeah it's pretty much for email, web, and remote desktop
But the HDD is hella slow
yea,
It's like
So bad
with that new sdd its gonna b blazing speed
ssd
Yeah
i wanna make root beer
Ok it be almost done
Gtg
bye
Michael was in the old how to make everything section of the internet while sick and found videos of root beer
and i wanna make it now
The old screws don't fit the new ssd
So um
Imma just put it in with no screws
There's a nice secure spot for it
lol that took 4 hours
but she paid me $120
so i think its fine
when you have 7 expired certificates and somehow everything is still fine
ah yes
italy is now in the finals
lol do u watch sports
cuz i dont
occasionally
I dont watch sports
but I will google it
not funny
that was me
I said this
actually it is funny
but slightly privacy-invasive
i have no idea who said that
or what it refers to
I said it
or why i care
no as like an outsider
it refers to my college visit at the university of toronto
ah
it would be funny if like
you had two isolated messages "I hate" and "<something here>" and then it just by chance combines them
lol
yes
the option to get rid of any messsages made by me
lol other than that
like to the frontend
nothing
how about
if you want
i can simply download all the messages again
I do want
but then again
and then process them
to include everything but you
so
at least it's private
you could do that
I feel like it would only take a few pipes with a dataframe in Julia
what is this
it's… complicated
let's just say I wanted to "analyse" some messages I got from some people
and then it turned into a very weird
ok but in what way
message ratio and graph project
you know the one
what does it do
I showed the graph to you remember
in comp sci club or something
once
that was messages/day
yeah
is that all it does?
no it also has some message ratio stuff
and then
wdym message ratio
like how much you send vs how much they send
not in words
ok...
since i
text
like
this
wait words could work
yeah I think I used words
not messages
why is this interesting tho
its like
3 lines of python
quantify
it's not that many lines in Julia either
I just wanted to learn julia
also it has a feature to combine
message histories across different platforms
into one html file
so you can read your entire chat history with this person
interesting
yes
it is meaningful to me
now I must add hangouts support since I used that for a long time
for um
reasons
lol
I must depart now though
so bye
bye
Oooo
interesting
i like joe biden
he cares about the same issues i care about
like right to repair
Yea
and producing lithium batteries and solar panels in the US
If it goes through
Imma be intrested to see how hospitals and farmers respond
Those r the most intresting
Mechanics as well
yeah
i have completed about 30% filantial niteracy work
yeah I'll also like it
apparently the UK law, according to reddit, had right-to-repair for everything but phones and computers
but it's reddit so idk anything
it was a headline
Yea believe so
egg-celent
Phones and computers r kinda low on that list imo
They dont really need it compared to other stuff
hi im a farmer
i lost half my yield
bc my tractor broke
and i had to send it to john deere
and john deere took too long to fix it
hi im a person
Wasnt it not too long
I lost my life chat history with my wife
hi im dead
But how expensive it was
because my phone broke
bc my ventilator broke
and apple wiped all the data from my iphone
Aww heck yea
and im devastated
that was the only place I had pictures of my newborn baby
also it had important stuff for the divorce proceedings
but before my phone was wiped
the repair guy downloaded my sex photos
Apple: “shouldve used icloud”
and posted them online
and I used signal so I can't get them back
since I have the one wife in a million that would use signal
and not imessage
Haha
lol
lol i want that wife
Well itll be interesting to see how it goes
ramesh has his future planned out
yeah you think
i need to do financial literacy
if i dont do it
I shall now write the Hangouts module of my message analyser
go do that
and dont talk to me
for another 4 hours
How
censorship is not nice cy
unless I missed the how getting deleted
i was fixing computers for 4 hours
That was me deleting it
haha
Still
I finished everything yesterday
Just had to make a resume
THERES LIKE 6 FFERWEDAS ASSIGNMENTS
Yup
i have not done the resume yet
or the sim
Make sure u get those done
i have 3.5 hours
so
As well as ur essay response
what essay response
WHAT
The reflective
U need an essay answer
So like 2-4 paragraphs
oh that's trivial
chapter 10
5/5
Bruh
I did a page for that
Akhil
please understnad
they dont check
a
single
thing
Yea im fully aware
Well
No
i literally got a 90% on the sim
and they gave me 100%
My goals thing
They gave me a 17
Out of 20
Cause i forgot stuff
lol they gave me a 0
Nice one
they will be recieving an email
probably tmrw
from me
Yea u should send that
Thats kinda important
i mean i can still get an A
as long as i do everything else
9 units
50% off on one unit
cough
Where do u see grades?
classroom>classwork>view your work
you can discuss this with me after i finish my work or 11:59 PM passes
hopefully the former
goodbye
Adios
GIVE ME 6000 MEALS IM HUNGRY
I AM DONE WITH THE SIM
MY FREAKING THUMB
OMG
You're doing summer fin lit
Oof
lol yes
and i swear
How long per day?
if this gives me arthritis
1-3 hours?
Yeah
idk
It's a grind
its like several hours
but i do it all in one go
im not done yet
i still have the reflective component
I spent Up to 3 hours every day 7 days a week on fin lit
Oof
smh
Try to spread it out
Don't cram
idk
ill just assembly line it

They never went over the estimate for me
FOR TWO AND A HALF FREAKING YEARS
Yep
I want to know how in the world this is a "swear word"
this is in a github swear word blocklist repo
RAMESH is on topic
yeah I am
i am going to finish my reflective component
And why does Ramesh autocorrect to RAMESH
Yeah gl
And cy do some every day don't cram
My personal suggestion
I did it last year
Pain
But 1-3 hours per day every day will help you set a routine
Just a steady grind
im not working on this for 1-3 hours every day
id rather rush it all in one night
in like 4-5 hours
Oh
Well we're different ppl
4-5 hours of focused rushing financial literacy assignments
lol you probably actually try
I like to have a routine
Oh no
That's the thing
i basically do the minimum
I do as little as I can
Yeah same
So I do more 2 hours than 3
And also I try to find some fun in it
idk ive been working on this since like 6pm
So I do some every day
idk
Ah
Idk
i think imma alternate
If it works!
1 day of summer reading
1 day of financial lit
Or do weekdays
Summer reading isn't too bad
idk i have trouble with it
Just do 30 min every day
That's what I try to do
It eorks
Works
i was gonna do that but then like
somehow it just doesn't happen
idk
Look
1-3 hours of fin lit and 30 min of reading
That's like your morning
lol i wake up at 11
Assuming you wake up at 8 or 9
And then you have the rest of the day to do whatever
Oh
Nvm then
ideally I work until around 2 or 3 AM
Well then that's your late night grind
so ideally i do the financial lit one day before its due
yeah
Lol
its like math practice
sometimes
i just like
do math practice
K gl and have fun!
until 1 or 2 am
Imma sleep hehehee
Oof
lol gn
imma stay up
unless my headache from this gets worse
and i have to go to bed
Oof
Imma sleep gn
gn
*sigh
done
Cy sighs
h i  i ' m  k e v i n  p o w e l l
WAIT VERCEL IS POWERED BY VERCEL
OMGGGG
AND THEY WROTE IT IN NEXT.JS
U forgot
To add an MIT license to the licenses
what is the MIT license?
Anybody can use modify and stuff
thats 1:3
anyone can do anything
No ik that
But u need to license ur licenses
thats in the readme
Do it
nah
maybe later
im watching this guy
hes investigating the cause of champlain tower south collapse
Thats intresting
Im also in the same boat as cy tmrw
with regards to what
filantial niteracy?
Financial lit stuff all in one day
Yup
oh my god its like
3 sims
Actually 6 hours
With no internet
With no sleep
Cause i am sleeping
On the floor
wdym
i meant
this
wdym
No internet
I have no wifi
i dont understand de quoi tu parle
so you mean
basically
where you are
theres no wifi
and no bed
Yes
ok wait how does that relate to financial literacy
Nothing really
I need wifi to do financial literacy
i mean...
I need sleep to not die
also where are you
that there is no bed
or wifi
My new house
ohhh
They has no furniture
ok you wanna hear a funny story
And wifi get installed on the 9th
Sure
we know these people
my brother's friend's family
ok so they moved
right
and the first day
they moved in
and that night
like
they hadnt realized
the house they moved into
had no (0) ceiling lights
like
none whatsoever
Haha
Ha…..
Ha
so they had to like
they had like 1 or 2 plug in lamps
Guess what cy
what
I dont have ceiling lights
lol
Granted its only in the bedrooms
So i can get em installed
But is dark
yea
lol if you want u can come over to my house
and we could do financial lit together
tmrw
that would be fun
Ah i prob wont have time
Movers come tmrw
well if you have time lemme know
Yea i will
we should "work together" on some of this financial lit stuff
ik alankar's doing it too
so i might call him and
you wanna call and work together on financial lit
uh i cant really
im using a hotspot for internet
so its slow as heck
ah ok
i finished financial lit
for today
and i have a freaking headache
nice one
i have like 3 more things
i did it with alankar
he like
gave me all the answers
smart
yea
i gotta do that cancer vacation planning thing
oh that
yea that
lol its like
really annoying
if you need moral support
feel free to call me
yea i might need it
actually
i can prob get on discord now
ok
cy
No it's not
Cy is never broken
Never underestimate a Cy
it is broken
finish a test
and then you will find it will load the exact same thing again
nvm it fixed itself
???
Lol
I am not at home
I think it was because I was two spaces ahead
so idk
So I can't test stuff
k
If you find a problem please make a GitHub issue
there's a github
TIL
okay I will do that
What does this mean
today I learned
your licenses are nonfree btw
Ik
Not all of them
1:1 is
yeah I know
If you want you can add a GitHub link to the site and make a PR
I need to learn more about PRs
def made for a reason
also im doing ap personal finance instead of fin lit
over the summer
cuz I was gonna do it
but then stevens precollege program rolled around
so I was like, well we dont hav da time for de tests
ap personal finance time
Are you guarenteed into the course?
lol I hope
if not I will j take it senior year
As an elective?
Ah that's smart
is this the point where I flex on you all for taking it in person the first semester of 10th grade
so I literally don't have to deal with any of this lol haha funny
I mean ap econ also counts
wait
Until the 2021-2022 school year
After that no
ye I am the last one
aw
that's sad
quite the unfortunate thing
i mean, i am not allowed to touch machines but what about the ones that you make
test 1, mixed results
it burned for a bit
but then did not
so i need a better ignition system
interesting
no thrust
but
3d printed engines can hold up to some heat of combustion
cuz like that part that is kinda dying was ment to kinda die
that is interesting
i thought it would melt
like the whole thing
i did a mico recipie
wich has insulator
of fire scelent thing
in the middle
so it no melto
cool
and the part with no scelent
no melt
but
mico math check out
cuz i got some combustion
this is what happens when u change ur windows font
lol
remember this
hmm
im not so sure about netlifyCMS
its gonna cause some platform lockin
Intresting
Welp i just got internet
So we back in business
👍
im currently looking up tutorials on how to use netlifycms with vercel
so I can see how hard it is
not easy
you have to like
run a git gateway
and some auth thing
and a lot of the tutorials say to use their software or plugins
which only work with vercel
so that doesn't help
so...
umm...
idk its not the end of the world ill just use netlify
the only reason I dont wanna use netlify is that they have limits
on transfer
and build minutes
and I think vercel builds faster
but
now that I think about it
i could technically just host my site on both netlify and vercel
and use the netlify one for netlifycms
netlifycms is too finnicky
and the UI is weird
i think ill just be my own cms for now
Gatsby is driving me nuts
i thought i was done with this react nonsense
i think imma just use sveltekit
why is the most generic thing so complicated
as far as I understand sveltekit has a plugin for prerendering
and it works
when you define a variable BUT NO ITS NOT ACTUALLY A VARIABLE
someone please help the sass compiler
Dont u need like ${background} or something
didn't need it in a different file
there.
you can no longer complain about my blog.
do you think we should pull out of afghanistan
idk
im working on my blog
my favorite thing about Gatsby is when the development server gives a different result from the production build
like
the development build will work perfectly
but when you build
the build will literally appear, then self destruct within about 250ms
because the ssr worked, but the hydration failed
so your user sees your site for a split second
then it all disappears
and when you go to the console to see the error
its some minified crap
this is quantum computing
we are 2 themes at once
Gatsby's static rendering is broken
its funny cuz that's literally the point of gatsby
welp
lets just disable it for this page
yawn
netlify takes about 2x as long to build compared to vercel
and from my 1 day of experience
it completely fails about 10% of the time
although that's probably a me issue
dude the one thing that joe bidome did right
Cool
Time to see what happens
I spend money
got imessage working on the surface hackintosh
cool
Italy won
How
What is this turn of events
Whats that?
oh youll see
its related to this
Ah i see
this should only take me a little less than 2 hours
im doing it on the Wikipedia page for "Computer"
Yea i can imagine itll take a while to record each word
well ive automated it pretty good
True
just press space
say the word
press space
and another one comes up
and repeat
theres a python flask server dealing with actually logging and organizing the audio data
so I must go
and continue this process
*sigh
Nice
Have fun
Hahaha
Good luck saying that
lol
I need to get authelia to work
go do that
Yes
imma try and pronounce this
But to do that i need to set up recursive dns with pihole
Which is a pain
On top of a pain
Gl
I swear imma become like that guy who knows how to pronounce everything
Oh yea
aisujdfp😰iasdfp
U should add a thing
Where it adds the pronounication
meh
no one ever uses that word
ill just try pronouncing it
1/6 of the way there
Nice one
1/3 of the way there
and I swear
i hasn't given me the word "of"
Surprising
give me a sentence
I like pie, and pie likes me
doesn't have i
?
it doesn't have the word "i"
I
something it can say:
army force involving bsd port babbage central
Ah the spacing between the words is weird
Cause ur speed of speaking varies
yeah
Which one looks better
the second one
Its nice looking
But its kinda dramatic
for ur hash compression
also dude this is sick
def the second
hmm
thanks for the input
in that case
hows that?
bruh
a little too overdone
thats sick
false
its perfect
yea i have to tone it a bit down
hmm
im trying to make a profile that works for everything
did u take these
yea
where u at
they were when I was at maine like a week ago
dude I regonised that lighthouse and was thinking that u were in maine
yup i was at that one
cuz like i went to maine 2 years ago for spring break
and it was many fun
wait no for summer vacation
yea but it was fcking cold
rly
oh yea
when i went it was freezing
and raining
yuk
if it was nice u should have gone kayacking
yea i wanted to
it is many fun cuz there are a buncha small islands along the cost
and u kayack to them
and can fish
yup i visited one of them
its one of the popular ones
forget what its called
Mei-Li typed in her bank’s website address as usual, but when it came up, the website looked different. She supposed the bank must have redesigned its website. She typed in her username and password, but instead of bringing up her account, a new web page came up. It told Mei-Li all her money would be lost unless she typed in her Social Security number, her mother’s maiden name, and her date of birth. No way!
interesting
edge now has a feature that allows you to force https
brain bork
lol rainbow attack
why is it called a rainbow table lol
🇻🇳
Yes
ooooo this is gonna b fun
i will tell u da problems and how to fix
Cool
it will take about a week
Ok
Can I as well
Sure
as long as you dont do anything unethical
Okay
btw dont ddos codetools
you can try to hack its security
but
dont like
spam create accounts or stuff
the db does not have limits set yet
you can ddos the api if you want tho
as long as ur not making any database entries in the process
lol google sheets running perfectly fine in IE9 on windows vista
That is actually kinda intresting
This shouldnt be working
This only works on devices that have a the fancy neural chip
Thats the only way it can find text in an image/ocr
ie8 says no
can I do sql attacks
but on the main database
?
ima take that as a yes
i mean
you can't cuz theres no sql
MongoDB is NoSQL
fuk
i should do recherch
lol
on cy site
lol
ima do plan b
have you been working on this within the past half hour?
cuz um
there have been like 0 requests to the server
ie says no
ima do siem intrusion
no
cuz i am taking class
rn
ok
here is something u should look into
actually
imma not say
?
the website is running in an iframe
?
Oh
yea which means people can clickjack it which isnt good
just set some x-frame-options header
What is clickjack
Uh when people use invisible iframes and stuff to get info
interesting
i should try and fix that
hi and welcome to on-timeness literacy
on-timeless niteracy
lol cy is failing bc he dont do his work on time
Oops
This is why do work early!!!!
yes
but still
they r kinda overkill with the no late work
can you send me financial lit stuff
Um
Not at the moment i cannot
wait also akhil
(how) are you studying for the assessment tmrw
I am not
interesting
so you dont think its neccesary
is it open notes?
The content is pretty self explanatory
Well
Technically no
Yea
So its open notes
Just print out some stuff to stay offline
but then it looks weird on ur camera
cuz ur looking down
Well there r
80+ kids
The odds that they r looking at u
Is very low
believe me they can tell
my mom is a teacher
also they probably record it
i think imma have the quizlets and other materials open on my screen
also why not
are you still doing it
im out
so its kinda difficult
ok
I dont get this one
True I agree. I did it last year lol
Idk I just bsed it
Make stuff up within reason
lol
ill look it up on the innernet
Ink
Printer cost
Domain maintenance price
is that deductible?
I have no clue
I forgot
So just make stuff up within reason
lol
buisnuess expences
like travel costs
Yeah basically
What
Oh right
That's smart!
are those deductible tho
some meteral costs
Idk
yes
I just put material costs
OH WAIT
Like ink and printer and domains
THE QUESTION IMPLIES
THAT ALL BUSINESS EXPENSES
ARE DEDUCTIBLE
yea
Idk lol
whoops
Too long ago
One year
Flex
lol

At the state level, taxes primarily go to education and healthcare. A lot of this is at the K-12 level, as they fund the public schools in their entirety (except for summer financial literacy which is an extra $300 oops). More than $316 billion dollars goes to public schools each year (clearly none of which was able to be spent on improving the summer financial literary course).
yes
u should include it
u mean communism
to illigal immagrents and drug addicts
I dun like it when ppl act on my behaf
also why is the icon a pulse
this gets me worried
Tf is this?

dedadated wam
yeah
a while ago
huh
cause it wont let me
yeah um
they may have removed it
hold on
i believe they did
cause the option is not there
what worries me a little
is that like
there is literally no option
at all
even for me
so its permanently on for me
yea its annoying
so if i ever have to use a school chromebook
without my phone on me
im pretty much screwed
i accidentally had my student id on a github project
lol
you know your student ID is unaccidentally in the URL of genesis
yea
thats what happened
lol
its gone now but still
why tf is it in clear text
working on my blog
adding background images
imma also add cover videos
oh nice
so i can feature a YouTube video
before the whole article
im still pissed off why its just there in genesis
CUZ ITS YOUR STUDENT ID
ITS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE UR PASSWORD
tell that to the school
lol we should
we should get together
and tell the school
but like
literally no one cares
but like
5 ppl
you, me, and 3 other random ppl
true
but i still want 2fa
that much they should give us
tbh im fine with no 2fa
as long as i can change my password
true
idk it is my google account for school so idrc that much
but imma go through a security purge and make new passwords
from youtube
theres 4h
if u wanna join
oo
I join
kool
u wanna join 4h
theres like just michael
does anyone here want free music software
bitwig studio 4.0
im upping my illegal web crawling game
imma do a fun project
you paste a link to any site with song lyrics on it
and the software will scrape the lyrics from the page
using AI
the idea is you can do this for any page
or any service
and in principle be able to do this for any type of data you are trying to scrape
yes
like that
Easy one to start
but first I have to figure out how to use AI
i just connected a GPU to my google colab instance
and its like
5x faster
What do you use google colab for
im using it to run the google tensorflow examples
someone gimme a list of songs
like 10-20
ideally more popular songs
ok so i have now successfully generated about 20k strings that are either part of song lyrics or not part of song lyrics
TF is happening in europe
this building is burning and flooding at the same freakin time
tensorflow doesn't support AMD gpus
which is sad
because
i have an amd gpu
and im impatient
and keras is taking forever to train
lol i wonder why *cough 17.7k samples
ROCm
?
ROCm is worse cuda for amd
interesting
my model has 90% accuracy
which is kinda trash
lol kinda like grades in basking ridge
my ai sorta works
it misses about half the lyrics
but
but this
lol
see my ai never picks up anything that is not a lyric
so as long as it finds something close to the first lyric
which is almost always does
and something close to the last lyric
which is kinda does
i can just pull everything in between
ok actually i retrained it with randomized data
and its like
way better this time
gimme a song
or the link to the lyrics of said song
on any website
uh
sure
i need the link to the lyrics
i could just google it
but like
knowing you
there are no lyrics
um
listen to it for a second
uh
how about
"wake me up" by avicii
ok lemme try that
raw lyric snippet
if i implemented that thing from before
[Verse 1]
Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me

[Chorus]
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know﻿ I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know ﻿I was lost

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
I hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game﻿ made for everyone
And love is the prize

[Chorus]
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know﻿ I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost

[Outro]
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
if i was smart about implementing it
so generally it works
this is by far the most overengineered web scraper i have ever made
but i have to say
it works
the only thing is its not one nice program
its 3 programs right now
the first is to google search the link to the song lyrics, written in python
the second is to scrape the page with puppeteer, written in nodejs
the third to run the keras model, written in python
the current issue with this whole thing is that keras only works in python
and puppeteer only works in nodejs
*yawn
im going to bed
Dude
U should go to bed way earlier
I mean I go to bed around 11-12
just got back from the beach
its machine learning time
I am a shepord for children cuz I am helping run a camp for deb8
they are funny, but it is j all Asian kids
lol
how is it?
a daycare for asians
horrable
What teacher did u get?
I am with dr b
ah
he likes me tho
yea thats good
i am with gia
it is funny tho
oh u have a partner
yea
so it is me gia and dr b
ik somebody who got norris and is by himself
so he gets to chill with him
Norris is not here rn
i wish he was
cuz he is my deb8 coach
norris is great
ye
i hope i have him for ap gov next year
cuz that means when i go away from deb8 i dont get wrecked
same
i am eating lunch rn, and the children are yelling
it is the big sad
rnt they like 9th graders?
i regret doing this
how bad could a bunch of 9th graders be?
yea + middle school to 5th grade
oh
oh no
yea
oh no no no
rf needed money
i feel bad for u
yea
so i have to handel real children
yea
and they are scary
r u getting paid?
u better be
nope
i was forced
cuz i am tech secratary
…
ah
this is child labour
it is
i have 4.5 more days of this
it is kinda funny to
tho
have fun
there is this one kid that farts alot
and has some kind of autism
so he yells and farts
and as one of our duties we have to take kids to the bathroom
…
thank god
so i was warned by dr b not to take him to the bathroom as he pulls his pants all the way down
i am not in debate
yes
if dr b hated me he would not have told me
as I almost had to take him
but he gave that responcability to someone else
dude
i am at school and my proxy bork
thats not good
so i cant use discord
that sucks
sadness
did they block the port?
no, my pi died
ah
cuz it was running proxy for like 3 months straight
rip
use a vpn
nah proxy cool
also i got docker to work
but it wont do discord
while eating lunch
proxies only do http as far as I know
proxy did discord for me
i had a secure proxy
and i was able to run discord
well but did the wss connection actually work
cuz you can run discord
but the wss wont work
idk
i was able to send and receve messages
interesting
so prob
that's my wireguard config
if u want it
when I do proxy thing ima add it
much thx
yw
for now ima do remote desktop
and that is working fine
lol
yea
realvnc to the rescue
exactly
i gtg take care of children
bye
have fun
i am saying my prayers
ahsdfjalsdfkhalsdkfjah keras is not working
its just hanging
cy added contextual reasoning to his ai web scraper
it now examines not only the current line, but also the previous line and the next line
which appears to have improved overall accuracy from 95% to about 99%
but has reduced false negatives from about 55% to about 25%
hi my name is tensorflow
i can make cool text vectorization based models
AND I CANT FREAKING SAVE THEM
kajhsd;lkjhfal;sdkjfhlakjsdhf
i need to install the "nightly" version
and it wont install
aasdasfsdfasdfaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
dealing with tensorflow feels like trying to install custom roms on an AT&T locked phone
its not completely impossible
but...
would you like to know what line caused that error?
I want to use wsl
but wsl wont load
it downright refuses
docker?
requires wsl
a vm?
im not using a vm
actual linux?
*yawn
when pip wont uninstall ur modules
Using python? 😃😃😃😃
yes
python is usually not this bad
oops uninstalled pip
um
*cough
GODDAMIT
IT DOESNT SUPPORT PYTHON 3.9
AL:KDFJHALSKJDFHLAKSJDHLASKJDHLAKSJDH
THATS WHY ITS NOT WORKING
tensorflow and I are having some tension
its ok
we can work this out
alrighty take 8 or whatever
lol nvm
there will be no tensorflow js
tensorflow is crap
its so inconsistent
but on the bright side
pyppeteer appears to be working
hi my name is tensorflow
saving a model does not always do the same thing
sometimes...
i will just save a bunch of corrupted nonsense
other times...
ill save just fine
*yawn
lol and I thought I was up late
i need to clean my keyboard
i think imma do that
i have to remove all the keys
the documentation is in chinese
I DID NOT ASK FOR THE DOCUMENTATION TO BE IN CHINESE
ohmygod why is this so difficult
I GOT COPILOT
Oh cool
Looks pretty good
Was that what u were gonna type?
Welcome to ai
tbh im not sure
but the rest of the lines were
this is 100% what i am aiming to accomplish with this function
thanks copilot :)
imagine taking 12 seconds to reach a 30 second timeout after 60 seconds
huh
so you can't run a headless chromium rendering runtime and a tensorflow machine learning model on 256mb of ram in a docker container
its actually not bad this copilot thing
in certain cases
ok this is actually pretty cool
whats fun is that it even understands what is a client error and what is a server error
AP scores are out
Dude
I bs’d an entire subjects ap test
Like went in without knowing anything
Took the test
Wrote random stuff
Chose random mc
Got a 5
The one i try on i score less on
What scores did u gets
On apush
4
So pretty good
ah I got a 4 too
on ap sem
yea it wasnt bad
now i gotta do fin lit
apparently tho if you look at the percentages
was the curve massive?
idk
for ap sem 11% of ppl get 5
about the same for US history
wait
no that's an unofficial website
on the official website
6.4% of ppl get a 5 on ap sem
13% of ppl get a 5 on ap us
and lol
yea it was low this year
25% of ppl get 5 on apcs
well that doesnt really matter
those r nation wide statistics
im more curious about ridge as a whole
how do you find local statistics
u cant
only ap teachers have that information
interesting
wait
i wanna see the nation stats on aphug
the percentage must be very high
Sherice got a 5 in sem
trevor packer said that
every score's performance went down
except hug
hug people improved on and did better
haha
also anyone here dont ask what I got I absolutely inted the entire AP thing
lol did cy get a 5 in comp sci
u better hav
no I 1200% did not get a 5 in comp sci
really
fuck
i got a 5
then I failed
lol
25% of ppl do
nationally
i thought u were serious
i haven't checked my skores
checkem
cuz i am at the deb8 camp
for liitle kids
on cell phone
I dont trust fone sekurity
ima b home in in hour anyways
so I will check then
ok
i am nervous
cuz i need a 5
i mean i could still get a 4 an b fine
but like
5 = best
cuz ap scores are now worth more
cuz collages r taking away the sat
i got a 4 in sem
is that actually true
should i intern at replit
if they have any positions open and they accept high schoolers sure
its a good experience
you have to do this whole complicated thing
im trying to find companies i could intern at
i think they do
the hell
ohmygod since when is it ok to assign FOUR FREAKING SIMULATORS for one assignment
like
i get it was assigned a little while ago
smh
idk
idk
i finished em all
was pretty quick
im on #2
uh oh
wherd all the banks go
did they all fail?
were they FDIC insured?
windows 356 is a thing
its basically stadia
but for windows
you can get cloud vms
and stream them to any device
i could see this being kinda interesting
like
if you need to do some video editing
but u have a crappy laptop from 5 years ago
you can just provision a vm with a fancy cpu and gpu
do ur video editing
and then terminate the vm
when ur done
I got 5 on apcs exam, I forgot to tell last night
Knife transparent?
Hmm?
No its just a shiny metal one
The way its reflecting tho is crazy cool
yea
i bought 2 amzn for financial lit
imma also buy some spotify
dunno why
should i buy more lithium americas
I too got a 5
Yes I have many of that stock
Buy VACQ
And sedg
And spce
Among others
when google's free cloud service is 6x faster than ur pc
lol actually more like 10x
Huh
yeah
colab
they giv free gpu
Well yea if ur using tensorflow and collab
Itll work nicer
the thing is
i wanna train models for long time
and im pretty sure colab has time limits
i have a gpu
but its amd
and i dont wanna try and use amd's thing
Um i think it does but u can like script start and stop it mabye
Yes idk
I wanna train a chatbot/teach it english
i also "have" a gtx 1050ti
that would be cool
wanna work on it with me?
Why have in quotations
Um sure
its on my family computer
Eh just snag it
my brother will get mad
Make him not mad
lol
he literally watches YouTube and plays Minecraft and brawl stars
and among us sometimes
like
just use the iGPU
Yea that would be more than enough
Idk i have a gtx 710 so its outdated
But i can run models for like weeks at a time
tbh
my cpu would probably be better than a gtx 710
Probably
My cpu would be better than a gtx 710
But u need a gpu sometimes
i dont think so
Well it depends on which cpus
My i7 idk mabye
My xeons probably
i think tensorflow works cpu only
but like
it just gets hella slow
Hmm
Idk but i am gonna try training a bot to speak english
it trained all 150 epochs in like 90 seconds
yeah that
um
Thats pretty good
rn im training a model
and like
1 epoch is taking 4 minutes
im on 3 of 20
Thats not terrible
not that terrible, but like
for something usable
you need like 50-100 epochs
probably
Itll be done in like 40 minutes or so
Yea
ofc this is not training on text messages
this is training on Shakespeare
Yea
hey you know we actually have a lot of training data for a chat bot
..
Yea
this would be an interesting project
we could make a telegram bot
that like
actually talks
Yup
That would be cool
Ideally its an api
have u ever tried machine learning
I used to use it
for what
Then i stopped cause it pissed me off
lol
um
i can relate
Um the simple example projects
Like cats vs dogs
yeah
i did some ml for my dad
that was the first thing i did
we classified images of fiber speckle patterns
now im doing more nlp
natural language processing
so the ai-lyrics/AnyLyrics thing
Yup ik
I wanted to use nltk for some discord bot
what is tk
But u had to define grammar rules
And i didnt want to do that
the nlp Shakespeare example im running rn is character based
Natural language toolkit
it doesnt even have to be in english
it learns english
my model is currently learning Shakespearean english
what is that
is that like tensorflow?
Not really
It works with language processing
interesting
Its statistics based
website?
Uh its a library
U can just look it up
interesting
it would be more fun probably tho to make a model that uses machine learning
with tensorflow
Yeah
hmm
Yea ill prob start once i get my servers back up and stuff
I havent unpacked my boxes still
lol
we could start on my computer
oh no the epochs are getting longer
i m not sure i m not hungry
