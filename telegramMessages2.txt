oos
F
F
F‚•πgod damn it‚•πagain
amazon/newegg are better
since they dont crash‚•πnono its cuz i didnt add payment information
and it defaulted to paypal‚•π"i told you so"
lol‚•πI CANT CHANGE IT WTF
HOW DO YOU CHANGE PAYMENT METHOD‚•πask the server tbh
ramesh aint really trying for much
the next crazy thing im going to pull is in february probably with the 6000 series
6700xt probably
make sure you figure out how to do it for 
* amazon
* antonline
* newegg
* bestbuy
* asus
* zotac (insert zotac meme)

<I can't think of any other retailers>
just like check em all off‚•πzotac is paypal only‚•πit wont happen again if youre ready
bruh
ur kidding‚•πyeah its wack af
newegg‚•πI can help you on newegg
i did it there already‚•πi already did newegg
thats why i wrote newegg
as a checklist thing‚•πhmm amazon
u say 17th
ups say somethging else
lol cool‚•πBB‚•πyes‚•πim not doing antonline or asus or zotac‚•πnewegg is worst imo
lol
is antonline too sketch for u‚•πit still has cards tho
yeah antonline is SKETCH AS‚•πwhere
did they FUD into thinking antonline is sketch‚•πnono‚•πpeople are actually getting stuff‚•πit was my own opinion‚•πlol‚•πit just looks a bit sketch‚•πit was sketchy but honestly I would do it
it feels less skethcy after seeing people having success there‚•πnahnah
plus neither of my parents know of it
sooooo
LMAO‚•πmy dad heard of it after he looked ryzen 5000
so
lmao
there a chance it comes tomorrow?‚•πmaybe idk
wouldnt count on it tho‚•πyeah idc i wont have anything ready tomorrow
i have to use
this brand psu
to test my stuff
sentey is very sketchy
errr
i can buy it
im this close to buying a kraken x52
should I do it‚•πX53 or 52
53 okay
Depends on ur case
And if the look fits it‚•πx53 is newer
idk about those thermaltake fans tho
they are really cheap though
i donnit
i bought a kraken x53‚•πis the ryzen 9 3900x a bad idea?
its $400 at microcenter‚•πyes‚•πhow so‚•π5800x has higher single core
better for gaming
the 3900x gets 213 fps, the 5800x gets 373‚•πoh thats true‚•πaaand 5600x drop happened‚•πcouldnt add to cart
like‚•πdid you buy now
or add to cart‚•πthe button just wouldnt work
both‚•πF
would you have settled for it if you had gotten it‚•πoh yeah
for sure‚•πapparently amazon is drop shipping cpus from amd or something
honestly try snail monitor
it might be faster
again I can help you get full acecss to snail
im legitimately worried this will happen to me concerning my 5900x since it is so high demand‚•πi was the first F‚•πlol
ahhhhhh
do you have your aio already‚•πNag
Nah‚•πwell we'll see how good this kraken is
also I investigated temp issues
that's for the kraken aio software which is pointless for me‚•πis that urs?
if so pog‚•πno
u think
i got a 3080‚•πlmao‚•πOO UPS MOVING
i love how it starts on 11/11/2020 like ups doesn't know what thy're doing‚•πNICE‚•πit's gonna happen soon
my cooler also shipped lol‚•π4 hour drive
from VA to NJ‚•πLOL no
this is strange tho
amazon also shipped my coolers via ups‚•πnevermind 7 hours
i put in somerset
but it defaulted to somerset maryland‚•πlol
ughh do you know how bad the bottleneck will be
5900x rx580‚•πwhat tasks?
gaming?
a lot‚•πyeah exactly‚•πotherwise not much‚•πand im not getting a 3080‚•πrip
rx 6800xt?‚•π6700 in february probs‚•πohhhh
should be nice hopefully‚•πyeah like the 6900xt will probably go oos in 2 seconds‚•πsame with 6800xt‚•πyou know apparently it took 6 months to get regular 3950x or 3900x stock
WTH is this screenshot‚•π$1000‚•πno
look at the SCREENSHOT‚•πjust get an intel at that point
yeye‚•πhow tf does he buy
a 5900x‚•πye ik‚•πi feel like it's inspect elemented‚•πcould be‚•πpeople are bad like this smh
Did you get that zotac drop‚•πno cuz paypal‚•πIm assuming you didnt try the 5950x drop yeh
Since
Monies‚•πi dont need 16 god damn cores
$800
a bit too much for me‚•πhow much is it supposed to be‚•π$800‚•πuhhh‚•πmsrp is $700 for rtx 3080‚•πhow much are the cheaper 3080s
oh
ah i see‚•πF‚•πso how gosh darn incredibly lucky am I

on everything‚•πwrong her‚•πleilani‚•πwho is that‚•πthe one
who
you
stand next to all the time‚•πi do not
as a matter of fact
i dont even know who that is‚•πanyway back to my benchmark
i want my benchmark
to run
on all cpus‚•πsilverbench‚•πcuz
i wanna benchmark
my ESP8266‚•πwhat a strange correlation indeed‚•πah yes‚•πand compare it
to my actual computers
and like my raspberry pi‚•πy?‚•πTensillica Xtensa‚•πWhat is that?
ESP8266
What is that‚•πCy i give u the honors‚•πhahah
5900x go brrr‚•πi wanna know‚•π90 fricken k‚•πhow much performance it has‚•πmore than your cpu‚•πso i must test it
but i want numbers that i can relate
to my other chips
so
i need a universal benchmark‚•π1
wait‚•πIs it 1 or 9?‚•πPEMDAS‚•π1‚•πI think it‚Äôs 1 too
P
E
MD
AS‚•πapparently it can do 13 mbps
serving data
which is not bad
i wonder
if
it could render webpages‚•πah right thats the correct way to write it‚•πokay it loaded the chat history
very
fast
so I am surprised‚•πWhen you get a 75% on a precalc test üò≥üò≥üò≥üò≥üò≥‚•πF‚•πA-

the one who you stand next to all the time‚•πyou will always get a response‚•πNice‚•πimma do my homework‚•πI would recommend you stop
While that is true, you don't have to remind me of it
I do not want to be reminded of me
Since I already know myself‚•πits not for you, ramesh
just never mention Her again, and it wont appear‚•πUh oh its broken‚•πI did not?
I said "Samantha"‚•πleilani
the one who you stand next to all the time‚•πHer‚•πThat is not the same.
Fortunately‚•π*sigh‚•πOr I would be a really terrorized person‚•πwhat is this make command for‚•πfor
making omega
j4 is four threads‚•πyea ik that
what is Omega username?‚•πtry and see heh‚•πi will later‚•πor try cy‚•πi have to first install epsilon sdk first‚•πyou have to get past chapter 29 really‚•πah
that
alright‚•πi wanna modify epsilon‚•πdid samantha get a numworks‚•πdid u also do this make command and the theme command in the same line?‚•πyes‚•πalrighty‚•πakhil‚•πi should have done -j12‚•πik why it's not working‚•πsince i have 12 theads‚•πi thought it was cores not threads‚•πakhil
are you
having problems‚•πwanna have a benchmark
because you're not using linux akhil‚•πwhat no
u can use mac first off‚•πlinux easier‚•πsecond i have not even tried
its legit just git and make commands
and the sdk is in homebrew‚•πokay cy let's have a test‚•πtest what‚•πchange the j to whatever you want‚•πi need to boot into Linux for that
which i dont wanna do‚•πwhy would u want to change the j value?‚•πfaster‚•πdone‚•πah‚•π20 seconds
to compile‚•πidk i remember it took like 45-60 seconds yesterday
on j4‚•πim doing
j**2**4‚•πthats not bad‚•πno it isnt
now
compile me opencv‚•πokay
i will do it
really
how do I do it‚•πlike the fun version‚•πwhat do you want me to do
tell me what you'd like and I'll do it‚•πtbh i dont remember‚•πokay well if you find out I will definitely do it‚•πi just remember it drove me insane
because like
i wanted the arm v6 version
and the tutorials online were like
oh...
just
use a pi zero
and i was like‚•πI can compile it‚•πwft that's gonna take 10 hours
so i compiled it on my pc
and it took 12 minutes
idk how to do it tho
i forgot
but i didn't know how to transfer it to the pi zero
did you know
the original ifone is arm v6
like the raspberry pi zero‚•πƒ±lƒ±rƒ±l
ƒ∞stanbul
sure did
s…ôr did
estonian?‚•πno‚•πugh‚•πshould i?‚•πidk mabye‚•πi could prob do it in a few mins‚•πpretty sure it's estonian, or hungarian‚•πhungarian
imma do‚•πfor some reason its telling me i did not balance it but i did‚•πwhats ur kwestion tho
like whats wrong
lemme try
hold on‚•πuh
seems balanced to me‚•πexactly
idk whats wronf‚•πmaybe the (s) stuff
shouldn't be there
doubt it though‚•πit has to be
and the spaces dont change anything‚•πwait
so you got the rest of them right
with that formatting‚•πnope
i got one right‚•πhold on lemme do them‚•πthe other 2 r wrong
which means im formating them weird
with the coefficient
do i have to include a 1?
nope
that doesnt work either
this one as well‚•πtech jesus‚•πyes‚•πmiddle finger
haha‚•πNerd‚•πget an asrock 6800xt

I believe‚•πThen wtf is it telling me its not balanced correctly
thats stupid‚•πüòú
What the fuck‚•πsamantha uses emojis so much‚•πüòé‚•πi see a generalization upcoming

It‚Äôs weird
Just do it‚•πow wait
its because
they are not polyatomic elements‚•πiodine is a diatomic‚•πBrinclhof
I‚•πso I_2‚•πdiatomic‚•πYe‚•πwhatever
i should remember the diatomics‚•πSame haha
I didn‚Äôt get it at first either‚•πwhat is the fun word thingy‚•π?‚•πthe something family‚•πI can‚Äôt remember
The HON family maybe?‚•πow right

Flourine
Oxygen
Iodine
C?‚•πNitrogen, Hydrogen, Flourine, Iodine, whatever C is, Br‚•πBromine
Chlorine‚•πyea‚•πCl is chlorine
Yea‚•πHey sam, 4.1 question 5 answer
?‚•πso the diatomics
are an upside down L
+ Hydrogen
that makes sense ok‚•πsomeone give me answer for the last question
the one where u actually have to balance an equation‚•πwait which one
cuz i may have done it
also
what is the aqueous (thing)
is it (L)
for liquid‚•πno
aq
aqueous and liquid r different things
not that one‚•πk
cuz there are 3
that is the one i did‚•πthis one
gracias‚•πde rien‚•π"Thanks for doing my homework for me"‚•πhes doing mine for me
we are all
doing homework‚•πtbf i had that, i was just missing an aq at the end‚•πfor each other‚•πyes‚•πwanna just trade assignments
like
you can write a 1200 word IRR‚•πsong‚•πhaha‚•πand i could like‚•πno thanks‚•πdo whatever APUSH thing‚•πi have english to do anyway
u wanna present for me?‚•πpush a
no
even though I'm not bad at presenting
let's see how fsat my new computer renders a video
is it good‚•πuh wut
3 minutes‚•πha zoom‚•πr u kidding me?‚•πyes‚•πnot powerpoint‚•πi know it is zoom‚•πits suppose to be 10-12 min long‚•πi forced my groups to use powerpoint‚•πdummy
I would never do that‚•πfor all my projects‚•πjust like I don't‚•πwell no‚•πforce people
to use‚•πi just‚•πlibreoffice‚•πdownloaded the file‚•πsince that is stupid‚•πas a powerpoint‚•πthis is just me‚•πand made the video in powerpoint‚•πI cut out the rest in the video editor‚•πi would send you a hitfilm project to export‚•πoh thats fine then‚•πbut ur linux‚•πdoesnt matter
zande assumes no one knows how to edit videos
but I do know how to edit videos
no I mean the presentation quality (minus microphone quality)‚•πyea it looks fine
its clear and stuff‚•πgood
'tis gone now
i would join‚•πi do not
u prob can look up SA discord online
and find some‚•πwhat is SA discord‚•πhe wants a discord server on the books‚•πstormlight archive
i see
ok‚•πyea
Omega dark mode
Looks god awful‚•πuse red
that's why it is awful‚•πRed + Darkmode?
Hmm lemme try‚•πred + dark mode is ok
but i didn't like the dark theme myself‚•πyeah try it
also time it and tell me
i want to prove the 5900x speed‚•πHow do i time?
Time(command)?‚•πadd
time
before the command‚•πwhich number u want
the one before user or after‚•πthe one after user‚•π41.07s‚•πWtf happened here‚•πdont ask‚•πno
do ask‚•πcool
that is obv expected
u have x2 more threads then me
thast why ur x2 faster than me‚•πim running a test‚•π!‚•πin wsl
wsl v1
not v2‚•πNot bad
Not bad at all‚•πyea but epsilon light is better‚•πi agree‚•πBRO THAT FINGER‚•πclip
ur nails akhil‚•πLONG BOI‚•πoof‚•πi will‚•πi feel like im going to get some gold out of this contact name soon‚•πit gets stuck on objcopy‚•πCharles Booth‚•πreally?‚•πmine takes like <1 second for objcopy‚•πlook idk its running in wsl‚•πmine it blows through everything‚•πwsl1 bad for filesystem performance‚•πyea‚•πso anything could happen‚•πtry Linux‚•πif anything, the last part takes a few more seconds‚•πi should
imma try linux‚•πYAY‚•πgimme moment to boot‚•πalso make sure you update
since like‚•πim using pop os
latest thing‚•πwhich version
20.04?
20.10?‚•πidk hold on‚•πBRO IM JUST HERE FOR PC PARTS WTF IS THIS CHAT‚•πit's
actually pc parts
we are benching‚•πoh rly
Lmao‚•πyeh‚•πk so
how do you take screenshots‚•πscrot?‚•πno‚•πno like‚•πyou do
control shift printscreen
then
control v it here
for taking a screenshot of a window and copying it to clipboard
you do
control alt printscreen
control v
for the entire screen it's control printscreen control v
to save to disk
do commands without control‚•πwhat is "user"‚•πthe one you should care about I think
lemme see‚•πi dont think it took 2 mins tho‚•πreal‚•πyknow what
imma just use my phone stopwatch‚•πit doesn't really compile for me‚•πdid u clean?‚•πyes
like
it doesn't compile as in it doesn't have a final output
it fails to compile
lemme try getting it to compile‚•πcompiling with 4 threads is fun‚•πits the real that you care about
thats how long it actually takes
so mine took 40 seconds
hold on‚•πsame as me‚•πhow long did ramesh take‚•π18‚•πclean downloading
wait
what EXACT command did you use‚•πme?‚•πno cy‚•πmake clean
then make -j some number‚•π-j128‚•πi tried 12, 24, 48 all same
41 seconds‚•πsame
the exact same‚•πapps/Makefile:12: apps/atom/Makefile: No such file or directory‚•πre clone the git‚•πwhich branch?‚•πmaster‚•πnot a branch
here‚•πits mainly epsilon.elf thats the problem
it takes too long‚•πgit checkout omega-master‚•πregardless of anything‚•πyea
that takes a solid while‚•πwhat is that command doing‚•πthats the emulator
i think‚•πwait‚•πcause u run /.epsilon.elf when u do the simulator
if u do git checkout u can checkout different branches‚•πwait ramesh‚•πI know
that‚•πtime make PLATFORM=simulator
after doing that but clean‚•πwait I KNOW WHAT I DID WRONG‚•πhey cy‚•πyes‚•πhave u seen omega_dev‚•πno‚•πi kinda wanna install it‚•πlink‚•πI kinda got it to work‚•πwhats so nice about it‚•πidk
just looks intresting‚•πwait‚•πGuys‚•πwhat you sent me
is just regular omega‚•π3080 or 6800xt‚•π6800xt‚•πReasoning?
Besides price‚•πwait nvm‚•πbetter raster performance
cheaper
so if you want good now get 6800xt
if you want good later get 3080‚•πI just feel like the 3080 has a  more complete bundle
A‚•πIdk
I would go with radeon cuz linux drivers, but that's not a thing for you‚•πwait how do you get the dev version‚•πyeah its just development branch
cd Omega‚•πgit checkout omeag-dev‚•πgit checkout omega_dev‚•πomega‚•πit says bad‚•πno underscore‚•πit says that it would‚•πgit clone it into a new folder
then use sudo‚•πSUDO?
no sudo‚•πwhy no sudo?
fine do this
and then do git checkout‚•πit says my branch is up to date‚•πidk then‚•πwith origin/omega-dev
is that good?‚•πig
i havent tried installing dev yet
i want that RTC‚•πwhat rtc
what is rtc‚•πreal time clock‚•πis that in the dev‚•πthink so‚•πmake clean doesnt work‚•πit came up in the 1.21 beta changelogs
huh?
ask ramesh
he just fixed that problem‚•πhi ramesh
solve my problems‚•πOmega - ‚ÄúOmega does what Epsilon‚Äôt‚Äù‚•πwait now i cant get it to do the checkout‚•πhold up
what did u clone?
okay thats good
i thought u did clone the dev website
idk why checkout wont work‚•πcheckout works if i dont do ‚Äîrecursive‚•πbut u need to do recursive
for the submodules‚•πyea so
um‚•πidk, u can try to get it to work
but compiling is oddly satisfying
idk why‚•πif i do recursive
i can compile i believe‚•πyes‚•πyea so i can only compile when i do ‚Äîrecursive
and i can only do checkout if i dont do ‚Äîrecursive
wait so how do you see the changelog‚•πhmm, uh‚•πlike how did u know there was rtc‚•πcomplete changelog‚•πah i see‚•πi wonder what the discord bot does‚•πwhere even is the 1.21 version‚•πwhat eeven is that‚•πhey ramesh‚•πhi‚•πhow do you get the dev version of omega to compile‚•πwait
give me
20 minutes
and i will respond
bye‚•πum
why
k
linux scrolling is giving me a headache
like a genuine headache‚•πhow?‚•πits too slow‚•πthen use windows‚•πtell me how to compile the dev channel
im not unbooting and rebooting‚•πunbooting huh
never heard that one before‚•πdebooting
anti-booting‚•πnever heard that one as well
neither have i heard of that one
anti-booting sounds like a movement against booting‚•πalso if theres a font i like less than segoe ui
its this telegram font
it is awful
i hate it
i want something better‚•πpretty sure u can change it‚•πhow‚•πidk
dont ask me‚•πask‚•πim using mac store telegram‚•πGOOGLE‚•πim using lunix telegram
i dont like lunix telegram

i have an answer ^‚•πdir is a list of strings
what should this do‚•πuh‚•πi want to print each item in the list‚•πthrow a syntax error?
or
it prints the entire list‚•πhow to do that‚•πuhm‚•πwith shorthand notation‚•πnewline?
or space‚•πnewline
well
i mean‚•πprint("\n".join([i for i in dir]))
i think
no
print("\n".join(dir))‚•πbut actually
i want
to print‚•πit does‚•π1. list item 1
2. list item 2
etc‚•πum
cygh
okay
i got it
what is ramesh listening to right now
i am curious
interesting
mpv works‚•πk‚•πother than here
i dont really care about here‚•πwhat does enumerate do‚•πit adds an index
to the iteration thing
it like
for each iteration i think it returns a destructurable object
so then you do i, item and destructure into index, item‚•πi see
ok‚•πthis seems useful‚•πAutoHotKey
it does http requests
which means
i can make hotkeys
that control my room lights‚•πNice‚•πso i have AppsKey+1 through 9 and 0 and accent key
set to control my lights
which is fun
imma eat dinner bye‚•πxboxx

good
you start to see why the book is so glorious‚•πI will read it‚•πwor > twok > oathbringer
oathbringer was meh imo‚•πHmm alright
Im so fcking excited for this‚•πI want to get the WoR ending
it's so lit
like‚•πIts made by IOI‚•πit's just SO good‚•πReally?‚•πno more‚•πDidnt u say WoK ending was good‚•πWoR is best‚•πHes totally getting a shardblade‚•πOathbringer is just a bit like
why you say that
finish way of kings
trust me you'll like it
i could give you more names and‚•πBruh‚•πit would probably make you
read to the end tonight‚•πWhat if syl is a shardblade‚•πwhere did you get that idea from
legitimately curious...‚•πIdk‚•πkeep reading akhil keep reading‚•πSyl was just there right‚•πyeah
but like
does dalinar have a spren
does adolin have a spren‚•πno, which makes me not think its right
they dont have sprens‚•πokay
keep reading
you have to get to
words of radiance‚•πbut u kinda get the feeling the Syl is just more than a spren‚•πto understand shardblades
yes
she's kaladin's gf‚•πhaha‚•πkaladin x syl ship
easily‚•πyes‚•πdo you know what shadesmar is?‚•πnope‚•πokay
then keep reading
honestly though
i just want the bridgemen's stories
like how can rock see syl‚•πyea
thats intresting‚•πsanderson
loves
dramatic irony
so much
his entire book is built on it
that's what makes it so good
especially dramatic irony if you've read it before
since you can pick up on all the stuff before it happens
do you think there is no end of social commentary in the way of kings
i feel like there is so much social commenatry in these books‚•πyknow whats cool
windows is getting a cli package manager
the preview is available now
its called winget
um...
?‚•πI searched for spotify

freecad
and itunes‚•πi also
get the real
spotify‚•πand putty‚•πEW
putty is useless‚•πserial terminal‚•πthis is a song
yes telegram has a music player‚•πit does
the problem with winget is that at the moment it doesn't support appxbundle‚•πthey're STILL in stock
wow‚•πis ubuntu or centos more lightweight‚•πubuntu‚•πk‚•πor ask
mr. kolmer‚•πsee
theres this vps service
they will give me a server
for $12/y
but‚•πMr. Kolmer even suggested buying me an unRaid license‚•πi only get 128 mb ram
so um
and i can choose between
ow wait theres also debian‚•πis this
godaddy‚•πno
reprise hosting
essentially
theres this thing
which is probably bad
for $1/mo‚•πask jp‚•πtheres aws for $3/mo
but it is also kinda bad‚•πoo fancy
aws is better
imo‚•πand amazon is bad
dont like amazon
then theres digitalocean
for $5
which is better than the aws
its like the standard $5 tier
then theres azure
which
idk
then theres google‚•πlinode‚•πwhos pricing is a hot mess‚•πvultr‚•πwait lemme check them
hmm
actually
i like vultr
they have some realllly low end plans
they have a $2.50
and a $3.50
i would have to use ipv6 tho
is that a problem‚•πyes
i do not have ipv6‚•πwhats the deal with ipv6
what does that mean
you "dont have it"‚•πi cannot
access ipv6‚•πi see
hmm
that's a problem
i dont think i can either
welp
i guess that's out of the question‚•πwhere did you get this from‚•πWhy
why u guys gotta be like this
Dang it, if I only took a pic of Ramesh
Ok fair

Dihydrogen Monoxide is dangerous‚•πWhat happened here‚•πDihydrogen Monoxide happened‚•πI came back
To 100 messages‚•πAh‚•πCap‚•πit is dangerous‚•πWhy?‚•π:dup_bird:‚•πIm charging my kindle‚•πi mean unless you have a better domain
i wanted to do is akhil reading
can't buy a .in
actually I probably could‚•πU prob could‚•πbut it's not free
i got it better‚•πHuh
Thats too long
Moash is totally the villan isnt he‚•πyou want to know?‚•πHes totally gonna punch kaladin
Or one of the High princes‚•πget to book two‚•πOr Rock
Hes gonna punch someone
Thats for sure
Ooooo what if he punches dalinar‚•πoh you keep reading‚•πOr Elhokar‚•πi accidnetally want to coppermind
keep reading‚•πWhat if he pushes kaladin into a ditch‚•πkeep readinggggggggggggggggggggg
gg‚•πAlright‚•πalso
can't you read while your kindle is charging‚•πI mean normally yes‚•πwhy charge kindle
when you have this‚•πBecause i have to find the pg i was at
So i gotta turn it on for a sec to find where i was‚•πyou shaid
chapter 29‚•πYea but where in it‚•πjust read around
you will remember‚•πWhat that for?
U BOUGHT IT?‚•πnot the cpu‚•πYea ik not the cpu
Why?
Why did u?‚•πporque quiero crear un sitio de web‚•πBut why that domain?‚•πcy is attempting to use google cloud‚•πAh gl‚•πthat's a static site
thats a web service site
or i guess it was‚•πDoesnt work‚•πuntil it died‚•π502‚•πgoogle cloud is free
which is why im interested‚•πentitled credit card user‚•πfirstly
im using a debit card
and u have one of those
and secondly
well there is no secondly
it is good
f1-micro
for free
for ever‚•πWait actually?‚•πyes
well
ok
so
its 1 vcpu 1gb ram 1gb transfer 10gb storage
per month‚•πI need a cloud service so i can set up a mail server
Cause my home is stupid‚•πand you see‚•πAnd i cant use the mail ports‚•πso
when you create an account
with a payment method
they give you this and $300 credit
for free‚•πOoo nice‚•πbut
the $300 credit is only for 12 months
after 12 months
you lose your credit
and
you have to enable auto billing‚•πOh no‚•πin order to keep your f1-micro
but‚•πSo if u go a bit more than what it is
U get charged‚•πas long as you dont exceed 1gb transfer
they wont actually charge you
but‚•πYeah its like aws‚•πlike tbh
im willing to pay a little per month
in case
i go over quota
like $1 or 2‚•πYea but more than that nah‚•πthe thing is tho
for hosting most of my websites
which have cloudflare
not very much data transfer occurs‚•πYeah‚•πif …ôm…ôn…ô pay for web hosting tho
imma go with digitalocean or vultr‚•πDigital‚•πvultr has a $3.50 plan
ocean doesnt‚•πHmmm would 1gb transfer be enough for a mail server?‚•πI'm reading about Brightlord Meridas Amaram‚•πprobably not‚•πThats what I thought‚•πthe paid ones give you ridiculous amounts compared to that‚•πyeah unless you disable attachments‚•πlike
1tb‚•πthen it might be fine‚•πhalf tb‚•πWell u get 300$ first month‚•πI need to figure out how to use this‚•πSo how much is like the cheapest paid?‚•πfirst year
?
you mean what is the cheapest paid one available‚•πYes‚•πum
well‚•πYea first year‚•πtheres this sketchy one
for $1 per month
but it looks bad‚•πhow do you like
politely ask if someone is gay‚•πand it only has 128mb of ram
so im like
no‚•πYea‚•πtheres vultr $2.5
but it only has ipv6‚•πWhat is the best one in google cloud?
Like not the most expensive‚•πgoogle cloud is a complete mess
i have no clue
they have like 750 different services‚•πYea there are alot rnt there?‚•πand within those
like 750 different options‚•πHmm digital ocean is 5$ i think‚•πit is
they have simple pricing‚•πhelp‚•πJust ask
‚ÄúExcuse me good sire, but may I ask if you find pleasure with the same gender‚Äù?‚•πi like the vultr $3.5 tho
cuz it is actually usable
the cheapest actually usable
now
that being said‚•πWhats its specs‚•πlike i was saying‚•πwhat about furries‚•πif you go to aws
they have some interesting options‚•πThats not bad actually‚•πi believe they have a $3.70 plan
which may be better than vultr
idk
but
they also have some special thing
called
idk what but its cool
where essentially‚•πIdk i just want a mail server‚•πyou take whatever no one else wants on amazon's servers
and pay less
but
i dont think its available for these really cheap ones
its more for like big data workloads
that would cost thousands of $‚•πWhat is?‚•πthis amazon thing
hold on
but
i like the google thing
cuz its free
which is inf cheaper than all of these
and
i get 1gb of ram
which is nice
tbh i dont understand how it can only be 1gb transfer
that makes no sense
at all
i think its a marketing thing
they want you to pay for more
anyway like i said
thers cloudflare for a reason‚•πim writing a thing‚•πhes not watching rn
he just got systemctl to worok
the problem
was that
apparently
pip3 install
and sudo pip3 install
are 2 different things
the sudo
has its own pip3
asd;flkajs;dflkj‚•πno
sudo installs
to a different place
it installs‚•πyes
you see‚•πglobally
you see‚•πi was running as cyfinfaza‚•πramesh knows these things‚•πbut systemctl‚•πso cy could ask ramesh as well‚•πwas running as su‚•πah yes
you can also‚•πand so‚•πmake a systemd service
run as a specific user
√æƒì?‚•πi had to do sudo pip3 install flask
that way
the sudo
had flask too‚•πLook, gancho
i know
but
<insert more SA references>
nvm
;lasjkdfl;asjk
i bothced this one
or
you do
the user
as cyfinfaza
not root‚•πbut i can just install to the root user
i am now the usb alliance
i name things properly

Part 1
This article is about gender stereotypes in politics. The author argues that voters view candidates, in part, through gender stereotypes, that affect their view of both the position of the candidate, and their ability to deal with an issue. They also argue that these stereotypes result in worse effects for republican women candidates than they do for democratic women candidates.
on to part 2
which has to be like 3 paragraphs
should i have done this yesterday‚•πFix your capitalization‚•π?
would you like...
part 2?
Part 2
The author does not directly make this claim, but rather draws it as a conclusion in response to research and data collected. They examine the data that is collected and compare it to research that was previously done. Where their data match previous research, they confirm an identified stereotype. They then proceed to use the existence of these stereotypes to:
1. Compare them to data about actual outcomes, and draw their conclusion about gender stereotypes transcending party, and
2. Identify how these stereotypes would affect women of different parties, and then draw their conclusion about the difference in the favorability of these stereotypes to women between the different parties. 
Their progressive approach makes these main claims:
1. Gender stereotypes clearly exist in regard to the following issues and positions:
‚Ä¢ Education issue competency ‚Äì public bias towards women
‚Ä¢ Crime issue competency ‚Äì public bias towards men
‚Ä¢ Abortion stance ‚Äì women are more likely to stand for abortion
‚Ä¢ Women take a more liberal stance overall
2. The above gender stereotypes (other than the last one) transcend a candidate‚Äôs party. For example, democrat or republican, voters consistently believe women to be better suited to deal with education. 
3. The stereotype placing women as more liberal than men is disadvantageous to republican women candidates, as, since the republican party is biased towards conservative candidates, a stereotype labeling women as more liberal negatively affects their view to republican voters.‚•πsign it‚•πthe rtc finally killed it
that was actually pretty fast
i enabled the rtc 3 days ago
at 50% charge
i should disable the rtc
cuz like
imma be in a chem test
and its gonna die
yes i am aware of this
it is mildly exciting
the reason it is mild
is bc u have no cooler
so like‚•πKraken x63
Will order soon‚•πwhat do you still need
cooler and gpu right‚•πYe‚•πYAY‚•πso you see
i have been working‚•πOk‚•πplz send screenshot
of what u see‚•πI use bing sorry‚•πwhatever browser
i wanna see if it works
but then also akhil has safari
i see
ok
i was expecting desktop but ok‚•πIgnore the black top right thing‚•πbut you see
there is a problem
it is supposed to be blurred
the welcome thing's background‚•πThats j me binge watching the office cuz ppl called me living under a rock‚•πsee when people tell me im living under a rock
i tuck in further under my rock
cuz i dont wanna see them‚•πUnderstandable
The problem is with that
While there are bad ppl
There are also tons of good ppl‚•πik i just have a mental push to do that
idk why
anyway‚•πI am here
I shall do this in a bit‚•πCap
Complete cap‚•πcap?
cy is lost‚•πHow would one explain cap‚•πLying‚•πWell here lemme say it like this‚•πIt means or refers to lying‚•πYes perfect‚•πYep‚•πk
akhil u at ur mac
cuz its really ez‚•πOr say ‚Äúthat‚Äôs cap‚Äù‚•πscreenshot
done‚•πOk one sec then‚•πargh
i guess i need to find the safari version of blur
and
why‚•πyes‚•πare
those‚•πLooks p good on iPhone ngl‚•πthose
buttons

the buttons
r cut
a;sdlkfja;sdlfkj
k good
i was worried‚•πtook a really long time to load
use normalize.css‚•πwhat is that‚•πit will speed some stuff up
look it up on github‚•πk
but
now
theres another problem
the scrollbar
bad‚•πalso another bad
when i scroll there i no snapping‚•πhow its supposed to look
a;sdlkfja;sldkfj ;aslkdfja safari‚•πi can go inbetween‚•πwhy do i have to code for safari‚•πbut after 3 sec or so it auto moves it‚•πwhy
oh‚•πi8dk‚•πthen
i cant change it
if it does actually work‚•πjust set a ios header
so that if its safari it fixes some stuff‚•πi would
but it appears
that it actually does work
just safari delays it
how about the animations
do they work‚•πwhat animations‚•π*sigh‚•πi do not see any animations‚•πum‚•πlike when u click buttons on side?‚•πreload‚•πthat works‚•πk so you see them
k
alright
good to know
i see
so the scrolling sorta works
meh it works well enough
for safari users
safari users
can have their problems to themselves
at least it works after a second or two
now to fix the blur
alright
it blurs now in safari
i think
except
yknow what happens now
safari
is like
nope
imma just
not
load ur images
maybe ill load one
ow wait

but on hers
the images werent showing up‚•πThats weird‚•πtry regular safari
not embedded
and record video‚•πBlur works
But ur images aint loading
Its really finicky‚•πthe other issue
is that safari's vh

its also the area that gets blurred
under the options
im getting frustrated
everyone's website is better than mine

no slep is bad‚•πi oughta sleep right
which means being organized
you see‚•πyes‚•πi spent like‚•πno it does not‚•π4 hours‚•πi get good sleeep
no thats not organization
thats called priorities‚•πxactly
organization‚•πi always do hw first‚•πpriorities‚•πthen do stuff‚•πbut you see
even if i did my hw first‚•πthat way i dont have to kill myself finishing hw‚•πidk
ima nite time person‚•πnah‚•πduring summer‚•πsame‚•πi would like‚•πnight time is great‚•πgo to bed at 2
and wake up at 10‚•πwinter is a day time person
summer is nite
i shift
but i usually like going to bed at 9-9:30 on a school day
or just get hw done by 8‚•πme in summer:
yknow why im putting it down so gently in that video
its bc its 2am
and i dont wanna wake ppl
anyway
imma do my 2 hrs of hw
good night
could i video call with one of you
i wanna test something‚•πDo u still need help‚•πsure
do u have laptop and phone
with you‚•πYeah‚•πhey other children
other than matt
and i‚•πHello‚•πreload ur page
but hes studying apparently
btw its been updated
text me there‚•πYea try not to bother him these couple of weeks‚•πakhil
try out the new version
akhil
where r u
r u not in c0
when your raspberry pi
is downloading
at 1,380 petabytes per second‚•πThat good or bad?‚•πidk‚•πIll assume good‚•πcy is mad
he is trying to perform tuya-convert
on his pi
and
this
is what his pi is saying‚•πOof‚•πliterally what the f
haha‚•πIm from Walla Walla, Wa‚•πhow the f
does my pi4
not have a wifi interface
a;lskdjf;alskdjf;aslkdjf‚•πOof
Wait u prob messed up a config
Ive messed up the config before, made the interface unusable‚•πWindows has died
I'm flashing too many usbs at once‚•π*accidentally flashes his ssd instead *‚•πIkr‚•πWhat are the main differences between C sharp and java‚•πwait hold up‚•πthey broke my oled displays
because they were in the same package as heavy metal mounting bars‚•πoof‚•πbut there were 3 oled displays
and only one broke
so I was like
give me money
and they were like
ok
hers mony
u no need return‚•πHyelp plz‚•πc sharp is microsoft
java is oracle
they're both c based in terms of syntax
why do you want this information‚•πNo reason‚•πi now have 7 oled displays
1 of which is broken‚•πJk I‚Äôm making a game in unity with someone‚•πoh gl‚•πi see‚•πi tried, but gave up‚•πthat is cool‚•πcause i cannot make assets for my life‚•πWe alr have a plan for the game after a single day of brainstorming‚•πyou should make ur game run on my oled display‚•πBut I‚Äôve never used unity or C sharp‚•πme neither
well
i have used c#
but not in unity‚•πIs it j java?‚•πwell sorta
tbh i did it so long ago
wait
remember that geologic time model
in stem
i made mine in C#
with Universal Windows Platform‚•πOh ok‚•πoh and i also made the BerryTracker in c# UWP‚•πwhat‚•πthis‚•πi have been summon'th
yea
that was cool
looked nice as well‚•πi wanna learn android developement
but its like‚•πi wanna learn ios development‚•πu hav to giv permission to use the internet
and i dont wanna
yknow what i wanna do
plug one of my white oleds into my pi‚•πflutter?‚•πand use it as a display output‚•πhmm‚•πand then
play Minecraft on it‚•πdont think it would work‚•πthe problem is i only have 1 bit color‚•πbut u can try
u need what 8?
or 16‚•πno so what it would have to do
is like
take the image from the pi's screen
it being some kode
and it would have to convert it to 1 bit color
and downscale to 128x64px‚•πhmm‚•πthen send the image via smbus to the oled
which can refresh at about 35 fps i think
or 45 i forgot
the main issue is the color bit depth
its one bit
so like
no grey
just white
or black
ooo
i could make a terminal
so u dont need to plug in a screen
it would be a tiny terminal though
im trying to install windows on my raspberry pi
and its not working
bc the software is crashing
cuz im trying to flash windows to a usb instead of an sd card
i think‚•πyes
sam what r u guys gonna do for assets and stuff?
r u gonna create them from scratch or use pre-existing ones?‚•πNeither of us have photoshop
So props pre existing ones
How do you download assets
Like
Where do we go for assets‚•πthey r like .png files
google‚•πOh lmao‚•πi have some paid ones but most would be free
or u can get free photoshop‚•πAny good websites?‚•πthose assets are pretty nice
r either of u taking any art elective this year?‚•πNah‚•πah
i got free photoshop cause im doing animation‚•πBruh
I‚Äôve never used it before‚•πLet's create a new poll. First, send me the question.‚•πIntel or AMD‚•πCreating a new poll: 'Intel or AMD'

Please send me the first answer option.‚•πIntel
AMD‚•πüëç Poll created.‚•πAMD‚•πAMD
so then i fixed it
and the first thing it said after it came back up
was‚•πi opened it and got a zoom link‚•πtf
how on earth
oh
its probably one i sent to ramesh
i wouldnt try and join‚•πi wont‚•πi have a bag full of inductors
i am going to build a power supply‚•πvery cool
try not to blow urself up‚•πsee my goal
is full ac to dc
but
imma start small‚•πplease do‚•πi am just going to start‚•πdont blow or start a fire‚•πwith low voltage dc
to dc
im making a switching psu
ik how they work
its essentially
pwmming an inductor's output
with a mosfet
and using a diode to keep power flowing when its off
then you use the ramping properties of the inductor
to create a zig zag voltage
that's close to the one you want
then use a capacitor to smooth it out
it needs a controller tho
also my inductors may require a very high frequency
so idk how this is gonna work‚•πgl‚•πbut you see
then
once i have this
i can create an ac to dc changer
that's the dangerous one
its pretty simple though
just 4 diodes to form a full bridge rectifier
then a capacitor for smoothing
then feed the ac-dc phase into the switching phase
and you get a nice
smooth
regulated
variable
dc output‚•π‚ÄúFull Bridge Rectifier‚Äù - ElectroBoom‚•πFuuuuuuuul
bridddddddge
rektifiyeah
it makes the bumps
much bumps
nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
then
the switching phase
makes zig zag
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
ewektwoniks awe fwun
Q is the mosfet
D is the diode
and L is the inductor‚•πOoo fancy
I should learn how to read electrical diagrams‚•πah this spreadsheet
*sigh‚•πoh god‚•πdifferential equations
all i care about is that khz number‚•πhow this look‚•πtoo thin‚•πthats 10 px, so double?‚•πi mean
sure
still too thin
also
maybe round it
like rather than have sharp edges‚•πidk how to round lines in ps‚•πlike round the ends
or the joints‚•πlemme see‚•πhere hold on‚•πi mean at this point i might as well make them rounded rectangles‚•πwell maybe thicker
hold on
frankly idk its up to you
but that original was too thin‚•πthere u go
yea thats what my master copy will be
hmm ill try some other things‚•πwhat
see inkscape was being a bad
it literally
made like
a gradient
on something
and then my mouse stopped working
cheap things are wonderful‚•πthis was the original
yes‚•πfrankly i kinda like it italicized
like mine‚•πwell ill play around with it‚•πyes
now you see the issue is
200 khz
is not a fun khz
cuz my mosfet modules only do up to 20 khz‚•πhuh
thats not a nice number‚•πso i need a high frequency mosfet
which i think i have
but im probably gonna burn
cuz idk how to use it‚•πyes
dont burn‚•πi will have to read datasheets
would you like a challenge
these are some of the longer datasheets i have had to read
although the ones for mosfets are probably only a few pages
cuz they dont do much
they exist
they flow current
they stop current
and they burn
so 4 pages
compared to a microcontroller
that does literally anything
btw
you see in that image
how
the backup rtc runs in shutoff mode mode
that means that
it is possible
to keep the rtc running
in this chip
even in the lowest energy mode
which draws current in a matter of microamps‚•πidk what i did
microamps?‚•πfractions of microamps‚•πholy‚•πthey call them Energy Friendly for a reason
i have a dev board with one of those on it‚•πi need to get a dev board‚•πfrankly
get the same one i have
the stm nucleo f4
that way
we can collab
on understanding
it‚•πo yeah cause stm code is weird
__
_‚•πwell start with mbed studio
its easier‚•πhow this look?‚•πhold on‚•πoh yeah i should get this as well‚•πreminds me of this logo‚•πhmm its similar
but its not exactly it‚•πget this
imma try arm keil today
its like the old professional software
for arm mcus
after i do my math hw‚•πi should do my hw
but photoshop is more fun‚•πnow that's how to think like me
funny
we traded places today‚•πyea‚•πyou are not doing your hw first
and i am‚•πi also dont have any hw so‚•πi have to write my 1200 word IRR by monday‚•πi have to do animation and im done and animation takes like 2 hours‚•πthe thing is‚•πtoday is monday‚•πno next monday
the thing is though‚•πah‚•πit does not have to be 1200 words‚•πoo
how does this look‚•πinteresting
but
for what‚•π?
just as a design
i might use it as my logo on my website‚•πthe adafruits are falling out of the sky‚•πyes
YES
YES‚•πalso ive downscaled on my phone
so much more stuff fits on the screen‚•πthats good
what did u set it to?‚•π450 i think‚•π386 is what it usually is right‚•πi think it was 360 before‚•πthis looks natural‚•πnot in person
in person it looks real tiny‚•πhuh‚•πon screen
it looks like just a big phone
but that's the point
its supposed to give the feel of a big phone
on a small one
before
after‚•πit looks the exact same‚•πidk its much more pronounced in person
look at the before‚•πhmm‚•πwhile sitting back in ur chair
then switch to the after
without moving
that sorta reproduces the effect‚•πah i see it
yeah its not really pronounced
idk i kinda like this the more i stare at it‚•πstop staring at it
ppl dont do that
it will skew ur perception‚•πig
i shal do animation, and get other peoples opinnions on it‚•πk
half my Christmas lights died
i must figure out why
during that rainstorm‚•πHoly cow 266 messages wtf were u guys doing‚•πThat was no rainstorm‚•πLmao‚•πIts usually like that‚•πwhat was it then‚•πIdk‚•πIt was a thunderstorm‚•πk fine but it wasnt the thunder that killed the lights‚•πThunderstorm üå©‚•πit was the rain‚•πLightning storm ‚õà‚•πmost likely‚•πThe problem is the only thing is that the app crashes and the app crashes when you have a chance oruuwo get a notification on it cuz I can‚Äôt even run it to the app screen to download the earth version and it restore ur the earth app crashes plz plz update plz pls plz thx plz fix it pls pls add pls thx plz plz‚•πNope
I cant get one now‚•πits cyber monday‚•πIll try around christmas
Its the same price‚•πyou should also get a lora module‚•πI still don‚Äôt have the gpu üò≥üò≥üò≥‚•πthat way you can die like me‚•πOof

Part 1
This study argues that situational cues, such as being outnumbered by others of another stereotype group in a certain setting or environment, can have a large effect on their perception of the topic at hand, and their willingness to participate in it. This study examined specifically the perspective of women in MSE domains, a context in which stereotypes and situational cues tend to be very present. 
Part 2
Inherently, this paper is about ‚Äúidentity threat‚Äù, which they explain is ‚Äúa broad threat that people experience when they believe that they may be treated negatively or devalued in a setting simply because of a particular social identity they hold.‚Äù They examine what causes this threat to surface and affect the mental conditions and decisions of people, especially women. Before making their own claim, they examine already existing reasoning for the arousal of identity threat effects. They mainly reference how existing stereotypes affect how women perceive themselves in general, and how that is a reason for the aforementioned identity threat issues. They then hypothesize that, in addition to these always present stereotypes, there are also environmental effects that will affect how people who are in these stereotype groups will react and experience identity threat.
This study focuses on the MSE (Math, Science, and Engineering) context, which is a stereotypically male subject. For their testing and their claims, they choose women who identify clearly with this subject, in addition to men who do the same. This way, personally, all participants are interested in and identify with the subject, and only environmental cues and their associated stereotypes should affect how participants will make decisions about the simulated event presented to them. 
They begin by proving their hypothesis true. The results of their testing show that women are more likely to want to be a part of an MSE event that is gender balanced, than they are to the same event male dominated. From this claim they are able to determine that women prefer MSE environments in which they are not outnumbered, and thus deduce that environmental cues have an effect on stereotyped individuals‚Äô perceptions and decisions with regards to activities and events that occur in a context where they are stereotypically stigmatized. 
They further find that the above effects to women in MSE environments generally do not exist for men in the same environments, since they are not stereotypically stigmatized in MSE contexts, thus proving the contrapositive of the last claim true. 
Part 3
The evidence supporting the above claims is mostly sound, with the potential exception of mildly flawed testing. 
The main concern with the evidence in this research is the testing. Once again, the evidence is mostly sound; these are only minor concerns. The researchers used people who ‚Äúidentified‚Äù with an MSE context. The MSE context is very broad, and the researchers did not state how the video they played to the participants was supposed to be identifiable to all of them. Say for a moment the video shown related heavily to engineering. Let us also consider the possibility that women generally identify more with science, and men with engineering. Perhaps then, women were more likely to want to participate in a gender balanced event than a male dominated event, because they knew that even though the event was engineering based, they also knew that there would be more females there with whom they could collaborate on the science related to that engineering. This is an unlikely event, and it is unlikely that the researchers would have not considered it, but ways to avoid it are not mentioned in their paper. 
Beyond this, all other signs point to a sound claim. One of the authors, Claude M Steele, is one who I have already examined. Steele has written many papers on this topic, and appears to be quite credible, from past examinations. The paper also uses many sources to back their claims
, some of which are also from papers by Steele, though he is not the most cited in the paper. This paper, while sponsored, also does not appear to be having its goals manipulated by that sponsor, as the sponsor does not seem to be the kind to desire a certain result on this subject.‚•πhow stupid does this look?‚•πKinda

i see
so they are paying for cloud storage‚•πHe‚•πk‚•πactually its 2020, so sure they
uh it would seem so‚•πwell if u know
do u know
or not‚•π(They‚Äôre) name is Felix Mattick‚•πthey
whatever this is irrelevant
what is relevent
is how they are storing their data‚•πyup‚•πwhich is interesting
because "cloud bucket"
what is a cloud bucket
how much does it cost‚•πits just cloud storage
but whats intresting is the metadata
thats stored in a database‚•πhow do you access that cloud storage‚•πuh its usually tied to a ec2 instance
or any vps/cloud vm‚•πit is?
cy doesn't understand google cloud‚•πi mean thats how i use em
if i can explain it in aws, cause thats what i have used
u need to add storage to a vps‚•πgoogle cloud is like st
but for cloud services
so its effectively a way of storing files in a webservery way
heres my issue
what if ppl upload too much
then i will get automatically charged
and that is a bad
see‚•πjust set a cron job or file to empty it‚•πno i want it limited
so it cannot exceed a certain size
i do not want to be billed
in fact
i do not want to pay
at all‚•πhmm u would have to see then
i dont plan on doing cloud
cause i have a server\‚•πhow much can i get for free‚•πand storage
like 30 g‚•πi mean they said 2.6 cents per gb per month
on google cloud‚•πaws has 30 for free
if u have that cool 1 year thing‚•πim sure google has something for free
but yknow what else i can do
not this
google cloud has autodelete
it does it all for you actually‚•πwhile im over here having fun with photoshop‚•πcool‚•πjust get a server or a lot of storage
30 gb is kinda little‚•πim now interested in google cloud storage‚•πthey wont offer more than 50 for free‚•πi wanna see what it can do
even if its not for this project‚•πprob everything‚•πyea‚•πdoesnt linus use it for their backups‚•πidk
i dont think so
they have other plans
like archival plans
and stuff like that‚•πI was so close to a rtx 3080 but bestbuy stores more than 250 miles away üò§üò§üò§üò§‚•πoof‚•πship then‚•πtime for a road trip‚•πNope

Frankly, though I know it has been an important month of gratitude, I'm quite grateful that it's over. I didn't often know what to write, and it's a bit difficult. But, even though it's difficult and something I didn't want to do, that doesn't mean I'm not as grateful as you made us do it. You told us about all the benefits of doing an activity like this, and you're right. It was also a great opportunity to practice French, which really works. And so, while I'm grateful it's over, I'm also grateful that we had the opportunity to do it, and that you show it to us.

in my house
remember this
during the rainstorm
yea so somehow
an outside plug
controlled by a switch in the basement
also killed the plug
running our backup fridge
in a completely different part of the house
so now we have to eat all the food in the fridge
cuz its gonna go bad
and it is unclear why the plug doesn't work
why all these plugs stopped working

it just died and rebooted
idk if that is good‚•πIs that a blueberry cake‚•πyes
ha its actually working
its a little weird tho cuz the action light doesn't blink

OOBELOCALHELLO‚•πHello‚•πits letting me skip that

i guess were not gonna get the hello

that would be nice

ha
we're in‚•πNice
It good?‚•πum‚•πRun well?‚•πits a little faster than the slowest windows pc I've used
the graphics appear to only be at 30 hz
there's like 4 apps‚•πYay‚•πand sadly no wifi
so um
o wait
i can plug usb wifi
yknow its actually not that bad
like just going around the ui
the only thing that feels slow is the refresh rate
phone usb tethering
I am using an Application Class 2 micro sd card tho that's like really fast
actually i think the refresh rate
is not a driver issue
the gpu actually cant render scrolling that well
like the mouse moves at 60 hz
I'm silverbenching it
i think its running native edge
idk tho‚•π50
Thats the score‚•πno its gonna be faster
imma say 1500
or 1000‚•πImma say 80‚•πha jokes on us
3k‚•πHmm‚•πI'm telling you
its fast
much faster than you think
its just the gpu is terrible
it can't render windows animations at 60 fps‚•πUsed egpu‚•πu need pcie3 for gpu or thunderbolt for egpu
this has neither
imma start using the pi as my main pc
I'm installing unigram

I would still use an actual comp

I'm getting upset‚•πHuh‚•πbut

in fact
i think even x64 emulation is working‚•πOoo‚•πim running regular telegram

whats nice tho is that the web is working shockingly well
like
as if i was not on a raspberry pi‚•πHow many tabs‚•πnot many
but like‚•πHow many chrome tabs can it do‚•πwith only a few
idk
imma start using it
and see how many tabs
i got like 7 tabs
its a little slow now

does not work‚•πHmm‚•πthis version of windows doesnt have it

remember to change your delete timer to longer than 3 months‚•πYe mines 12 months‚•πi dont wanna go into school tmrw

and they were like the only people i knew in my classes in in person
other than like sam and matt during french
cy is going all virtual at the next available time
also thers koronaviris
and koronaviris is bad
koronavüëÅris‚•πyes‚•πwdym
oh I think its cuz they're like the web consortium or something
and they have defined things
that you must follow‚•πahh‚•πif you want compatibility on the web‚•πthat makes sense
yea im way to lazy to make css containers and stuff, so im exporting everything as svg‚•πbtw I stopped using the raspberry pi as my main pc‚•πgood‚•πcuz like
i need a comp for skool
that doesn't limit me
i cant
just
deal with a raspberry pi
and skool‚•πhaha
for school i open like 15 tabs\
that would kill the rpi‚•πfor skool i open like 50 tabs
especially ap seminar resarch
the problem with the pi is that like
i don't have a cooler for it
like if you see those images that i sent
its literally some random laptop fan hooked up to a battery
and its loud as hell‚•πyea‚•πbut without it
like‚•πjust use a heatsink‚•πimma 3d print another one of those nice cases‚•πah yes
nice case‚•πand maybe put a heatsink on it
i need a pi fan tho
and i have one
but idk where it is
i got 2‚•πjesus keep track of ur stuff‚•πand one of them is in the pi case running my server
the thing is
it does not leave enough space for a heatsink‚•πisnt a pi fan just a smaller fan?
that mounts in a case‚•πwell its labeled PI-FAN
its essentially a 30mm fan‚•πyea‚•πthat has a dupont connector on it
so you can plug it into GPIO
i has advisory

Michael is gonna have a nucleo
Akhil where is your nucleo‚•πi havent bought one yet‚•πmine came in the mail‚•πalright so i figured out what i must do to bypass the school firewall
i need a really fancy proxy
cuz a normal one doesn't work
i need one
that encrypts the url it wants

Gender stereotypes have been an issue in many contexts for as long as we know. In almost all cultures, gender was, for the longest time, something greatly stereotyped to the point that it defined the lives of most people.  As of the last fifty to one hundred years though, increased amounts of research are being done on the topic of gender stereotypes and their effects, due to increasing concern and awareness of the negative effects they have on people and society. Gender stereotypes affect the success of a wide range of entities, especially in sales and education contexts. This Research Report focuses on the effects of ‚Äúenvironments‚Äù, or the conditions surrounding a person, group of people, or activity and the events preceding that activity, on the mental state and consequent success of entities acting within them. One of the main drivers sitting between stereotypes and outcomes is something called ‚ÄúStereotype Threat‚Äù.‚•πWhat is this

I would talk about the gender discrepancy between speech intonation‚•πif you took a research class
you would have to be in a group‚•πyou wouldn't have a choice

not until tmrw‚•πno
you can‚•πand how do i log into naviance‚•πright now
but at the same time
idk if you need to register‚•πthis
hmm
alright im in naviance
but now idk how to actually get scores‚•πnow click the to thing
about me
my stuff
test scores‚•πwhat is the psat out of‚•π1520‚•πi have a 1330
how about you‚•πI have a not a 1330‚•πwhat, then, do you have?‚•πsomething
but let me just say
You don't have to share your score‚•πtbh i dont think the sophomore psat really matters
unless you get like
a 1520‚•πyeah‚•πum
yes?‚•πI started learning Korean because I LOVE BTS üíñ. I was born in the US and live in the US.‚•πi see‚•πnot me
that comment‚•πwhat do you think
of the design
plz open it in chrome‚•πit makes my fans spin
it's bad
because
like
this grey thing
is hurting me‚•πok im working on that
i need like
a media query
to detect firefox
and make it solid black
bc firefox users dont care about design
and blur‚•πif you do that
that is bad‚•πwhat do i do then‚•πit is awful
reduce this blur‚•πit needs to be blurred
other than the blur
what do you have to say‚•πthe ugly bar
is ugly‚•πwhat browser is this
no browser i have used shows that‚•πFirefox‚•πget
out
of
firefox‚•πNo‚•πnow‚•πyou see‚•πi am working on adding my media query‚•πthis is why
we
design websites
in firefox
then they work everywhere else‚•πthe media query
will disable the scrolling feature completely
and make the background black
for a;sdlkfj;alsdkfjas;d firefox users‚•πno
you won't do that‚•πthat way it is at least not broken
what
will
i do then‚•πgraphical glitches‚•πlinix
litrally linix‚•πprobably firefox
since it doesn't happen in chrome‚•πwell it will be solid black anyway in firefox
and a message will be displayed to the user
to make them use chrome‚•πyou know
you could just
change
the overflow
to overflow: hidden‚•πyes‚•πand then it works‚•πi could
but
i needs to be scroll
in case it overflows
bc it does overflow
so firefox users
will not be able to scroll
but that is fine
cuz it doesn't overflow often‚•πi can scroll‚•πwdym‚•πidk
i think
you should
uninstall chrome‚•πHaha‚•πeveryone uses chrome
oh and then we have a-keel‚•πThat is just wrong
I use
Firefox‚•πhe uses‚•πstupid apple browser‚•πsafar-ee
but lemme tell you
the apple browser
is much better
than firefox‚•πI don't swear‚•πidioCY‚•πyes
not
making your website work on firefox
is idioCY‚•πtell me the media kwiree
and the setting
where is the setting
i wanna disable blur in my firefox
for testing‚•πno
google‚•πthis is the code
i need‚•πI gtg
bye‚•πbye
this is what firefox users will see‚•πIs this discrimination?‚•πyes‚•πWhy do Firefox users not get the fancy blur effect‚•πbecause
firefox
does not show it
by default‚•πEven safari gets it‚•πyou have to go to the scary about:config page
to enable it‚•πOh thats scawy‚•πso if your browser does not support blur
you get a message
telling you to stop using that browser
i also disabled auto connecting to chat
to avoid the xss attacks on ppl
so you have to explicitly click
the connect button
is now‚•πnice‚•πcoppermind is FILLED with spoilers for things I don't know yet
i accidentally spoiled something again
i hate coppermind‚•πAll of my tireless reading of aerospace textbooks has finally paid itself off‚•πAh yes‚•πGender stereotypes have been an issue in many contexts for as long as we know. In almost all cultures, gender was, for the longest time, something greatly stereotyped to the point that it defined the lives of most people. And implicit bias with regards to gender stereotypes exists in even the youngest of our generations (Martin 1990). As of the last fifty to one hundred years though, increased amounts of research are being done on the topic of gender stereotypes and their effects, due to increasing concern and awareness of the negative effects they have on people and society. Gender stereotypes affect the success of a wide range of entities, especially in sales and education contexts. This Research Report focuses on the societal and cultural aspects of gender stereotyping, as well as the effects of ‚Äúenvironments‚Äù, or the conditions surrounding a person, group of people, or activity and the events preceding that activity, on the mental state and consequent success of entities acting within them. One of the main drivers sitting between stereotypes and outcomes is something called ‚ÄúStereotype Threat‚Äù.
All individuals are part of various stereotype groups ‚Äì groups of people that share attributes and stereotypes. The stereotypes that apply to these stereotype groups are usually a mix of positive and negative, and all individuals are part of a stereotype group which is negatively stereotyped in some way or another. Stereotype threat is the ‚Äúrisk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group‚Äù (Steele 1995). Stereotype threat becomes an issue for people when they are in an environment where a negative stereotype towards them is relevant. For example, say women are stereotyped as being worse than men at math. This stereotype will not matter in most contexts, but once women are placed in a mathematics-oriented environment, their negative stereotype will become relevant, and the effects of stereotype threat may surface. These effects generally consist of increased stress, and consequently decreased performance in many areas. Stereotype threat can also affect decision making, in sales and finance environments. 
Stereotype threat affects people in various environments. One of the biggest ones, though, is education and MSE (Math, Science, and Engineering) contexts. Many groups are negatively stereotyped in this area, but this Research Report will focus on only stereotypes relating to gender-based groups. In general, when it comes to these contexts, negative stereotypes tend to be experienced by women, and so a lot of research surrounding this will be studying the differences between women experiencing negative stereotypes, and men not.
Research has been done to analyze where specifically women are affected in computer science programs (Stoilescu 2011). This research called this the ‚Äúlevels of digital divide‚Äù, and they specify 3 levels ‚Äì access, instruction, and opportunity to foster in culture. They found that in terms of access to digital technology, women are roughly the same as men. In terms of instruction though, a divide starts to appear. And it is finally in the opportunity to foster in computer science culture, that a clear and concerning divide exists. Stereotype threat almost certainly plays a role in this. Proving this is research that has determined that, from a young age, children, especially girls, automatically associate with their gender‚Äôs stereotype (Galdi 2014). These children do not neccesarily outwardly state or agree with it, but because they associate with it, they experience the effects of stereotype threat. This likely causes the aforementioned digital divide as these girls grow older. Another fact that may play a role in this is that women prefer gender balanced environments, rather than majority-men environments, and are more likely to be in agreement and willing to participate in these environments (Murphy 2007). This, in combination with automatic stereotype association early on, is likely to be the main cause of the great gender digital divide at a cultural level. Interestin
gly though, despite stereotypes disassociating females with MSE in education, studies show that at a young age, children believe that girls are academically superior to boys (Hartley 2013). They also found that, just like with women in MSE, this stereotype induces stereotype threat in young boys, and causes them to perform more poorly on tests than young girls of similar academic talent.
Much of the research on gender stereotypes and stereotype threat in education (mainly MSE) also examines testing, and how different environmental and psychological cues affect scores of people who may experience stereotype threat. For example, it has been shown that discussing or announcing scientific facts about gender stereotypes to females before a test affects their score (Dar-Nimrod 2006). If you tell them that they generally do not perform as well as men, they will experience the effects of stereotype threat, and not perform well. But, when some women were told that the latter was not true regarding the specific test being used in the experiment, women did not feel as pressured or stressed from stereotype threat, and they performed much better (VIDEO). Additionally, research has shown that stereotype threat has an effect even before test taking, when the content is being taught (Appel 2012). Students who are part of negatively stereotyped groups tend to be less focused and less motivated, causing lower rates of retention and mounting on the already existing effects of stereotype threat on test scores.
Distancing from children and young adults in education, we will now discuss the effect of genders stereotypes on adults in the workplace, and in sales, both on the company side and on the consumer side. From the examination of the research that has been done on gender stereotypes, it appears that gender stereotypes are less of an issue in this population than in educational contexts, but while this is the case they are still significantly pervasive in adults.

that's whats weird
about ap seminar
its an objective overview‚•πstill, in the overview of the topic that you are presenting‚•πbtw that's not the whole essay‚•πyou should not have the majority of your evidence and reasoning for such be off of senerios and not auctual events‚•πthats like 80% of the essay that you read
yes
so about this
i am researching specifically the "environmental" lens
or situational
or like
the environment ppl are in
and i have to use research
which is experimental
ik what you're thinking
cuz like
u do deb8
where like
ppl needa be convinced
and hypothetical situations dont convince ppl‚•πlike you say that girls prefer a environment that is non homogenous‚•πyes‚•πin that you are not presenting and issue, if anything that is considered an annoyance‚•πwell it is reporting on my research
idk
you see
Since it became widely available, abortion has been a large topic of debate for people of different cultures and beliefs. It has brought about great conflicts, due to the widely varying views of the issue (Solinger). On one side of the abortion argument, are people who believe that getting an abortion should be the choice of the mother, and not the choice of any governing or religious party. They believe that the health and social/emotional wellbeing of the mother is most important. Many of them also believe that an unborn fetus, especially in earlier stages of development, is not to be considered alive, and that it will not feel any pain if its development is aborted (Frost). On the other side of this argument is the antiabortion or pro-life argument, which argues for the criminalization of abortion. Many of these people are religious and/or believe that life starts at conception (Thomhave). They believe that, for this reason, an abortion, which kills the fetus, is an act of murder. These people believe that their beliefs should apply to everyone, thus their intent to criminalize it. 
But, alongside the existence of these two sides, there exists a large middle ground. According to an investigation by B. J. Rye and Angela Underhill, most people, in fact, take a middle position, of which there are two (Rye). One of the middle positions they describe is the ‚Äúdilemma‚Äù position. People who take this position are against abortion themselves, but they believe in the right to choice ‚Äì knowing that there are people who do not share the same views as them. The other main middle ground position described is the ‚Äúregulated‚Äù position. These people are for abortion ‚Äì they would get one or suggest one in appropriate conditions, but they believe that abortion should be heavily regulated and controlled. Neither of these positions can really be characterized into pro-life or pro-choice, since they both have an opposing opinion and legislative factor, resulting in a total of 4 discrete positions that most people‚Äôs opinions on abortion could be categorized into. 
As Elizabeth Porter explains, like many controversial issues, abortion is a complex topic that requires considering the problem from many different perspectives in order to fully understand it. Legislature that properly deals with the problem and satisfies the most people must be created by people who understand it properly (Porter). Major areas of concern with regards to Abortion include but are not limited to ethics, science, health, and government. 
Abortion laws, given their name, are an issue greatly revolving around the government. In 1970, the Roe v Wade supreme court case occurred. This case, arguably the most important event in the history of abortion law in the US, set an especially important precedent for future abortion-related discussion. This case resulted in a decision that the constitution of the United States gave the people, through their right to privacy, the right to a healthy abortion without restrictions from the federal government. This case and its result, despite their age, are still being discussed and fought over today. Additionally, during this time, parties took sides on the abortion debate. During this time, republicans, seeking support from religious citizens, adopted a pro-life stance (Williams). This, as intended by the republican party, did end up attracting many religious people and resulted in the Republican party overall taking a pro-life stance (Williams), which they still mainly hold today. On the contrary, democrats today tend to take up a more pro-choice stance. With almost every democrat-republican debate today, pro-choice versus pro-life comes up. 
In addition to the governmental aspects of the abortion debate, there are also many ethical, health-related, and social/cultural concerns with regards to abortion. As stated earlier, religion is one of the biggest drivers of the pro-life movement. Abortion does not comply with many, if not most religious laws and restrictions (Frost). This primarily stems from many religious beliefs that life b
egins at conception (Frost), and that therefore, killing a fetus at any point constitutes the murder of a living human. Many scientific studies though, have found that, especially in developing countries, access to safe abortion procedures plays a large part in bettering women‚Äôs health (Berer). For many women, an abortion may be desired or required to an extent that, regardless of laws or policies, the woman will go to whatever lengths neccesary to get one. This, especially in developing countries as mentioned before, ends up with many women getting abortions in illegal, and often highly unhealthy ways that could cause serious health problems or death (Berer). 
Overall, the debate over abortion rights and restrictions is a heavily present part of our modern society. While it is not clear that we will settle on correct laws and procedures any time soon, a lot of research is being done on this topic, with the aim of helping facilitate the correct decision.
that got a 92‚•πim read it one sec‚•πalso like i said what you read was 80% of revision alpha 1
like
the first draft is due wednesday‚•πso from what I understand
you have to present bolth sides of an argument
and just say a controversy exists  here
right‚•πwell so
theres an issue
with lenses
perspectives
contexts
and populations
we are supposed to research these
for this assignment
each group member
is doing a different lens
then
after we research
we review the different perspectives, populations, and contexts
and write an Individual Research Report (IRR)
then
as a group
we create a team presentation
discussing a solution we came up with
that addresses all the different aspects of the issue
that we each studied
this is the IRR‚•πok so you are just presenting the single side
ooo
but still‚•πwell
the single lens‚•πyour argument is flawed‚•πbut what is my arguement‚•πthat girls are being pressured to not go  into academically rigorous fields
right‚•πi mean i guess if you put it that way
yes
one half of my IRR
discusses the issues females face in education
due to stereotype threat‚•πso what im saying is that the evidence that you present to back that up
is not based on concreate facts and is merely objectave
in like a constructively criticly way‚•πbut its an "objective overview"
so like‚•πooooooo‚•πhere hold on‚•πthen y u no present the male side
cuz ur only doing an overview of the female perspectave‚•πwell
no
so
i mean
the thing is
its not a vs thing here
unlike abortion
that one was like
choice vs life
whereas this is different
its not like ppl are arguing for stereotype threat
so in this case
there are not really perspectives
its more like populations
so you read the part about children and young adults in education
the other population i discuss after that is adults in business, sales, consumerism, and finance
idk this is ap seminar
nothing makes sense
but this approach worked last time
i gtg to watch 40 mins of history video
bye
i will meet with the teacher tho
cuz like
yall are telling me my essay is bad
so imma talk to mr y‚•πjust
change
it
so your thesis
only talks about "gender stereotypes on women"
then you acknowledge that it's only one side and that's all they expect
sums up ycombinator perfectly‚•πtell me what the "sides" are that you propose‚•πgender stereotypes on men‚•πwhen it comes to stereotype threat‚•πgender stereotypes on women‚•πresearch shows that stereotype threat, especially in MSE domains, is only present in women
when it comes to gender‚•πplease remind me what MSE stands for‚•πMath Science Engineering‚•πNot necessarily
Didn't you say in your essay
that "men assume women are better at math than men"‚•πno
i‚•πwhat did you say then
I‚•π"interestingly remarked"
that‚•πOh‚•πyoung children
saw girls as academically superior‚•πwhat if
they are
which makes male performance drop‚•πthey are not neccesarily, but stereotype threat can cause effects on boys in this scenario‚•πtherefore
can you say "only affects women"‚•πbut that is not neccesarily true‚•πit is necessarily true
I believe that many people I know would agree
that it negatively affects males
Look‚•πi am going to school‚•πI'm sure you can find studies
that prove the other point as well‚•πplease find me studies‚•πYeah see if you're not willing to look at the other side modify your thesis
that works well‚•πlook im just reporting on my research
and my research showed that this is an issue for women‚•πwell I mean other than your research you should probably extend that and see if there are discrepancies‚•πidk imma talk to the teacher
idk what he wants‚•πYeah you should bring this up with him
I have to go now
bye‚•πbye

Amazon makes their own CPUs
they're a diy company
except
instead of making smart plugs themselves like me
they make their own processor architectures
and logistics distribution networks
some of the worlds most expensive things to do yourself‚•πoooooooooo‚•πcuz vertical integration
it makes aws more efficient
then if you add that to not caring about the environment, workers, or privacy
it creates low cost
and results in monopolization
i dont like amazon
they are bad for everyone except me
but i dont like them
bc i have empathy for others
its
firefox
you know
how i feel
about firefox
at least firefox is not bad for society like amazon is
the government needs to cause amazon's agar blob to hit a spike ball
and demonopolize
google is mostly ok
they seem to care a bit more abt ppl and environment
and Microsoft is good bc they support open source and they also seem to care to a certain extent abt ppl and environment
and apple needs to be cornered by the Europeans into creating good stuff
since the …ôm…ôr…ôc…ôns won't do it
really the Europeans kinda have to force everyone to do what theyre told
theyre the only ones that can‚•πapple
needs to be split‚•π?‚•πit is
larger
than amazon‚•πYea and‚•πand making society worse‚•πIs it
If u think about it
Apple only grew this large because of society‚•πimessage
is a scourge on society
and this isn't because I don't have it
I do‚•πSociety adopted imessage
I agree imessage sucks
But somehow this happened‚•πyeah I know
the thing is
it's ethically wrong‚•πWhat is
Imessage is ethically wrong?
Or do you mean just apple in general‚•πimessage is
because
by using something that is locked to one platform
you're effectively hindering society's communication‚•πSee i would agree, but no one is forcing someone to buy an iphone‚•πRight but you are forced to
if everyone you know uses imessage‚•πYea thats valid‚•πLike you could say "switch"
but people won't
cuz they're stupid‚•πOk hold up
Switching isnt the easiest thing for people‚•πfor me it would be‚•πFor u sure‚•πsince like‚•πBut for many other prob not‚•πI don't have a lot of friends
yeah
thus imessage is bad
and unethical
because it prevents user choice‚•πI mean im on an iphone and dont use i message anymore
Im split between telegram and whatsapp‚•πYeah
I don't use imessage
but like
I know a lot of people who do
and only use imessage
and know of no other messaging platform‚•πReally?
Thats kinda weird‚•πbasically
just
every girl‚•πHuh‚•πplus some others
and I don't think I'm making a gender stereotype here‚•πUr prob not‚•πI have to add a few more nuances
but it's mostly true‚•πYea‚•πlike white people probably
and ones that don't play video games
since those use Discord‚•πImessage doesnt have the best features
Yea
Discord is nice‚•πDiscord isn't very bad actually‚•πYup if u have a use case for it‚•πyeah well
all my friends other than you guys use it
but I kinda like telegram more
the UI is more
uhm
fun‚•πyea telegram is nice
whatsapp is also not too bad‚•πI won't use it
since it's facebook‚•πehh idrc‚•πI thought telegram is a literal clone of whatsapp‚•πidk i just use it for groupchats
uh i have to take a quiz today in ap classroom‚•πit has a lot of features‚•πi dont wanna‚•πbut its bad
cuz of how unoptimized it is‚•πI just use it because other people use it
and I can too‚•πi think thats just u‚•πYeah‚•πno‚•πi run discord 24/7‚•πthe lag in the voice calls‚•πit's just you‚•πis so bad
ok i was on a call with calum‚•πI saw a Hacker News comment
and it was like‚•πsetting up mediawiki‚•π"linux is not meant for people who want detailed sensory feedback"‚•πhe was connected to my pc via quick assist‚•πThus cy
also elementary OS is getting macOS touchpad gestures
which is‚•πand talking to me over discord‚•πinteresting‚•πthe audio of him typing over discord‚•πi mean thats ur wifi‚•πwas literally a second behind‚•πHe probably has ethernet‚•πthe remote desktop connection‚•πcy are you paying attention‚•πthats def just u, cause discord is used by many people‚•πYeah‚•πidk idrc‚•πand its known for its good audio and stuff‚•πthis thing he does not be noticed by me‚•πyea but like
discord is generally the only place when ppl cant hear me
idk
discord doesn't work well for me‚•πYeah well‚•πand its electron‚•πI only use discord for DMs
like‚•πelecrtron is bad‚•πdirect messaging
yeah
also‚•πwdym groups are literally the only good feature‚•πlemme show you something cy
telegram uses
an enormous amount of ram‚•πyeah but its not as slow and buggy as discord‚•πhow am I using 12 gigs of ram‚•πand i use unigram‚•πit is a bit buggy on linux‚•πmeh
im tired
very tired
i woke up like
20 minutes ago‚•πimagine
ive been awake since 5‚•πi went to bed at 00:45‚•πoof
u should sleep better‚•πi was really awake tho
i was doing my hours of math
imessage is not a problem for the world
not like amazon is
i message is irrelevant
its a business strategy
and its legitimate‚•πimessage is an unethical business strategy
and prevents competition
thus must be killed‚•πno it doesnt‚•πwell hold up‚•πi message is not anticompetitive‚•πimessage is exclusive‚•πyes‚•πthats something different‚•πno
because of its nature‚•πand that is legitimate‚•πXbox and Sony do the same thing‚•πits exclusivity
makes it anticompetitive
since it is a key communication tool‚•πwhat is anticompetitive
is apple music‚•πno‚•πSony has exclusive games, and so people have to buy a PS to get it‚•πand app store purchases‚•πand it wouldn't matter if it's restrictive‚•πwith 30%‚•πsince it's not an essential service‚•πand the inability to tell users about it
that is anticompetitive
but really
its not like
amazon
amazon
kills‚•πimessage is bad, but its a good buisness strategy‚•πcompanies
the environment
mistreats workers
wants to take over the world‚•πapple
also wants to do the same‚•πbut not in an anticompetitive way‚•πin a way that makes people believe
it's not anticompetitive‚•πits really only theyre software to a certain extent‚•πtheir
cygh‚•πim really tired
i typed their the first time
then erased it
and typed theyre‚•πGrammar should be innate‚•πit is
but reflexes transcend grammar innateness
^^ title for a paper‚•πCygh‚•πmy phone is burning me

now known as tsurai‚•πah yes voidity
apple man‚•πyeah
except i don't use that account
since I used it to circumvent this thing where I blocked someone on my account
so I could talk to him there
but I blocked him there as well‚•πits not like my xiaomi
whos thermal pad
was not installed correctly
so instead of getting hot
it just got slow
and then it fried its gpu‚•πdamn‚•πNice‚•πRamesh used a capital N

i dont like samsung
they like‚•πget apple
im telling you
and then get some airpods‚•πi want google pixel‚•πthey are magical‚•πbut they do not offer 256g storage‚•πi also do‚•πso im stuck with samsung‚•πmy friend has the pixel 5, its so nice‚•πif i want stuff that is good‚•πwhy do u need so much?‚•πyes im sure
so is the surface laptop‚•πive been using 64‚•πbut it doesn't have thunderbolt‚•πAryan has a pixel 5
are you friends with aryan‚•πyea‚•πhow friends‚•πlike game together and hang out friends‚•πAre you in his discord
where you vc with him
throughout the day‚•πmy problem with the galaxy is that its small and powerful‚•πlike Andy Pei‚•πnope‚•πso it drains
drains‚•πi dont usually do that‚•πi was friends with him‚•πYeah same‚•πat some point‚•πmy friend does that
Yeah I have lost a few friends this year
and I gained a few
eg. Akhil‚•πmy Samsung is too hot
you see i want a bigger phone
with a bigger battery‚•πi do not‚•πthis small phone
if the cpu goes to max
its draining
at like 50% per hour‚•πI might just go read rhythm of war
but like‚•πcuz the battery is so small‚•πYeah well
get an iphone‚•πowie it hurts‚•πthey are
premium
and not junk‚•πits
louis‚•πi bet ur samsung is gonna explode‚•πrossmann
the owie test‚•πlouis rossmann has
interesting political views‚•πlouis rossmann is one of those new yorkers
whos like
you know‚•πhe has a superiority complex‚•πidk if he "conceales failure" tho‚•πyes
but he has a superiority complex
and
the viewers
blindly believe him‚•πi dont‚•πI don't
"racism isn't real"‚•πi dont watch him so
define real
can i hold it no
does it exist yes‚•πyeah
but like‚•πlouis rossmann‚•πlouis rossmann thinks racism‚•πis interesting‚•πis not real‚•πidk
i never heard him say that‚•πhuh‚•πI am pretty sure‚•πi hear him talk about other things‚•πive never watched any of his videos
lemme see some later‚•πi care more about macbook repair
than politics
from him
im not interested in his politics
k i gotta pay attention now
idk how to use the debugger
bye‚•πadios‚•πi wont
akhil read the story‚•πi did‚•πentirely?‚•πyea
its a page and a half‚•πwhaddya think of it‚•πits intresting
its good‚•πlike
what were the three words‚•πit tackles intresting topics
probably cause he hates love I love you‚•πyeah‚•πor the opposite I hate you‚•πno it's I love you‚•πyea expected‚•πlike
how do you think the flaying scene happens
he has PTSD from it‚•πhmm
see heres what im wondering, is he hurting himself, or was that his parents?‚•πthat was his parents
I think
it was implied‚•πyea it was‚•πbecause like‚•πjust wanted to make sure‚•π"at my face"
implies it
so someone else is doing it‚•πi mean u prob could so it to yourself‚•πyeah but like also
wait
Okay I will try to make that more clear‚•πso its because he said 3 words‚•πthree other people know‚•πand going by the topic of love‚•πwhat does that tell you‚•πout of how many?‚•πother than him
three other people know of the deed‚•πah so his parents and someone else
he prob said I love ‚Äúthem‚Äù(whoever he loved)‚•πuh
then why would the parents tell the other person
after
whipping him
and leaving him‚•πhmmm
then i kinda dont know what they are‚•πhe just
tells someone
else
"I love YOU"
then she tells his parents‚•πand then they wip him, what is she his sister?‚•πno
they
dont let him
explore his sexuality‚•πhuh
this sounds similar‚•πto?‚•πthis sounds kinda similar to someone i know‚•πhrngm‚•πhow is lockdown browser?‚•πcan't use it

loard appow‚•πat least bose can actually be used in a professional enviroment
these cant‚•πare they Bluetooth only‚•πthink so
why would they have a jack
the phones dont even have a jack
the only thing that looks decent on the headphones are the pads‚•πthe maks do‚•πid say mid feb‚•πits bluetooth only
H1 chip‚•πIdfc‚•πits garbage
litteral garbage‚•πidk the lack of headphone jack
is a dealbreaker
at $500‚•πyea i would want one‚•πyeah

nope
it doesn't work in vms
although
this is about the most obvious vm environment
literally windows sandbox‚•πoh i know how they figure out‚•πha they knew i would try compatibility mode next‚•πI figured out how software detects if its in a vm‚•πhow‚•πwell the most obvious way would be when it gets the hardware serial number
hardware model
or manufacturer‚•πwell i mean
on windows
windows already knows for you
see the "Virtual Machine: Yes" property
in task manager‚•πyea‚•πso this will not be the solution
hmm
idk what im trying to do
run it in a vm?
hmm
we're gonna do wine on linux
in a vm
hmm
it installed
and didn't say it wouldnt run
but it doesn't seem to be working
meh imma stop trying to hack the software
u need some fancy wine config‚•πyes do hw‚•πi did the reading during lunch
so i have some time‚•πgood job‚•πi am listening to a guys and dolls song
and i like it
its my favorite one‚•πim listening to jazz‚•πthis is somewhat jazzy
its sorta 50s-y
i like 50s music‚•πnah hard rock, rock and jazz
those r good
ehh‚•πehh what‚•πnot to my taste‚•πidk ur taste
u like
listened to
what was it
Paradise by Bazzi
and
um‚•πSee those r what pops up in the Daily mixes‚•πspotify?‚•πyea‚•πyeah i listen to that too
i wanna make a playlist that plays on my website
if you click play‚•π......‚•πbut the goddamn DMCA is getting in my way‚•πyea i was gonna say‚•πthey only let it play 30 seconds of songs if the user is not signed in
so i could try and identify whether the spotify cookie is saved
and if it is
enable the player
otherwise display a sign in message
here hold on
all the music services have embedded players
deezer though goes into depth
on what happens
the problem is
i dont want ads
or 30s limits
and i dont want some random mix
smloadr is a thing
but imma not do that
cuz like
DMCA
is gonna sue me
now
interestingly
i could use youtube
you can embed YouTube playlists
and as far as i know they dont have ads
and are legal‚•πthey dont?‚•πidk imma see rn
hold on
asdflkajsdhflaksjdfhlaskdjfha
what is it
with this
music does not appear in embedded players‚•πhuh‚•πlike
it doesn't work‚•πquick question, whats one reason the amish are more likely to sruvive the next century
huh thats weird‚•πum
because they survived the last‚•π*clapping*
Genius‚•πnow i will figure out a way to embed music in my website
just wait
well actually here was another option
livestream it
like have a stream server
that http streams audio‚•πoo that would be cool‚•πand then the website picks it up
then
technically
i am not breaking DMCA
cuz
im not letting ppl pick what they wanna hear
its not on demand‚•πwell hold up‚•πyes i could break dmca to make this all easier‚•πisnt that the same thing with Twitch and DMCA and that whole ordeal‚•πidk
dont know about that‚•πcause streamers were playing music‚•πi dont use twitch‚•πi dont either
but it was a big thing‚•πyes
this one is good
is sending a video‚•πcy is adding music streaming‚•π*cygh‚•πu have cool thingy
u have >> instead of ...‚•πi have awdio
its not there yet

oh
you're using a stream‚•πyes‚•πor are you‚•πi am
because DMCA‚•πInteresting‚•πfirefox is being finnicky
it works the first time
but if you reload it stops working
it works again‚•πit works very well for me‚•πidk
you're the only one who uses firefox‚•πyou like‚•πso that's good‚•πreload it once‚•πmoving on‚•πoh it randomly greys out
why don't you
make it not grey out
if I want to listen to it
I will do‚•πits supposed to grey out if the stream is down
which will likely end up being the case
for a while‚•πthat feature seems to be broken‚•πnot in chrome
imma change the music
to something better
than Campfire by Retrovision
on repeat‚•πLemme check
Greyed out‚•πa;sdlkfja;sdlkfjas;dlkfj
what is the error
in the console
take a screenshot
and try in chrome too‚•πNice one‚•πEdge works‚•πk‚•πworks flawlessly in edge‚•πwhat is the error in safari‚•πi was gonna say that
lemme check in safari‚•πsafari and firefox are not working
this was the firefox error‚•πum see about that
safari has no error‚•πhave fun‚•πtf‚•πthis is funny‚•πthe console has nothing‚•πgreyed out in safari‚•πwdym
what
what is the issue‚•πin safari
smooth scrolling no exist‚•πyea
ik
stop using safari
thats the solution‚•πno
that is not a solution
for
greg gardener‚•πyou see there are 2 ways to make a website
the compatibility way
and the nice way
and this
is the nice way‚•πoh btw‚•πwhat‚•πsnap scrolling no work in edge‚•πum
yes it does
unless you are in mobile mode‚•πum i thinl
for safari no error messages pop up, so i did some digging‚•πyes...‚•πoh
it doesn't work the same
how do you enable the developer console in safari‚•πit may have to do with the fact that it took 701 ms to do something‚•πum‚•πsee I am more adept than akhil
clearly
so just tell me how to enable developer tools‚•πi mean
the audio‚•πi already have that open‚•πwill download forever
so idk‚•πyeah but like how do you open it
I know they hide it‚•πgo to preferences‚•πokay‚•πthen u gotta go to advanced
then the button for develop mode will be there
click
then go to menu bar
bam developer mode‚•πso in safari‚•πdef
def there
am I blind‚•πit shows the stop button
but no audio‚•πthe last thing
says develop‚•πah yes
im stupid
ty‚•πthis?
or is it greyed out‚•πor i just stop being an idiot
wait
i can get safari on linux‚•πgrey‚•πoh grey
hmm
i think its the same as the firefox issue
which i cant figure out‚•πworks fine
in webkit‚•πthis is quite weird
it is on and off‚•πsend me the firefox error‚•πand Ramesh seems to not encounter issues‚•πThis is linux "safari"‚•πbut it only‚•πYea same as me‚•πlike‚•πoh it loads forever‚•πit only happens when you reload
it works the first time
then stops working
when you reload
in firefox‚•πnothing in mac safari‚•πfor me‚•πyea thats what i said‚•πit works okay in firefox
better than mac safari‚•πwhy is this so annoying‚•πit works in epiphany tho‚•πimma have to add
another compatibility message
to solve this problem‚•πsafari its just loading forerver‚•πI have to scan my apush notes‚•πlike forever forever‚•πyep same on epiphany
but not on REAL safari‚•πsee i should do those now
im on REAL safari
its also just loading forever‚•π*sigh
just
use
chrome‚•πno.‚•πwhy
do people
use‚•πsafari uses less battery life‚•πnot chrome‚•πon macbooks‚•π^‚•πlike‚•πand its synced with my passwords‚•πyou care about that‚•πthen base safari on blink‚•πwhen ur plugged in
give google a monopoly‚•πor‚•πI can somewhat support safari‚•πmake a consortium‚•πno
that exists‚•πcuz this is ridiculous‚•πit's called the w3c‚•πthey're not good enough
clearly‚•πyeah uh huh‚•πnow heres a question
akhil‚•πalso the safari might be greyed out on mine‚•πin safari‚•πsince mac over vnc sucks‚•πyeah blame the consortium‚•πakhil‚•πyea‚•πin safari
go to the console
and type‚•πmhm

my icons
asd;flkja;sdlkfj
dammit windows
ah right i remember now
the icons disappear when i run out of ram
cuz windows thinks theyre unimportant
now why
is‚•πthen stop using so much ram
also i dont wanna study for chemn‚•πwho the f
is using 43gb of ram
what
is this
i cant even use my clipboard
to send screenshots anymore‚•πwho‚•πalright so what i have 4 different browsers open
thats only like 6gb of ram
how
43gb committed
there it finally did a screenshot
hmm
well
i could just expand my swap
that would solve the issue‚•π....‚•πi could also add a compatibility message‚•πI do not understand how u use like 43 gb of ram‚•πme neither‚•πAt most like ive used 15 gb‚•πhow to solve all problems‚•πSure‚•πsee im not actually running that much
*cough
actually
thats not true‚•πWhat did we do this chapter in chem?
Balancing
Limiting v excess
Percent yield
Wtf
U know u should close things right
Like when ur done with them‚•πi should ask for more ram for christmas
i should not close things‚•πU should not not close things‚•πthe problem is that like
now my taskbar is running out of space too
so i need a wider monitor‚•π.......
Windows vertical tabs?‚•πwindows has a vertical mode
except
its awful
bc you have to click the little arrows
alternatively i could use multiple desktops
imma increase my swap‚•πSure go ahead‚•πow oops
i just set my swap to 32 megabytes
just add a couple orders of magnitude...‚•πnice‚•πnow it wants me to restart
but
guess what
my icons are back
so as far as i see‚•πnice‚•πthis is a win
i still do not understand though
what is taking 43gb of memory‚•πBalancing, Relationships, Yield, Limiting vs Excess reactants
look at the tasks
What ch 4 in chem is for the test‚•πi think its all that
it must be nginx‚•πah i see the prob now‚•πwhat‚•πits not one thing thats taking up a lot‚•π43 gb akhil‚•πits a bunch of ‚Äúsmaller‚Äù ones‚•πmore than half of the small ones are under 10mb‚•πthen yeah its prob nginx‚•πhmm
so does this mean
nginx does things with memory?
what is it doing
caching a literal audio stream?
maybe its using the memory for compression
ik compression uses a lot of memory
wanna listen to some electro swing
oh it ended
now its Young Hearts by BUNT. ft BEGINNERS
this is what my code would be obfuscated
tf
"Sound is using your microphone"‚•πis this electro swing‚•πit is not

you can erase vlc‚•πok‚•πk so butt is actually really easy to use
its really ugly
but it works
download
run
and send screenshot
this will work
k go to settings‚•πok‚•πunder main, server
click add‚•πyea‚•πgive it some random name
icecast
port 8880
password hackme
mountpoint example.ogg
user source
then‚•πok‚•πonce done
click add
to close that box‚•πok‚•πthen under audio
set codec to OGG/VORBIS‚•πbitrate?‚•π128k‚•πok‚•πunder streaming
then go back to the main window
and click play
then send a screenshot
no
you clicked record
you need to click play
i dont think ur mic works
set your audio device in settings
stop
play
then screenshot
idk im not picking up a stream
and i see not level meters
like in mine\
make it so there are level meters
i think ur mic is blocked or dead‚•πi did something‚•πwait
i hear it
i hear it
oh
thats fine
i can still hear you
you know what would be fun
if ur website had the same thing
then we could talk
like rtc
but like not at all rtc
yes ik
whats the latency like
say something
that was like 12s
yes
like
but its high quality
you could use this for broadcasts though
like
ok...
im getting lost in latency
virtual disk 6 5 4 3 2 1
sure
mine sounds better
k so now open the stream on a speaker
to create the creepy echo
it is not complete
without the creepy echo
would you like
to listen to akhil
aw hes not there
and ur reaction is 12s delayed
this is so fun idk why
remember when like
you were small
and you tried to talk with friends
over walkie talkies
bc u didn't have a phone
its so fun waiting what seems like 30 seconds now
for u to respond
now all i need is this
but with video broadcasts
alright im starting to get a headache‚•πmay i get rid of the software now?‚•πsure
but the quality was outstanding
and for how simple
this is
its like‚•πhandbrake?‚•πno
icecast‚•πgive me your stream link‚•πi wanna propose to my brothers piano teacher to use icecast
oh you wanna stream now‚•πno
i wanna show you something‚•πwdym‚•πoh no‚•πbut its not live
well yes
but‚•π404‚•πum
yea
thats because‚•πwhatever
it's okay‚•πthis‚•πjust curious, where do yall store ur photos and stuff‚•πwhat photos‚•πany photos‚•πlike the ones i take?‚•πyes
like camera photos‚•πon google photos, OneDrive, nextcloud, and on my sd card‚•πi should do that
i dont use my sd card that much anyway‚•πno my phone sd card‚•πill take it from the rpi and put it on that‚•πi dont use a camera much‚•πyea idc
or ill put them in nextcloud
i finished studying for chem
its like 7 questions tmrw
and 3-5 parts
which is easy‚•πthe like
one
icecast broadcast client
for android‚•πLooks so stupid
Make ur own‚•πlike the "quality level"
max kwalitee
-0.1‚•πOo‚•πi could‚•πI mean mine was like -0.5‚•πbut android and ios
are pain in the broadcast using this tool
(butt)
and if it works
it works‚•πlowercase c‚•πk
see i wanna get my brother's piano teacher to use icecast
for recitals
and more
cuz its so much better than zoom
and theres an ios app
thats really good
its literally
5 boxes for each of the params
and an on button
and i tried it
and it works
well
so each performer would simply type these things in
and then when it's their turn
they would click on‚•πI mean theoretically they could‚•πand the listeners would reload
you do not understand
how bad zoom is
with piano
its like‚•πNo i do‚•πaudible
and perceivable‚•πMy sister learns the piano‚•πbut
like‚•πU know whats worse
The drums
On zoom‚•πyeah
no
thats
yea
anyway
cuz right now my radio system is on a 90 day death timer
when my cert expires
and i dont know how to renew it
its probably just like certbot renew
but like
as if i will remember‚•πDo ssl‚•πi mean
it depends
the problem with ssl
is i need certbot to autorenew
and certbot is not fun
because
it requires access to port 80‚•πAh‚•πso
either you stop ur server‚•πCant u send an email and it will renew?‚•πno it actually needs to update everything
and re verify your authority‚•πAh‚•πso either you stop ur server
let it update
then start your server
or
you use a plugin for your web server
that routes certain paths to certbot
which i could do
see‚•πU could‚•πi want an actual computer to run all this
my pi 4
just like
isnt fast enough
to run 4 web services
my global reverse proxy
2 mqtt servers
and an icecast server‚•πFirst off nice
Second ummmmmmmm yea
I feel bad for ur pi‚•πme too
but it has a fan‚•πSecond how do u do this?
I wanna make a reverse proxy‚•πok so
what do you perceive as my meaning of "global reverse proxy"‚•πThe thingy for email servers and stuff‚•πits where all the requests go
they come in
they go there
then
they are routed
its sorta like
a router
but backwards‚•πIsnt that just a normal proxy‚•πyes
but
this is called a reverse proxy
i think
its because
its "clients"
are other servers
accepting inbound requests
sort of
its a 2 way proxy
like‚•πYea i get what ur saying‚•πwell
actually no
it does not place requests
to wherever you want
those are fixed
regardless of the name
this server‚•πIt receives them‚•πyes
well but it also places them
on other servers on your network
but anyway
it takes everything that comes in
and sorts it
and reroutes it
and for the static stuff
it also acts as a web server
in fact
it can be your entire web server
like apache i believe‚•πfyi
certbot autorenews‚•πruns on nginx
yes
unless
something else is on port 80
idk about email yet
but you see
what would happen would be that like‚•πdid akhil start WoR‚•πin addition to a global reverse proxy and static hosting server
there would be another server
responsible for hosting things
like web services
mqtt
icecast
telegram bots
loggers‚•πare those running on the same ports‚•πand stuff like that‚•πyeah well then you just buy a server
I have a few for sale fyi‚•πyes i know fmi‚•πwhat does FMI mean
h‚•πfor my informaion‚•πAh int√©ressant‚•πbut i have a few issues
so you see
i want
to have nginx route
everything
from a port 443 request
to its intended server
so like
it passes everything including the ssl and encryption and everything
to the server‚•πto
your mqtt server
that doesn't support encryption?‚•πno
to my nextcloud server
so
i have a nextcloud server
with encryption
that is self-managing
and what i want
to be routed ssl and all
to that server
so the global reverse proxy does no ssl‚•πthat is just like
not how that works
i dunno
ive never done such a thing before
I manage ssl on my reverse proxy
it's slightly easier that way‚•πsee ramesh
how does certbot work for you‚•πI think
what you want
is to port forward
not reverse proxy‚•πyes
but no
bc that is what i have now
but i want multiple servers in my house on port 443 on my external port 443
also this
how does it autorenew
if your site is using port 80‚•πI have no clue
I know on NixOS it uses like
a systemd timer‚•πand then it kills your server?‚•πfor like
2 seconds
and then it restarts and works fine‚•πhmm
but what if i have servers that cannot be killed‚•πwdym‚•πi guess you use the plugin‚•πthe plugin‚•πalso
ramesh‚•πrestarts nginx‚•πno
it uses nginx to route special requests
to certbot‚•πthen
it autoupdates your nginx config
and reloads nginx
or restarts it‚•πthat is true
actually‚•πthat's what I mean‚•πyeah so thats fine i guess
ok i have another question
so what if i have multiple servers on port 80 on one os
want to have*‚•πyou don't do that‚•πbut like‚•πlike you can't‚•πwhat if i want 3 mqtt servers
on one computer‚•πuse
different ports‚•πbut what if i cant change the port‚•πwhy‚•πidk but what if i cant‚•πthen you like use VMs‚•πi see
what about containerization
what is docker‚•πno‚•πplease explain‚•πdocker doesn't
work like that‚•πwell regardless
what is it‚•πactually i guess docker could work
docker is like it runs in a network that is only accessible to the local machine
and is more lightweight than vms‚•πwhat does it do tho
like‚•πit runs containers‚•πhow does it work
what is a container‚•πa lightweight vm
like
it's not even a vm
it uses the host kernel
and just has like different files on top of it‚•πwhat is not shared between containers‚•πand you can run multiple
files
files‚•πso its literally a folder‚•πit's like
a rootfs‚•πidk what that is ramesh‚•πuh
it's the root filesystem
all the files contained in it at /‚•πyes obviously‚•πthat's bad
yeah that's all it is I think
and then it runs those separately‚•πso
hold on‚•πwith separate network‚•πso it runs with a separate /
and its own netowrk
then you use docker‚•πyes‚•πto manage the network
and the ports‚•πno
oh uh yes
i guess
what do you mean by manage network and ports‚•πso you would use docker to "port forward"
requests to different containers
so each container would have an mqtt server
and then docker would route the ports‚•πno
how would you even distinguish
which things to route to which server‚•πlike this
so‚•πYes‚•πrequest would come into nginx‚•πyour
MQTT
request
comes into nginx‚•πthen nginx would route to a specific port‚•πa port‚•πbased on the domain
then‚•πa port
so this is like all one server
okay‚•πan address:port‚•πokay‚•πthen
at that address would be docker
and it would look at the port
"8001, oh, thats mq01"
then‚•πSee if thats what u want‚•πdocker
would route port 8001‚•πyes‚•πto port 8000‚•πyou can do that‚•πon the respective container‚•πYes‚•πI think you can do that
I'm pretty sure you can do that‚•π^
Has everything u can and cannot do
So‚•πso you can do
what i want to do
k
great
so now when should i choose vm over container
or container over vm‚•πIsolation
A whole new os‚•πgive me an example
of when vm would be better‚•πFor when i wanna use kali linux on my mac‚•πuhm
the reason you use a vm‚•πno when container would be an option but vm would be better‚•πis because docker is an annoying piece of garbage
it is ephemeral‚•πwhat does this mean‚•πit disappears
like‚•πwdym‚•πthe data it has
disappears when it shuts down‚•πwhy‚•πso you need to allocate certain parts of it
to like have permanent storage‚•πand it would dothat‚•πyes‚•πand the rest
would be copied from the host os‚•πall new again when you restart the vm‚•πso
when you boot
it copies the hosts stuff
to the container
then
the container can edit it independently of the host
but when you reboot
it erases that
and copies it from the host again‚•πyeah I guess that works as a valid explanation‚•πso
a docker "container"
can be "shipped"
what does this mean‚•πdunno‚•πi think its like
it can be transported
so i could create one on my pc
then
package it
and ship it‚•πyes‚•πto my server‚•πdocker registry is for that‚•πah a docker "image"
so what does this mean
as an example‚•πit's an image
you can use the image and configure its environment variables and whatnot
and then you run it‚•πwould the image
already say what should be kept permanent
what does the image already say
without my help‚•πno you have to say what gets kept permanent
because you have to specify where docker stores those permanent files‚•πi see
hi ramesh
what is kubernetes‚•πjust dont venture near kubernetes
unless you want nightmares‚•πwhy
i want nightmares‚•πit is horrible‚•πso heres my bigger question
how do you do horizontal scaling‚•πkubernetes is a complicated version of docker
that is overly complicated
you mean like load balancing‚•πyea‚•πthen I think you need
kubernetes
the worst abomination‚•πalright
so what is kubernetes‚•πit's meant for that
look
I have work to do
google it
I will tell you later‚•πok
i can also ask my 4h club member
he knows
Visvam
he did kubernetes
see i missed the first minute
cuz i was mystified by his light board‚•πI can't
I just lost it with this one‚•πsee what i dont understand is like
if you are netflix
where
is your request going
where are they going
they need to output hundreds of terabits per second
how is that balanced
surely not all connections come through one line
and surely not all of them are managed by one global reverse proxy‚•πProbably the same way with youtube‚•πlike i just dont understand
how you scale
like that
meh i dont need to scale
in fact i need to do the opposite of horizontal scaling
i need to do inverse horizontal scaling
running multiple services on one hardware
so imma not worry about this
now i need to know‚•πIsnt Netflix like torrents‚•πwhat are good specs for a global reverse proxy server‚•πIt has like a billion servers and grabs the one nearest to u
Idk
I feel anything would work‚•πno i want a good one‚•πAs long as its got a solid internet connection‚•πthat doesn't get bottlenecked‚•πthey use load balancers probably
also netflix uses freebsd‚•πramesh‚•πno‚•πwhat are good specs for a global reverse proxy server
and static web host server
to run nginx
i mean
i could just like
run it all on one server
regardless i need a method of easily dealing with running lots of web servers right now
i could just put them all on the pi
its not dead yet
hmm
hmm
maybe my pi can take a bit more
and now suddenly networking is working‚•πthird use of "lol:"
indicate awkwardness‚•πiperf wont work‚•π„Åô„Åø„Åæ„Åõ„Çì‚•πwhen you run iperf
which way does the data do‚•πI hav like 1500 messages‚•πyou choose
the server and the client
it goes from the client to the server
Ô¨Å‚•πbe‚•πuh
is this romanian
a Ô¨Å‚•πa Ô¨Å‚•πÔ¨Å‚•πbe‚•πcool‚•πI am not happy
I am wearing a mask
And for some reason
I can't breathe comfortably today‚•πOof‚•πIt's like
I've been running
And I'm out of breath‚•πHuh‚•πBut I have a mask on
And it stops me from breathing‚•πThe big sad‚•πMove ur mask off and see if u can breath better
I can run with a mask on‚•πIdk mask is usually fine‚•πLike it feels like normal‚•πJust today
For some reason
I feel like I'm being deprived of oxygen
I'm going all virtual next week I think
I do not enjoy this
And Michael and akash left me
I am going to class
Good day‚•πI hav to quarantine to see grandma for Christmas‚•πoooo
yea thats goood
cy stay at home
yes
i like strapping stuff to my head‚•πyou don't understand
I think
see
i was on zoom during science
for the test
on my phone
and i think zoom
caused my phone to kernel panick
like‚•π?‚•πthe phone just stopped
it froze completely
it was stuck on an upside down picture of me taking a test
it was disconnected from my watch
would not turn off
or on
and was mildly  warm‚•πhuh‚•πUsually masks are fine
especially in winter
because they heat up my face
Has anyone noticed this as well?
I might just take to wearing a mask during winter‚•πhahaha
to prevent scalpers right‚•πYes
Yes
During drama club‚•πwhat if someone made a bot, to complete the captchas‚•πIt was not a bad thing
Outside in 4¬∞
To have a mask
I'm in advisory
Bye‚•πwhy is everyone talking about cyberpunk 2077‚•πcause
it got released today
and its by cd project red
so its gonna be a decent game‚•πmm
it also works on linux apparently‚•πsupposedly it has a lot of bugs rn but thats about what i expect
yeah its a big game
i forgot to say Keanu Reeves did mocap and stuff for the game
thats also why it got big‚•πwhat is mocap‚•πmotion capture
where he puts on a suit and special cameras record the suit data to create realitic motion and movement
cause he has a character in the game‚•πOh I see‚•πim excited
cant play it till christmas, but idrc‚•πwhy
theres no way your comp will even support it‚•πwho says im playing on comp
im not stupid
i have an xbox that im gonna be playing on‚•πhow
will your xbox one
support it‚•πr u dumb
its a AAA game
that means Xbox, PS, comp‚•πxb series x and s maybe‚•πno
Xbox one, Series X|S, PS4, PS5
the game started development WAYYYY before the series X|S came out‚•πoh I see‚•πi wont get fancy mirrors
and windows but its still gonna look pretty good
im prob gonna spend like 5 hours on character creation alone‚•πwhy not get it now‚•πi will
ill have it in like 3-4 hours
im just not gonna play till christmas
otherwise i wont enjoy it‚•πwdym have it in a few hours‚•πIm gonna have the game in a few hours‚•πI mean it's kinda like my getting RoW and starting it 2 weeks later
parents are taking a trip to best buy?‚•πNope
Amazon‚•πoh fun‚•πYup
Yea‚•πRoW is a good book btw
did you start WoR‚•πI will tmrw
Yesterday i found out i had an animation project outstanding‚•πWonderful
today I found out I have an
apush test
tomorrow‚•πquiz
mc
tests next week
hmm, i should study as well‚•πI'm not
I'm ready to read the flashback perspective in RoW

I though u got the mail server working
I got really excited for a moment‚•πwell
its like
compiling
but i found a better guide
so imma follow it‚•πCompiling?‚•πyeah for some reason theyre like
dont use precompiled binaries
on rpi
theres this setup script
that like
does everything for you
and automatically deals with compiling
and dependencies
and setup‚•πHuh‚•πso im running it
but its taking a hot minute
but its like
compiling
on a pi
so
im still not using more than 200mb of ram
on the pi‚•πAlacritty: exists
Cy:‚•πwhat does
"Alacritty"
give me‚•πmultiplexing if used with tmux
blur possibly
gpu acceleration‚•πthat i dont have‚•πmeaning that programs objectively run faster
you would literally notice
the difference‚•πwhat
uses the gpu‚•πthe terminal program‚•πbut how does like
how do u just
use the gpu‚•πOpenGL‚•πk but what if what im running doesn't use the gpu
like
if im running
openssh
or ngrok
or the c compiler
like
everything
i run‚•πno like the text display
uses the gpu‚•πthe text display
uses the gpu
why
why‚•πit's faster‚•πramesh‚•πnoticeably
you can feel it
sensory feedback‚•πdo i look like i need gpu acceleration‚•πyes‚•πon my terminal text‚•πgiven that you are cy
you are cy‚•πi do not understand
how
why
my terminal
needs gpu acceleration
maybe you linux ppl with unoptimized apps
that run poorly‚•πread the link i sent you‚•πwhy though
what is a
"terminal benchmark"
this makes
litrally no sense
fine fine ill download it‚•πyou will hate it
it doesn't have a gui
you have to configure it with a text file
and it doesn't have tabs natively
you have to use tmux‚•πwindows terminal is the same‚•πTmux is nice‚•πand it has tabs by default
as well as panes
and
it probably also uses this fancy gpu acceleration
and it has blur
and therefore
it is better
i dont wanna install some random thing it wants me to install‚•πidk if blur works
also‚•πwhat‚•πthat might be a linux-only feature‚•πwhat
the blur?‚•πyes‚•πlook
imma use windows terminal
cuz its fast
and fine‚•πyeah ok look i wanna read
i have 30 minutes before I have to start studying for my APUSH quiz
bye‚•πbye
server shutdown. When? now.
but
its not
like
idk i think im close
im getting closer
it exists now‚•πAch mein Gott!‚•πOh my God!‚•πwhy is my mail server not working‚•πIdk
Did i search for this no
Did i watch it yes
Am I satisfied yes‚•πdid i watch this like 2 years ago yes
so you see my email server
is not sending or recieving mail
which
as you might imagine
is not ideal‚•πHmm maybe thats for the best‚•πcan you
find me
a tutorial
on citadel
that is not one
i have already seen‚•πRn no, later/tmrw yes‚•πk
well
i just received a message
from like
5:30
*sigh
k so it is recieving mail
but not sending
and idk why
and i need to stop
but i am now hooked on getting this to work
spam is fun‚•πI saw those, and the Sam time video, the retards will still buy this piece of junk‚•πIkr
Look at those comments tho
Explains them perfectly
I get reviewers buying em cause thats their job
Anybody else like why‚•πYuh
Honestly apple stock is looking more favorable
I dont like the company but God there marketing is good
L-1 min
Sry 4 min‚•πOo
Hell yes
They made that stupid case look half decent‚•πYea its literally a bra for the headphone
As quoted by samtime‚•πHaha
Idk i think the headphones are utterly ridiculous
like each earcup themselves are worth like 200$
thats the price of qc 35
i can get to qc35 for the price of one airpods pro max‚•π2
idk theyre apple hedfones
they are a part of the brand
the image
the luxury image
the high-tech luxury image
which apple aims to portray
and some people
really like
so
they are right at home
with the wheels
and the stand
and the gold watches‚•πIt was true in the days of jobs
They were good‚•πno its still true
its like
a luxury product‚•πBut Apple used to b good‚•πwith a focus on technology
as well as style
and design
and brand‚•πi only like the cups on those headphones‚•πYea but today those are irrelevant‚•πthey look comfy‚•πi dont like that design
its too
like
not
ok‚•πdesign sucks‚•πCook is riding on the wave on f
Jobs‚•πbut‚•πyes‚•πthe design is quite unique
and
it will be iconic‚•πyes its something ‚Äúnew"‚•πand stand out
so that ppl will notice
as with luxury products
they want to stand out‚•πI'm interested in the hedband part
Head‚•πyea‚•πThat might prove rly good‚•πill wait for mkbhd review on them
or linus tech tips‚•πDef ltt‚•πidk
i want hedphones
cuz you see
right now
on what
oh right‚•πOn what‚•πlate February‚•πI dont pay attention to this cjst‚•πearly march‚•πChat‚•πwhen do u think our school will have 100 of these headphones
like 100 kids will have the headphones‚•πAfter Christmas
Filled‚•πme and cy said late feb‚•πyknow what i bet‚•πalright‚•πI say early January‚•πyknow how like
matt
walked around in the skool
with hedphones
he looked cool with hedphones
right‚•πyea‚•πYuh‚•πso like
ppl will want to do that
but they only buy apple‚•πis everyone just gonna be walking around with these‚•πso they had airpods
but like
now
they will walk with these‚•πok airpods i will admit i just wear cause they are convenient and i have them‚•πIts a matter of when not iff
If‚•πbut these will look so stupid‚•πthey will grow on you
you will see‚•πWalking with headphones is stupid‚•πif u look cool in them go ahead
if ur like the rest of us, dont‚•πYe‚•πi want over ear headphones
that sound good‚•πthose r the only good ones‚•πI have good boes ones‚•πwhich ones‚•πIdk I hav to look, I barely use them‚•πtell me wich modil‚•πi like my bose headphones
what were u earbuds called again?‚•πthe hackja ones‚•πu know the cool ones
and my headphone‚•π?
do you mean the hackja ones‚•πur NC ones‚•πqc comfort something
i forgot‚•πi have QC 15 at home‚•πgalox buds sound good
but like
idk‚•πairpods also sound decent‚•πgalox buds are flat
they are not u like most
they are flat
-‚•πcant u change the eq‚•πwell yea
but
with no eq
they are flat
and like
the mids
actually sound
present‚•πthis would kill me if they were flat‚•πwhy‚•πeven know i have to like eq spotify
i like my bass‚•πthey have bass
its just like
not dominant‚•πi need it to be very present‚•πi mean the non wireless galaxy headphones
on those
the bass
dominates all
and its clear
and crisp‚•πthat good‚•πbut the mids
are not quite
what i want them to be‚•πi wish they allowed u to like full eq it
like get the chart and do fun stuff‚•πwdym‚•πlike my jaybirds
u know how i can eq the heck out of it
oh
damn airpods dont do anything fun‚•πno thats just a Samsung feature‚•πwait i can ‚Äúeq‚Äù it‚•πfor all hedphones plugged in
or connected‚•πthats still good‚•πin fact‚•πi lost my eq when i unjailbroke‚•πspotify
on android
has no eq feature
it just directs you to that page‚•πhuh‚•πi just wish it were easier to get to
or if there was a quick toggle for it‚•πi mean at least u can eq it

I'm
the host of my meeting‚•πThe school is fun
Without zoom‚•πHuh
Thats nice‚•πSomeone must have hacked fortinet‚•πWait that means teachers cant zoom‚•πYes
Unless they use hotspot‚•πWhich means classes r not happening‚•πWhich they are not allowed to
Or
They can use google meet‚•πWait damn it my teacher is at home‚•πI hope‚•πHa‚•πthat gym gets cancelled‚•πIdk they are working on this issue‚•πDo my special skill‚•πFrankly

Who's video is this
Also‚•πwhen I went to the SAT‚•πAh
They unblocked all .ios‚•πYAY
:D
I knew it
I also went to other .ios and it worked fine
why did they  unblock them‚•πBut they still block anything that they consider "proxy avoidance"
So essentially
It's a firewall‚•πwhat about WireGuard‚•πWhose only purpose‚•πis blocking vpns‚•πIs to prevent people‚•πso they can monitor
your traffic‚•πFrom circumventing it
I haven't tried wireguard‚•πthis
there are firewall avoidance vpns
people use it in china‚•πOpenvpn works on tcp 443
Only on android‚•πwhat about‚•πI tested last year‚•πxvideo and other sexually explicit websites‚•πImma not go to them‚•πAw
I was gonna ask you to try‚•πGot the new Google assistant‚•πOooo looks nice‚•πthat was... fast‚•πWhy does it turn red?‚•πIt's cuz google wants to see what's on my screen
But also
The screen recorder wants to see it
So it conflicts
I think‚•πSo it doesnt look like that when ur not recording?‚•πYea
When I'm not recording it's fine‚•πThats pretty nice
Its quick as well‚•πIt used to be faster tho
There's also a new bixby
Bixby is like blazing fast‚•πyeah does Akhil like cuddling girls‚•πBut it wouldn't let me record audio‚•πI'm making a bot for samantha
Bots don't need phone verification‚•πWhere

What is it‚•πWhat type of question is this‚•πRamesh-type‚•πIdek anymore
Why?
Yay
^‚•πSee pic 1 is default camera app
Pic 2 is telegram built in camera‚•πIts garbage‚•πYes‚•πIsnt this cause some android thing‚•πYea‚•πPretty sure i dont have that much of a difference‚•πWhat aio should I get‚•πBruh offload ur images and videos
There is no way u need 40gb if videos‚•πI don't have enough space on my card‚•πInstall it on a flash drive
Hold on
U have 70gb of videos
Why‚•πI wike videowez‚•πClearly
Well at least u still have space‚•πNot for installing apps‚•πI would get those 70gb videos off ur phone and somewhere else‚•πI can move apps to the SD card
No
I want them all
Right here‚•πU cant install onto the SD card?
........
U know what sure‚•πYes but there's not enough space‚•πI have no use for videos‚•πSo I need a bigger card
They are more real‚•π1tb sd card?‚•πLike
When you look back
The moments on video‚•πEhh i prefer my pictures‚•πAre way more clear
Than those in stills
So I take videos‚•π4k 60?‚•πNo 1080p30‚•πAwwww‚•πMost of them
Or maybe 4k30
Idk‚•πI do film quality‚•πThe resolution doesn't matter much for most things‚•πI mean yea‚•πI have 21:9 4k 24
In my camera app‚•πHuh
I have 4k 30 but idk the ratio
Fancy‚•πcy

but its like
not exactly a range extender‚•πFios internet is god‚•πcuz its not wireless
its connected to the router over coax‚•πGoogle fiber would also be cool
I mean thats just an AP then‚•πyea
a coax AP‚•πThose r cool
Whats the point of coax‚•πfios sets up an IP over Coax connection in ur house
cuz like
most houses dont have ethernet
but they have coax
which has fairly high bandwidth
probably about 1gbps max
and then the Fios STBs can access the internet for On Demand Content‚•πOooo thats good‚•πfor all connections total
unlike ethernet which is per connection
since on the coax network
all devices are on the same wire
wire
not cable‚•πHuh‚•πits one wire
+ground
its one shielded wire‚•πHuh
Youtube is great
The algorithm is great
Thats good‚•πSEE!

ghana domains‚•πYea its 218$‚•πoooh
lovely‚•πsee
, envMap: scene.background

from the sfears
the thing about three.js tho is you have to do testing on an actual server
cuz it gets mad‚•πhuh

that
is what is making it happen
cuz i wanna reflekshins‚•πmake them a different color and make a single color background

but getting close‚•πwhat does this even mean
WELP guess what im reading next
warbreaker
i thought id be done with these books‚•πthe sfears arent

they are like

that was the 200kb auto Bluetooth preview version

Right.‚•πwhat a coincidence

ima goin to kemistry‚•πcalculus teacher didn't start the meeting yet
sadge‚•πSee I want to have an impact
I want to make something that is relevant
to people
there was this thing
my mom showed me
saying that
the only real way to find what matters to ppl
is to ask them
many of them
I want to survey a large group of ppl
and find out
what they want‚•πhello‚•πhi
I want to survey a large group of ppl
who
should i survey‚•πidk
depends on what u wanna do‚•πwdym‚•πu want something relevant right‚•πi want an idea that doesn't come from my head
it comes
from the heads
of ppl‚•πwell there are two types of seeable relevances imo‚•πwho are actually wanting
the solution
Xplane‚•πthe older generation, and the younger one‚•πso like
teachers‚•πthe older generation will want something vastly different then the younger generatuion‚•πand students‚•πwell yes, but lets expand and say people in the workforce and dependents‚•πok...‚•πso u have dependents which are the elderly and the young, and people who are in the workforce‚•πyes
but that's a little more broad than i was thinking
by a large group of ppl
i meant like 100-1000‚•πdepends on what u wanna do‚•πweb stuff prob‚•πthen u can prob just take any 1000 people off the street/in the town and ask them
but with 100-1000 people its gonna be something local‚•πsee i wanted you to say like
teachers
that way
like
cuz‚•πand even within that 1000 people there will be vast differences‚•πthat's what i was thinking‚•πteachers
the thing with teachers is‚•πwell you see i wanted you to say that
without me prompting you‚•πthey can get anything they want‚•πthat way
like
wdym‚•πthe ‚Äúmarket‚Äù is big
there are a lot of teachers‚•πno at ridge‚•πand teachers support the younger generation‚•πnot all the teachers in …ôm…ôr…ôc…ô‚•πwhat would teachers at ridge need specifically
if u could name a few things then yes survey teachers‚•πthat's exactly the question
i do not know
that's why
i want to survey them‚•πthen go ahead, there are like 200 teachers in the school right?‚•πbut the reason i wanted you to say teachers
is that
i wasnt sure if this was like
some weird idea
that's just weird‚•πits not
it may be a cliched group of people
but its not weird‚•πno but that's kinda the point
you dont make something for everyone
thats what google and amazon are doing
you make something
for the ppl who have been excluded
from google and amazon
ppl for whom the general system does not work fully‚•πare teachers really excluded though‚•πthey do not have to be "excluded"
but like
im sure
theres something
they want
that google isnt giving them
but that can be done
like
something thats not profitable large-scale
but very useful
at the level of ridge teachers‚•πthen yea u can find a method of surveying them
i personally feel that the teachers at ridge have everything they need‚•πbut ur not one of them
so you dont know‚•πyea thats my point as a student‚•πsee the thing my mom showed me is like‚•πpretty sure u cant mail all the teachers‚•πthis person
was like
so
they are the head of a company
that starts companies
so they created like
several
such as this marriage service for homosexuals
and
MongoDB
and they created these by asking ppl about their problems
they thought everything was fine
but then they asked 300 ppl
if they were having problems
and several of these ppl
brought up their issues
and they were able to start successful companies out of these ideas
so the idea is like
you ask all the teachers
what could be better
and they tell you
well, i want a better form of webassign.
i want an easier attendance system.
i want ________
and you find the things
that they say in common
you see patterns
and then you create something
that solves their problem
and present it to them
you provide outreach and produce impact
its not like some random thing thats kinda funny not really very useful that no one cares about
like most of my projects
i wanna try something
or anyone really‚•πuh sure‚•πjoin "space"
with link
sent‚•πuh sure‚•πgo to wink‚•πi am waiting in the lobby‚•πrewoad‚•πi mean yea u could do this, but ill play devils advocate for some of the examples that u give‚•πk...‚•πwebassign is by cengage, an actual company which aslo ties into the textbook‚•πyes
but
lemme tell u something‚•πso teachers are not just gonna switch, also from my teachers experience he doesnt mind webassign‚•πlemme tell u somehting‚•πwut‚•πi talked to dr pernia
and he said
that is really very difficult to make questions
he would make them himself‚•π‰ªäÊó•„ÅØ„Åæ„Çã„ÅßÊò®Êó•„Åø„Åü„ÅÑ„Å†‚•πToday is like yesterday‚•πbut its too hard‚•πhmm
interesting‚•πso he uses the textbook‚•πsong lyric ofc‚•πthe built in ones
and so you see
if it were easier to make questions
then maybe it would not need ties to the textbook
though teachers are fine with webassign‚•πhmm mabye‚•πi dont think theres a need to reinvent the wheel there‚•πi mean this.....
its kinda tied in with genesis so‚•πwell but
my health teacher
always has trouble with figuring out whos absent
quickly
and easily
she rn
is using a google classroom assignment
and everyone has to submit it before 5 mins into class‚•πuh wut?‚•πwa katteiru wa katteiru kerero‚•πour teacher just either looks at the participants tab or just calls out names out‚•πwa katteiru wa katteiru kerero‚•πha.
use transliterations‚•πparticipants is first name ordered
and it tells you who's there
not whos not
genesis
wants whos not there
and in last name order‚•πidk our teacher does quick attendance‚•πso for smaller classes
its ok
also especially if all the students are there‚•πwell that too
ur health teacher has a clase of 30+‚•πbut anyway
idk if these are real issues‚•πfar greater than most of the teachers outside the subject field‚•πi would have to survey to find out‚•πu should ask teachers‚•πnaneun akil igo neteufeurikeuseuleul saranghae‚•πsee - survey‚•πneoneun akil igo neteufeurikeuseuleul saranghae‚•πuse a google form, and then ask ur ap seminar as research‚•π?‚•πÎÇòÎäî ÏïÑÌÇ¨ Ïù¥Í≥† ÎÑ§Ìä∏ÌîÑÎ¶¨ÌÅ¨Ïä§Î•º ÏÇ¨ÎûëÌï¥‚•πI'm Achill and I love Netfrikes‚•πnetflix
nice‚•πthe ap seminar kids send out forms for the students to fill out as for their research‚•πhmm‚•πu could prob do the same‚•πinteresting
i will contact mr y then

i got 6 upvotes on a single RoW post

I saw a random book series called "Malazan"
on reddit
let me look into whether I should read it‚•πtf is this
k i think im done
with youtube
for today
now be a good student and actually understand the answer
do not copy
copy=not know
not know=bad
for reference
what is RoW‚•πRhythm of War
a book
a good book‚•πi see
should i read it‚•πcy should read
the way of kings
so he can get to rhythm of war which is the fourth book in the series
it is good
this post
says‚•πunlike ramesh
cy
does not‚•π"I hate fantasy books"
but then the person was like‚•πread in his free time‚•π"nvm"‚•πhe should
but he doesnt‚•πtry it
please‚•πi just dont like
kings
and war
and stuff
idk‚•πsigh
have you
read
the stormlight archive
it is
different and better than typical
fantasy books‚•πits still a fantasy book‚•πyou are too biased
you have to read it
before you say
"it's JUST a fantasy book"‚•πwhat is it about‚•πyou can't just put a blanket statement on a brandon sanderson book
that doesn't work
yeah uh the plot is really complex so it has a bunch of plots
so I can't tell you exactly what it's about without literally spoiling it‚•πwho are the main characters‚•πKaladin
Shallan
Dalinar
Jasnah‚•πidc their names‚•πhahahaaha‚•πwho are they
like
what are they‚•πKaladin is a slave
who has to run bridges
meaning
they place bridges on like
sigh how do I explain this
like small island-cliffs for the army to get to the other side‚•πk hes a slave
next‚•πyeah
uh
sigh
uh
Dalinar is a highlord 
Adolin is a highprince
Jasnah is the king's sister
good luck
understanding the terms‚•π*yawn‚•πthat is
because you haven't read it
you have to be
as akhil says
open-minded‚•πi see
what is this book called again‚•πthe way of kings‚•πand where is the ebook‚•πjust like read the prologue‚•πyou dont understand
i thought my nook was dead
after like 3 months
just on‚•πcharge your h*cking kindle‚•πin a corner‚•πyes‚•πit was at 16%‚•πbut ereaders have good battery life‚•πhell yes‚•πin a way
brandon sanderson is h*king intelligent
since‚•πmy kindle lasts like a week‚•πmy nook
lasts
like
forever‚•πto underestand oathbringer's references FULLY you need to have read Mistborn, Elantris, and Warbreaker
but guess what you gotta pay him some money to do that
so hes a genius‚•πbezos‚•πyknow what i dont get
literally numworks‚•πporque‚•πk so you know how they added RTC
gimme one moment‚•πOmega did, its also in beta
not numworks
continue‚•πso how come
this numworks
only lasts 3 days with an rtc
whereas
my nook
with an RTC and literally WiFi
lasts 3 months‚•πthe screen‚•πand the numworks
is doing
nothing
nothing‚•π^‚•πoff‚•π^‚•πit only lasted 3 days
this has got to be
the most CPU intensive
RTC
ever on earth‚•πi mean one way i can think is that its not doing rtc correctly‚•πthese chips are designed to be able to run an rtc for 40 years off a button cell battery‚•πbut ur nook can also just fetch the time whenever it wakes up‚•πthe button cell battery is supposed to kill the human
from chemicals
before they can find
that the rtc has died
and omega
cant make it last more than 3 days
something is amiss‚•πwell try fixing it?‚•πyes but no
it has an offline mode
in which it still keeps the time
anyway‚•π^‚•πi should read the "prologue"
idk how to use their code‚•πoooo is good
my favorite‚•πof the ebook Ramesh sent me‚•πyes
szeth-son-son-vallano‚•πi want to read it on my pc
meh
imma just use my nook‚•πif we can get cy far enough
i get to change the gc name to stormlight trio‚•πi read the "prologue to the stormlight archive"
4 pages
do you understand how long it takes me to read things‚•πwait it was 4 pages?
who was the mc‚•πKalak and Jerizen‚•πread the next chapter‚•π*sigh
i like realistic fiction
i do not like Capitalizedthings
that are made from Twowords
that do not Makesense
ill at least read the first chapter‚•πread
the next chapter
this is the wrong chapter‚•πhes reading the right one‚•πthat's like
he is now?‚•πyea i think so
szeth‚•πokay hopefully that hooks him‚•πSzeth son son vallano‚•πszeth is insane
ly good
Lashings
are cool‚•πi must also read scott fitzgerald for an hour‚•πno
this wont take an hour‚•πyes‚•πregarless of what this takes‚•πits like 20 min‚•πi still need to read scott fitzgerald
for an hour‚•πyes but this ownt take an hour
do it‚•πfor school‚•πit's a good prologue‚•πk‚•πwhy for an hour?‚•πcuz im a slow reader
cuz i have issues‚•πthe great gatsby takes like 20 minutes per chapter‚•πalso i need to read more than one chapter‚•πSzeth-son-son-Vallano‚•π*yawn
no i still dont like fantasy‚•πand why not
also the magic of the story only happens later‚•πno i still dont like fantasy
it gives me a headache
Fantasy, Magic, Gods, Religion
Swords
imma find a different book to read
i like books that delve into the fundamental psychology of humanity
ones that produce nontrivially generalized concepts
from otherwise innate events
im sure this book does that to a certain extent
but i do not wish to have to climb over all of this legend, magic, religion, supernatural, and swords
in order to get to it
therefore
you must like this book for a different reason
you must be searching for this impossible theoretical world
*sigh
what is it with me and culture
movies books and games
i never like what most ppl do
ima eat pita chips‚•πyou don't
need to understand the swords and stuff
there is a STORY to it as well cy
it's not just the worldbuilding
although I really like worldbuilding
how you know samantha bot is working‚•πindeed
the Samantha bot‚•πdo you like to lick socks when socks are in people's feet‚•πthis needs
to end‚•πor just do you like to lick feet without socks‚•πk
so i have brought that to an end
at least for now
as no more such comments
will be permitted
as long as my bot isnt dead again
bonjour‚•πHello‚•πk‚•πIt is definitely Cy
I am Cy
Someone, likely Ramesh, has said something that will not be translated.
I'm definitely Cy and I love to see really cute girls
And I just absolutely positive love stroking them too.
Mind that my English is bad, that doesn't matter! Cute girls are my favourite.‚•πlook
as long
as we are not licking ppl
im good
i wrote a short story
but i will not share it now‚•πI did too‚•πhow short
mine is 350 words‚•πoh
right
wait
mine are much longer than that
twice that
or thrice that‚•πmy story is concise
almost poetic
i will now do an hour of notes for history
good bye‚•πYes, I have seen this before‚•πso now
they are
bouncy
its subtle
but it is there‚•πread
read
it's bad
but like‚•πthis is my short story
what do you think of my short story
i like the imagery in yours
but i dont like fantasy
so i am biased in my overall opinion‚•πit's literally NOT fantasy
please burn your font
change it to times or I'm not reading it‚•πbooks are written in Georgia
not times‚•πDoesn't matter
some
serif font
please‚•πfine‚•πI hate reading sans-serif‚•πthere
does this make you happy
or does it make you sad
because my story
is sad‚•πsad
although it is slightly confusing‚•πyeah its a little
confusing
its all like
inferences‚•πalso my story is fantasy
but
there will be no magic until the second book‚•πno hes in class‚•πNo i here‚•πno read
mine
also cy were you confused by mine‚•πsomewhat‚•πwhat were you confused about‚•πlemme read more of it‚•πum‚•πis good‚•πthe other parts are not in order‚•πconsidering that u said that it was suppose to be sad‚•πits sad tho‚•πwhile reading it i dont feel ‚Äúimpact‚Äù like i can tell its kinda sad
but its not really sad
if u get my drift‚•πsorta‚•πwhat do you think of mine‚•πits about
this person‚•πwait did akhil read‚•πwho dies‚•πmine
yes‚•πno
ill read urs next‚•πno this is mine
i suppose someone dies in urs as well‚•πso tell me what you were confused about
i want to make sure you're confused about the right things
and that I wasn't too vague‚•πim getting harcore SA vibes from urs‚•πyeah it literally
felt
like
the one chapter
that i read
from SA‚•πlol
i agree
it's more the writing style
than the plot‚•πyeah‚•πits not a bad thing‚•πI will see about that‚•πdid
you see‚•πjust so you know‚•πthe new animations‚•πlike
i will
but like I read other books too
remember that book i gave akhil
three dark crowns
i think they do similar things‚•πCourting Darkness?‚•πi wanna read a book that is not fantasy‚•πAh yes‚•πwait did I give you that‚•πso i will find one‚•πi did‚•πuh yeah u did‚•πread
the fault in our stars
by john green‚•πi heard about that‚•πread it it's good
also akhil tell me when you're done reading mine‚•πill read urs later‚•πMattheiu est en ligne
mais il ne parle pas
personne ne parle
tout le monde est silencieux‚•πbut cy
what are you confused about in my story
please‚•πje ne l'est pas encore lit
entierement‚•πd'accord‚•πest-ce tu veux que je le lis maintenant?‚•πnon, c'est bien
tu peux le lire quand tu veux‚•πmeh je ne veux pas faire mes devoirs pour l'histoire maintenant
je vais lire ton histoire‚•π...
d'accord
me dis quand tu as termin√©‚•πi read it
so theres this guy
who doesn't like this other guy
so he goes
to the guy's grain house
and burns it
then
he goes to the guy's house house
and burns it
but
actually
not
because
he forgot his tools in the grain house
and then ppl find him
and kill him
what did you derive from my story‚•πi don't know
honestly
does it make sense‚•πmy story
or yours‚•πmine‚•πyes more or less
how about mine‚•πno
but I like that‚•πits not supposed to‚•πit's a good thing‚•πwhat did you derive from mine
what did you understand‚•πsome guy is dying and depressed
and something weird keeps happening to the soap‚•πhe hides
he spends each night
for an extended period of time
crying
in the shower
without washing
and the soap
symbolizes him‚•πthe foam though
the creamy thing‚•πthat is what happens if you leave soap in steam
for long periods of time
and its fragile
so if you touch it
it will go away‚•π???‚•πbut its still there
so he hasn't touched it‚•πthat's confusing
interesting though‚•πok but in the last paragraph i explain it for you‚•πI will
wait
I made a mistake that contradicts the story's events in T9
since I had not like
planned T9‚•πi must go‚•πI wrote it for something else‚•πto English class‚•πsigh
bye‚•πbye‚•πi wanna learn xcode/flutter/android
but i need an idea‚•πyou should get on board with me
to survey a buncha ppl
so we can get ideas
cuz like
i wanna learn web design
but i need an idea
although if i were you
i would look into bluetooth
cuz its speshul
only mobile apps have axess to this teknoligy
its what makes them Unique
hardware access
like sensors, cameras, BT/BTLE, NFC, and such
I wanna make an ESP button
its just a button that runs on an esp01 module
so you plug it in
and press the button
and it sends an http request or mqtt publish‚•πHmmm
Yea i might do something like those‚•πi might I
?
i see
you mean an ESP buton
or hardware access in apps‚•πYea i might‚•πimma make a pcb for mine
so essentially‚•πDo u mean plug in the esp to the phone?‚•πno
these are different ideas
the esp button
is 3 parts
an esp01
holdon
a carrier board for it
which supplies power and gives it a tactile button
and a nice enclosure
for them‚•πOo‚•πhardware access is different‚•πHmm yea‚•πits like
bluetooth
esp01 doens have bluetooth
it has wi-fi‚•πYea‚•πso its a wifi button‚•πThats kinda cool
Use a wifi button‚•πits like an exercise in PCB design
like a very simple
first step‚•πYea i might try designing a pcb‚•πI see‚•πIm trying to see how those nfc hotel cards work‚•πoh thats simple
they just have an nfc chip in them
u do not make those‚•πSo its a chip‚•πthose are commoditized
what do you want to know about them
i know all about them‚•πIdk I thought it would be cool to design a pcb that has nfc on it‚•πwell you would not be making one of those cards
you would be making a reader
or a transmitter
but not a "tag"
as they are called‚•πHmm i should look up on this‚•πsee
tags are interesting
bc they do not require external power
they are powered wirelessly by the reader
but you just buy tags
and program them
cuz they are really hard to make
yourself‚•πHuh‚•πthey are really easy to make in a factory
with equipment
to embed coils and chips in plastic‚•πis there different things beside tags?‚•πwell like i said there are tags
readers
and transmitters
the phone has a tranciever
it can read and transmit
i want lora
but alas‚•πah lora‚•πno not alas
this is not the end
of my fight to reach lora
je vais manger
a tout a l'heure‚•πyes‚•πWanna build one‚•πI do
But 144 segments
That alot‚•πIdk I'ma do a possibility analysis after I drink a coffee‚•πAlrighty
Coffee break time ig‚•πPita chips‚•πAh the best chips‚•πYes
Stacy's
I ran out of cream
Black coffee it is‚•πoof
imma make hot chocolate
Cy is sending a video‚•πI'm going to write a story‚•πIs that sugar at the bottom?‚•πAnother one‚•πYes‚•πalright
just try too not make it to SA like
Thats a lot of sugar‚•πToo
No
It's like 1.5 cubes‚•πis it?‚•πIts really spread out‚•πIt looks like more‚•πi do like half a spoon
yea‚•πI do 2 tiny spoons‚•πBruh I put ice cream in sometimes and that rocks‚•πBut also this has no cream
Cuz I ran out‚•πyes‚•πRip‚•πu mean milk?‚•πCoffee makers are like printers
Cream‚•πor actual cream‚•πAlso I don't do milk
I do plant based‚•πtsk tsk tsk‚•πHow much do you think that coffee maker cost‚•πcoffee things are like 150$‚•πI do love eating toner‚•πofc
its just the best
which one is ur favorite‚•πIdk‚•πCyan‚•πI actually forgot
But I was looking earlier
They don't charge much for the machines‚•πYes‚•πHave u started cyberpunk‚•πi mean the good ones are like upper 100$‚•πBut since they use proprietary capsules‚•πnope
have u seen the CDPR notice thing‚•πI can't do this whole phone texting thing‚•πYup‚•πI'm leaving the chat and drinking my coffee‚•πthey allowing refunds for console users‚•πDo u have the original Xbox‚•πyea
idrc
seems hit or miss‚•πIf it‚Äôs one x or s it‚Äôs fine if it‚Äôs orig it‚Äôs like 720 p 20 FPS
It‚Äôs not good‚•πif i have ever noticed anything playing on a day one xbox, its that visuals are gonna be bad no matter what
so these kinda bugs are things im used to
RDR2 looked garbage on my xbox and bugged out a ton‚•πNext gen consoles actually look rly good‚•πyea
i wanna get an s
Series S looks good, and is cheaper than the X‚•πWhat made you decide console over pc‚•πive had a console longer
i mean pc may be better‚•πBut you can‚Äôt find any parts lmao‚•πbut i like just sitting at the couch, picking up the controller, turning on surrond sound and playing
yea‚•πTrue‚•πNgl i think the xbox one resolution and stuff is like normal/im used to it
i have a garbage tv regardless‚•πIt‚Äôs playable at the very least‚•π^
oh hell yea‚•πWhich is honestly insane‚•πbesides Jan patch and Feb patch
those should fix everything it seems‚•πPS4 was supposed to give refunds but they aren‚Äôt‚•πthis is
the source code
FOSS‚•πactually?‚•πis
communism‚•πFOSS?‚•πYup they are making people wait until the feb or Jan patch to be allowed to refund them or something‚•πFree Open Source Software‚•π*Cough, never buy digital*‚•π*cough, never preorder*‚•πehh im fine with preordering stuff
i usually get it cheaper
i paid 40$ for cyberpunk‚•πI but dig so i might well just wait‚•πyea its what a 90+ hour game
i mean yea u might as well
if its a game im intrested in ill usually just preorder
oo new GTA dlc came out today‚•πI‚Äôm just about done at 37.5 with a lot of side quests‚•πNice‚•πNot nearly as long as Witcher but still pretty long‚•πHow longs the witcher?‚•πIt took me over 130 hours‚•πDang‚•πHave u read reviews?
Or been on the r/‚•πfor cyberpunk or witcher?
ive seen some‚•πCyberpunk‚•πi dont wanna go there‚•πIt‚Äôs a mess
Day before people were so hyped now they are saying it can‚Äôt be fixed‚•πall the people i usually watch for gameplays and stuff find the game pretty fun‚•πIt‚Äôs pretty good I think but it could never live up to the hype‚•πyea hype got way to big
If it was not hyped so much there would not be this much backlash‚•πThey announced it like 8 years ago but only started working like 3-4 ago prob believed they were working the whole time‚•πyea, but game development is tough i will say that‚•πTrue‚•πyea its also not as big of a company i would say
compared to like sony
or Bungie‚•πThat‚Äôs true‚•πhonestly for what it is its fine
they could never appeal to the market
cause when they delayed it the devs got death threats
so when they released it *slightly* buggy, still people got pissed‚•πOh it‚Äôs rly buggy‚•πhuh it seems really hit or miss‚•πI‚Äôve had many bugs with quests not updating and having to load and reload‚•πsome of the gameplay/reviews people have had no bugs at all‚•πThen randomly getting 3 FPS‚•πoh yeah thats a huge problen‚•πIf they were doing mainly early game or just mainline stuff then it‚Äôs fine‚•πhopefully, HOPEFULLY, this gets all fixed and good in the january patch‚•πIt happened mostly in unskippable cutscenes so it took like 30 mins to get through
Much hope‚•πunskippable cutscenes?‚•πuh
apparently using cyberpunk on linux brings out some bugs and gets rid of other windows cyberpunk bugs‚•πlinix‚•πlinix‚•πgets rid of bugs?
thats not to bad actually‚•πbrings out bugs
as well‚•πi mean it would probably make it run better and stuff‚•πintel
why am i responding
that was a Matthew question‚•πcause if its AMD u need some binaries/fun stuff to make it better‚•πhes using intel tho‚•πoh then that wont fix the frame drops
man game design is really tough‚•πlearn three.js

it works
it just like
opens tabs‚•πyeah‚•πat a rapid rate‚•πi made it open edge tabs
so i would see it‚•πedge is good browser‚•πon my taskbar‚•πuse edge‚•πyeah but ppl bully me for it :(‚•πdont let ppl
get in ur way‚•πi tell them to jump off a cliff and then i feel better :)‚•πgood boy
yknow what i should do
my hw
bye‚•πBing yuck‚•πbing yuck
edge good‚•πliterally switch it to google‚•π^‚•πThen why use edge‚•πbc its better‚•πcause its chrome‚•πthe scrolling is nicer‚•πbut not google‚•πand it works better on windows
and like
its actively getting new features
and it can read social sciences papers aloud to you‚•πreally?‚•πyes
it reads everything aloud
pdfs
websites‚•πoo that nice‚•πit is‚•πu know why u use edge‚•πand the voice isn't half bad‚•πedge://surf
thats it‚•πyes
the only reason
also
even Ramesh uses edge
over chrome‚•πbut not over firefox‚•πits like
why do ppl use pop os over stock ubuntu
they are the same thing
but one is better‚•πidk, i really like ubuntu server‚•πno like for a desktop env‚•πoh yea
pop‚•πeven tho its literally ubuntu
and u can do like apt install pop-skin
on ubuntu‚•πJust use arch‚•πpop is still better
i would use arch
if i had a reason to‚•πi should set up an arch vm‚•πi use windows
windows‚•πill do it over winter break, cause i wanna rice it‚•πis good
i like‚•πit good‚•πregularly use windows features‚•πcontroversial topic
mac os is also not bad‚•πthat are windows exclusive
like
OneNote with a pen
autohotkey
Wireless Display mode‚•πyea those r nice
but i dont use them
or have any need of them‚•πi use OneNote exclusively for notes
i do not use a notebook‚•πi just use .md‚•πi use auto hotkey for lights
and for …ô
and wireless display
just like
always comes in handy
it was truly something at drama club
to be able to cast from the light control pc
to my laptop
and then
just

they always are‚•πbeing in the pit must be cool‚•πthis time maybe i can get mr Harvey to use WS2812s‚•πbut hella hard‚•πsee
our standards are not high
one of
our
lighted signs
last year
started burning
after mr Harvey touched it
and not me‚•πwas it the one u made‚•πno‚•πawww‚•πit was the one Harvey wired
mine were all perfect
*cough‚•πHmmm‚•πinstead
i caused
an explosion
in the booth
after opening house doors‚•πuh wut‚•πon the Saturday night show
with the most ppl
due to
a
um
miscalculation
with regards to
the
um
dial‚•πmiscalculation?‚•πon the multimeter
it was set to
um
current
and not
um
voltage
so‚•πoh no‚•πwhen i shoved it in a plug
it went big kaboom‚•πoh no no jno no non o no no no no non no no no no no no non no‚•πand smoke arose‚•πdont be stupid kids‚•πmr Harvey asked me what i learned
i told him
"always check to make sure ur multimeter is not on current"
he told me
"dont shove random crap in plugs"
"after house doors have opened
"on the Saturday night show"‚•πoh wait‚•πthats like
when they open the doors
to let the audience in‚•πyea ik that
im not completely stupid‚•πdont worry akhil
i will not take his advice
i will continue‚•πok good‚•πto shove random crap in plugs‚•πi thought u were gonna take the advice for a moment‚•πimagine
yknow what was also fun
with that show
2 days before the show‚•πlights?‚•πmr Harvey updated the firmware
on the sound board‚•πthat never goes well‚•πand
it
erased
everything
all the cues
his comment was
"Cy, take a lap or two..."
aka
"I might have a mental breakdown and im not interested in sharing it with you"‚•πhaha‚•πand then Charles
had to come over
and spend like
6 hours
redoing everything
u should join tech
especially since ur not in all honors
so u have some time‚•πim in AP's‚•πk but like‚•πbut yea i might‚•πso am i
and matt‚•πU ded should
Def‚•πdead‚•πI‚Äôm def‚•πare you on desktop
if you are‚•πNo‚•πup arrow is edit last message‚•πAh‚•πhow does one print their own pcb‚•πnow im on desktop so much easier‚•πthe sponsor of this video
i have watched enough GreatScott to know‚•πthey cost like 20$ for shipping alone‚•πmore like $6
they are not too terrible‚•πthe boards are like 5$‚•πbut its not like having a mill in ur house
$2‚•πfor a four layer board
what a deal‚•πyeah what do you want
like
a 10 layer board?‚•π30
no
15‚•πyou only need like
2 layers‚•πOne for every site you have‚•πyes
with pcbs
because‚•πyes ik‚•πyknow what i need‚•πi am looking it up on google‚•πand its just like‚•πmake it say yes‚•πa static site
not a dynamic one
a static one
I will NOT
i repeat NOT
make that right now‚•πmake it dynamic‚•πno
why‚•πtmrw‚•πno
because
it would never need to change‚•πI love these stickers‚•πit would just be like
yes
all the time‚•πbut what about summer‚•πno i would change it then
but thats not worth making a dynamic site
and guess what
summer assignments are a thing
and guess when i finish them
midnight on the last day‚•πi shit you‚•πits tetris
on one of those displays
an ssd1306 display‚•πyes
or this
e ink display‚•πyes
that too
but
that is not as fun
as a simple OLED display‚•πyes‚•πalthough maybe it is
idk
yknow what i must do‚•πidk imma make one of them, or both
HW
do it‚•πstop talking to me
go offline
make me see
that you are not there
to listen‚•πMe when taco bell‚•πwas space just FOMO?
between the Russians and the americans?‚•πYup‚•πI can make u one
I'm getting mill
I can also design it for you based on what its purpose is
But I can only mill a 1 side pcb
I think u can do a 2 on a mill
But idk how‚•πill prob get jlcpcb just to do it
cause they can also do the fancy soldering‚•πjlc has kwality
i have used them‚•πi hate that u cant do the fancy soldering with any other mask
it has to be green mask‚•πwe discuss l8r
i have comments
to make‚•πI will probably submit this
oops I have an extra word‚•πum
i mean
sure
if
like
even zoom thinks i should delete stuff‚•πrip‚•πi will not delete
i will ask for ram
and ssd
for Christmas
what if i used 3 channel memory
does that like
is that bad
or is it good
cuz i dont wanna get 2 new sticks
i also dont wanna replace my current 2‚•π3 channel isnt great‚•πno‚•πi wanna just like‚•πit's like
just
bad‚•πbuy
8gb
stick‚•πcomputer might not even boot
with 3‚•πand insert‚•πi don't think that's a thing you can do
I tried it once
I got some free ram from some random dude in a garage sale
and the ram worked
but I tried putting 3 gb of ram
in my computer
3 sticks
and it no work
1 work
2 work
3 no works
4 works
I think‚•πJust go for another pair‚•π^‚•πbut thats Xpensive‚•πit's like
not‚•πlike 70‚•π50 dollars
no not 70‚•πi dont need 32gb‚•πit's gotten cheaper‚•πfor 16‚•πi bought 32 gigs
for 105‚•πhere
how about this
ill buy one stick
and see if it works‚•πyou should‚•πif it doesnt‚•πbuy in pairs‚•πill buy
another one‚•πit's just like better that way‚•πmuch cheaper to buy in pairs‚•πasdn;flkajsd;flkasdjf‚•π+1‚•πand in higher quanties‚•πI have 32 gigs rn
ill probably update to 64 later‚•πi mean
if i can convince my parents to pay for it
then im good on the 2 sticks
its just that like
i dont like losing money
on unneccesary things‚•πread it cy‚•πalso what storage r u gonna get‚•πi have a 1tb nvme ssd‚•πidk some cheap thing
like‚•πpcie 3‚•πcheap nvme‚•πand a 6tb hdd
and a 1tb hdd‚•πidk or maybe a sabrent‚•πI have a sabrent‚•πi could get a samsung‚•πoverpriced‚•πbut i dont need that kwality‚•πnot necessary‚•πred is blue more like I fucking cried‚•πyou didn't‚•πi did‚•πhe did‚•πwhat is this‚•πi hum to skepticism that you cried
but if you did that was the goal‚•πme‚•πbruh
troll‚•πi should read Ramesh's story‚•πyes do‚•πyou shouldnt unless u ready to cry‚•πcy
this is
500 words‚•πfine ill read it now
and then the great gatsby‚•πI shed 500 tears‚•πmatt
whaddidya think of mine‚•πYes‚•πdude, u can even just look up summaries and stuff‚•πof what‚•πmy story‚•πrepost it
I love seeing cream in the shower‚•πlol
i wonder what cy will think of my story‚•πidk i read it
and
im a little lost
about this glass cage
its probably a me thing‚•πgood‚•πim generally lost
idk who the narrator is‚•πthat was what I expected‚•πis this a person
a child‚•πyes
it like
says
that‚•πwhat happens tho
like
IPE‚•πhe sings a song‚•πjust to see if it makes sense‚•πwhat is ipe‚•πin plain english‚•πHe literally sings a song
and cries about it after‚•πabout what tho
like
pretend i didn't read this‚•πthe song is a bit tricky‚•πwhat does it mean‚•πoh he sings a song about his life
I don't know
myself‚•πhmm‚•πthat's up to your interpretation
you have to see how it fits into your life I guess‚•πsee cuz what im trying to understand
see
i saw this child
right
in a glass cage
being carried away‚•πyes‚•πfrom his family and friends‚•πyes‚•πbut
where
is
like‚•πwho cares
oh‚•πthe meaning and the symbolism
what is the theme
the message‚•πthe message is literally
one of the sentences
at the end
"And I‚Äôd tell everyone to make the front pane can see the back, but I can‚Äôt"‚•πi do not understand
that sentence‚•πdo you
not read the first four paragraphs‚•πeveryone to make the front pane
is a noun‚•πyou can see what the front pane symbolizes
in the first two
the back pane symbolizes in the second two‚•πim getting lost
about the first two
the second two
the people
who are to make the front pane‚•πyou are asking the wrong questions‚•πi am lost, ramesh
as to what it means‚•πhmm
i wonder what akhil will say
also I think I made a mistake‚•πit has lost me with beautiful tone‚•πI am going to splice a line
wdym‚•πit is beautiful writing
that has lost me
in a corn maze
with no end‚•π"He feeds her with pride
His friends ridicule his life
His deeds are alive
Burning with the last light of night"
but then‚•πok but like ik hes being taken away‚•πi go over the stupid word limit
ok‚•πbut‚•πit can be
reasonably inferred
he is being taken away
because
he tried to commit suicide
because he's depressed‚•πthe baby?‚•πthe child comes from the baby‚•πwhat‚•πthis is puberty
he wonders where he came from
and the implications of this‚•πthe child
cannot
what
is
the child has a baby
i do not get it‚•πno
the child was once a baby right‚•πyes‚•πso now he wonders
"the baby is alive"
"the child wonders why"
so why was the baby alive
why was he given life‚•πso
hes thinking back‚•πthe child wonders
how to make babies‚•πbut
who tries to commit suicide
and how old is the child‚•πthe child‚•πand what is happening to them‚•πtries committing suicide
and the child is probably an adolescent
since adolescents undergo puberty‚•π2 things‚•πthe child‚•π1. does this involve worldbuilding - like i have to understand this glass container‚•πtries to commit suicide
no‚•πand 2.
at first‚•πtechnically the glass container is metaphorical
but it comes from a movie scene‚•πi didn't even know whether this narrator is person or fish‚•πat the end of some mission impossible movie
it is a person
he has a family
and friends
you are thinking about it too much‚•πi will read it again‚•πcy
i do not make my narrators
pieces of soap‚•πmy narrator was not a piece of soap
also i read it again
i kinda catch where this is coming from
i see the glass cage as this separator between the adolescent and the real world
and he looks down on the real world
reminiscing about his life
prior to entering it
but
the "zoo"
loses me
and some of the poem
and you have some grammatical issues
I look behind me again, and rem
i look behind myself again‚•πthe zoo‚•πis what‚•πuh
like a caged animal‚•πbut‚•πlike they observe it with interesting and disinterest‚•πthe caged animals
are not commiting suicide‚•πhe already‚•πand they did not decide
to be caged‚•πtried committing suicide‚•πdid he succeed?‚•πthe end result is he is being wheeled to an insane asylum‚•πah‚•πno otherwise he wouldn't be in the cage‚•πwell idk
like i said
i thought he was a fish‚•πgrammar
you think in weird ways
literally how
does a fish have school‚•πyes
as a matter of fact‚•πasl;dfsal;f
pun
i hate this‚•πsee
its just
too hard
to infer‚•πoccam's razor‚•πthat he is going to an insane asylum‚•πsee that's my intention
but idrc where you think he's going
that's like just not the point‚•πi think hes dead
or not present
in the real world‚•πuh
the last line shows he's dying
so he's still alive
wait
i see
why
this could make not sense‚•πidk i think theres too much going on‚•πlook i had to get it in 500 words‚•πyou must write a story
with an intention
of being concise
excluding
anything
unneccesary
like the zoo‚•πshrug‚•πidk‚•πit's description‚•πhow many ppl have read this‚•πwell I doubt anyone is going to read this other than you
no one‚•πhave someone else read it‚•πi have
no friends‚•πsee if they are also just as lost
were you lost‚•πyes‚•πwhen you read mine‚•πslightly confused
but not lost‚•πi see‚•πbut like
if you keep reading mine
and try to understand it
it makes sense‚•πlook
i can derive meaning from things
but
you need
to guide me‚•πlike
i just like‚•πyour story‚•πthe fish thing‚•πmust not‚•πdoesn't make sense‚•πsimply
present itself
it must
guide
my derivations
of meaning
and generalization
so essentially
be more specific‚•πI agree‚•πbut i mean idk if ur not going to send ur story to anyone else‚•πthen I go over the word limit‚•πur not gonna get good feedback‚•πi do
they dont read‚•πget rid of unneccesary‚•πthem
there is plenty necessary‚•πyou can cut things out
you can be more concise
how many times have you rewritten this story‚•πthe poem is hard
to be concise on
i think i can do some things though‚•πramesh
the word limit
should not be an issue
for short stories‚•πi write
long stories‚•πyou should be easily below the word limit
well then write a short one‚•πmy
short stories
are two pages‚•πdid you read "The Landlady" by roald dahl‚•πand like 1000 words
no‚•πits not particularly short
its like 3 pages
but its like mine
it never mentions death once
but it is a story of killing
murder‚•πYes
This is a good story‚•πit is right?‚•πIts one of my favorites
Yup its all implied
Which makes it super good
YES
The best quote‚•πyes indeed‚•πArsenic is wonderful‚•πArsenic?‚•πthe poison‚•πi think it was
cyanide‚•πthe smell is of Arsenic
oh wait yea cyanide
same thing‚•πcyanide was the bitter almonds‚•πits a poison‚•πyes‚•πnew leather was dead flesh‚•πthat sounds right
hmm
cadaverine‚•πwait
actually idk‚•πit sounds right
regardless‚•πanyway‚•πits a good story‚•πit is a good story
akhil
what did you think of my story‚•πhello\‚•πdid you understand it‚•πsend‚•πdid akhil read mine‚•πfor the third time‚•πboth of u pin ur stuff‚•πhere it is‚•πhmm
its better than what it was before‚•πit is no different
than what it was before‚•πu added more details i feel
like blue dove bar‚•πi changed nothing
this is the original version‚•πhuh then yea its fine
its pretty good
there should still be more impact‚•πyes ik‚•πalso
do fish sing‚•πit needs some work
but like‚•πdo fish
sing‚•πlook‚•πliterally like
why‚•πyou are weird
so idk
what
u might do‚•πlike
do fish
sing‚•πalso it might be some other animal
that sings‚•πsigh‚•πpersonification is a thing‚•πim not gonna understand you
no
dont
im editing it‚•πand tell me if u understand it‚•πto make it a little clearer
please dont wait
no
here‚•πits not bad
its intresting
ok correct me if i am wrong
but the MC is a patient?‚•πbasically yeah‚•πah makes sense‚•πdo you understand the title?‚•πcause u mention purple, red and blue make purple‚•πuh that actually works
but that wasn't what I intended
but that's actually a great interpretation
can i give you some hints‚•πor is it something having to due with the line red was the sky or something
uh sure‚•πthere was another line
not red is the sky‚•πah
Let him see the red
and turn it to blue?‚•πyes
and what is red
's‚•πFire‚•πsymbolism
what else‚•πuh blood
oh is it a play on the idea
that blood is red and blue?‚•πno not blood
there is another one‚•πhmm‚•πsigh
look at the context akhil
"beauty lies"‚•πlove?‚•πyes
what does blue symbolize‚•πUh like stability
trust
the Sky‚•πsadness‚•πlove is sadness?‚•πyes
that is the title of the story‚•πhmm it makes sense‚•πdoes this entire story now
make sense to you
if I changed my title to be less puzzling‚•πno keep it‚•πlike get it he chases her lies
and then gets sad‚•πyea‚•πbut hes too weak
to sever his relationship
built on lies
so he tries to kill himself
and all his friends abandon him as a result‚•πyea
man why yall make such sad stories‚•πwhat could I do
to make it like
less confusing‚•πits not confusing per se imo
its u just gotta think‚•πcy doesn't like that
i feel like i could like make this
help
since it's not useful
this was part of another idea that I had for this story
but I can't include that‚•πhmmm u can remove it‚•πI would add something else instead‚•πbut here is my question‚•πyeah‚•πu rhymed the poem right‚•πyes
it's a song
poem‚•πwhats the pattern‚•πrandom
i didn't really think about it
i just wanted it to rhyme to have a rhythm‚•πok i would say try to have a pattern‚•πhmm okay
I think there is a pattern at the beginning‚•πlike abab or abba baab‚•πbut it like goes away‚•πyea‚•πi think this does rhyme tho
abbc‚•πyea but try to stick into a pattern‚•πok i have to pretend for gym‚•πgl‚•πwe're not doing exercise
but still
ok nvm it's bad‚•πwhat are you doing thats so bad?‚•πanything
in gym
is bad‚•πE‚•π10‚•π9‚•π8‚•π7‚•π6.5
6‚•π5.5
5‚•πgym is stupid
4.5
4‚•πgym is very stupid‚•π3.5‚•π3.5‚•π3‚•π3
2.5‚•π2.5‚•π2‚•π2
1.5‚•π1.5‚•π1‚•π1‚•πgym
is over
i think‚•πNice
i was let out like 5 minutes ago‚•πscrew gym
there's also this other part of the story
like
"maybe I could have saved my life if I had told my parents or reached out to someone"
so that's what this has to accomplish‚•πi showed my English teacher my story
and she told me
about mine
exactly
what i told u
about yours
its beautiful
and the style is great‚•πthat u should be more concise?‚•πbut its too ambiguous‚•πI feel thats the point isnt it‚•πyou need to guide the reader more
it is
and she knew this
shes like
yes
its supposed to be ambiguous
i like that
but‚•πthats the charm‚•πits a little too ambiguous
its like making a game
a puzzle game
no its not supposed to be straightforward
but it also cannot be prohibitively difficult
so the challenge‚•πmine is the same
wait‚•πis finding how you can make it as ambiguous‚•πi was quite literally‚•πas possible‚•πtelling akhil the exact same thing‚•πwhile ppl can still understand
and this measure
is almost always misrepresented
by the writer's interpretation
its like hatchbox
and so is mine
they are just
too hard‚•πactually cy
i changed mine‚•πim just saying what my English teacher said‚•πik
just like
read‚•πyou should show your story
to your‚•πthis one‚•πenglish teacher‚•πill show mine
to my
10th grade english teacher‚•πwho‚•πDr. Kuscenko
Good teacher‚•πi have Harding
shes also good‚•πnah
dr. k is the best english teacher‚•πmeh‚•πread my revised one
and see if it makes more sense‚•πk its a bit clearer
but
there are some issues‚•πwhat is red
what is blue‚•πidk that‚•πlet me try something
red = love
blue = sadness
now substitute
and see if you get the entire thing‚•πI mean I kinda get it
the problem is‚•πwhat‚•π1. I have already read it
and you have explained it to me already‚•πno
i changed
like you have to undersatnd‚•πik but I already understand the story‚•πthe overarching idea‚•πnow‚•πwhat happens
what happens‚•πyou told me‚•πexplain it to me‚•πhe looks back at his life‚•πno
tell me what you understand‚•πsings a song‚•πyes no like
the song is his life
so what is the song about
since the song is like the story‚•πi dont get the song
very much‚•πhmm
this is kinda like setup‚•πthis is like‚•πi already explained this‚•πsaving the baby‚•πhe sees sexual attraction
tires to pursue it
"she won't let him catch her light"
doesn't come to fruition
so his pursuit fails
it makes him hurt
it makes him lose hope in life
and his family can't see his suffering‚•πk so
hold on‚•πhe's afraid of burning his friendship with her
he should really take the love and turn it into sadness‚•πso
hold on
And I‚Äôd tell everyone to make the front pane can see the back, but I can‚Äôt.‚•πbut he can't
because they were friends once it means something
the friendship that is going to end shouldn't‚•πthis
means
and id tell everyone to make my family see what really happened, but i cant
cuz the front pane
is the family
and the back pane‚•πi would have
like when i was suffering‚•πis what happened‚•πyeah
and his friends who knew about it‚•πk so that was not clear
like
at all
make that clearer‚•πactually yes
i agree
okay
i will do that
i was really confused what i wanted to write when I wrote this first‚•πAnd I see both sides, but neither side can see the other; to them, the other side is obsidian
this
is also bad
for 2 reasons‚•πso he tries to kill himself
without letting go of his love (since he can't)
it failed
obsidian is black
obscured‚•πthe reason it is bad
is that
1. it explains something to the reader - nothing should be explained that should be inherent - such as glass‚•πok actually this is confusing‚•π2. It does not make sense unless you know that thing about the panes‚•πyou know like those windows‚•πlike‚•πwhere you can see outside
but they can't see inside‚•πvariable referenced before assignment
k but then clarify that
say that these are one way windows‚•πwell they can only
see
the person
inside
not through the back of the pane‚•πidk i think you need to work out
that whole glass thing‚•πi think it makes sense
but‚•πcuz it doesn't exactly make sense
like it makes sense sort of
when you use that line
but that line
is bad
cuz its like‚•πhm
i think‚•πsaying‚•πHuh wut?‚•πthat the glass‚•πdo you understand‚•πis one way‚•πlike‚•πwithout actually saying that‚•πno it's not‚•πand
like‚•πit's not‚•πudnerstand what‚•πexplaining
like
it
just
doesnt‚•πstop texting cy‚•πlemme see if i can get it‚•πits bad‚•πlet me
tell you what im asking
it's
do you get
that
the family can see the child in the glass
but they cannot see through the back of the glass‚•πyes they look with disgust right‚•πand the school scene (if anyone were there)
can
see the child
but they can't see
the family
on the other side‚•πi thought
it was that‚•πno‚•πthats a given right‚•πit's not‚•πthe child could see them‚•πthis wasn't developed though‚•πbut not the other way‚•πno‚•πthe glass does not symbolize this properly.‚•πI think‚•πchange the glass.‚•πthey could see the child‚•πit's implied
the
family can see the child
and the child can see the family‚•πbut not the other parties right‚•πthe family cannot see the school
the school can see the child‚•πyea‚•πthe child can see the school
the school cannot see the family‚•πits symbolsim right‚•πyeah something like that‚•πthe problem is like‚•πhow we seperate our school lives from home‚•πyou are making
digital logic‚•πEXACTLY
100%‚•πout of like
glass
which
doesn't compute‚•πhuh?‚•πfantasy‚•πglass is transparent both ways‚•πfantasy‚•πno there is one way glass‚•πbut the rest of your story
is not fantastical
its
rather‚•πliterally like who cares
it's technology‚•πnot fantastical‚•πthat's not the focus of the story‚•πbut the reader will not understand‚•πyou could probably make something like this‚•πi mean i did‚•πyeah
the idea
is the symbolism‚•πi reccomend you try and make a puzzle game‚•πof family-school separation‚•πand then
find out
how many hints you have to give ppl
before they can win
this is the same thing‚•πi think it's kinda obvious‚•πyou think
it is
but
its not‚•πbut then why did akhil get it‚•πafter like
explanation
and after that line‚•π?‚•πthe line‚•πi can see
my family‚•πabout the glass
is bad‚•πmy family‚•πthe glass is not glass‚•πcan see me‚•πit doesn't compute
it does not flow‚•πmy family
doesn't
see the friends‚•πdo you understand what i am saying
that line
the last one you sent‚•πyes i get it‚•πis bad‚•πthen maybe it's not glass‚•πCy is saying that that type of glass is impossible‚•πthen‚•πbut it has the texture and feeling‚•πdont call it glass‚•πis glass
i bet something like this exists‚•πyou need to choose something
for which‚•πdoes he though?‚•πthat explanation is not required
yes‚•πhe doesnt have to say‚•πhe does‚•πA one way plastic‚•πno‚•πi feel glass works fine‚•πthink harder
what
is something‚•πi think the glass works fine‚•πthat meets
your needs‚•πyou can think about how it's possible later
you could use like
two one-way glasses stuck to each other‚•πit breaks the flow‚•πthat wont work‚•πsee
then
the reader starts thinking‚•πnot this‚•πabout how
that is possible
and they get conflicting data‚•πthen i encourage them to‚•πcuz on one hand‚•πthere's probably a way to do it‚•πur telling them
that its glass‚•πthat's like‚•πwhich is transparent‚•πnot the point of the story‚•πthat is what glass is
but then
on another hand
u are telling them‚•πoh so you think that it would confuse them?‚•πthat the glass has some magic properties
that prevent certain ppl from seeing certain things
but then like‚•πand they would read too much
into the glass‚•πits not glass
no
they just
wouldnt get it
without that line
and that line‚•πor u could just say that both parties neglected to see each other‚•πis bad
and must go‚•πlike
then i can't explain the symbolism‚•πyou
should not‚•πi dont think anyone is reading to heavy into the glass‚•πof the family-social separation‚•πexplain
symbolism‚•πI agree
some people
like‚•πsymbols‚•πdon't tell their families about what they do with their friends‚•πfundamentally
do not need to be explained‚•πand don't tell their friends what they do with their family‚•πunless you are doing worldbuilding‚•πyeah that's the glass‚•πand even then
you explain the object
then use it as a symbol
not all at once
idk all im saying is that
this line
in your story
was painful
to read‚•πdoes it continue to make sense
without the line‚•πno
it does not‚•πexactly‚•πthat is why
you must
not choose glass‚•πi think the glass has a charm to it‚•πif you want this‚•πyeah‚•πfrom the readers
yes‚•πi support the glass‚•πit does‚•πcan we get additional data points‚•πbut this sketch is not solving
you are overconstraining
essentially
IPE
you are using a symbol
that requires explanation
but explanation is not allowed
so either remove the explanation and change the symbol‚•πthe entire story cy
is hinged‚•πor remove the explanation and change the proposed meaning‚•πon the symbol‚•πhonestly it could be glass with a privacy filter on it‚•πthen
it matters‚•πi am pretty sure theres a way‚•πyes, but no
that is ugly sounding
for example
lemme give an example
shsushushushsh
imagine
you wanted a box
that you could only see out of, not into.
then
you could use a box with small holes
that the character could look through
you do not need one way glass
you simply need
something entirely different
you are dealing with a conflict
and one side must change
either the symbol
or what you want it to mean
please
whatever you do
do not
explain
symbols.‚•πim not
im
telling you what the symbol is‚•πyes
you are telling me what it is
do not
do that‚•πa lot of stories do this‚•πlook‚•πthey bring attention to it‚•πif you want magic glass
you can first describe the glass
then
in a separate statement
say that the box is made from it
you cannot
say
that the box is made from glass
and then explain
that the glass is not actually see through
that distracts
and hurts
your flow
its one thing to describe a symbol
and another to explain or "tell" it
you can even remind ppl of what the symbol represents
like i do
just
cannot
define a magical object
like you did there
but alas
you do as you see fit
k im done
u can speak
at some point‚•πwhen‚•πidk whenever you want
maybe tmrw
cuz maybe there will be a snow day
but u didn't respond
they know best
and they are available resource for you‚•πhi‚•πyou should listen to them‚•πi dont know my english teacher‚•πi know all my teachers‚•πask ur last year one‚•πi might‚•πif we dont have a snow day tmrw imma ask Mr Y about surveying
like
if u wanted projects
cuz i think its a good idea‚•πyea
i might, might just piggy back off of ur idea and make a xcode app based on ur web thingy
but prob not‚•π?
what web thingy
i have 15‚•πany of them‚•πyknow whats bad‚•πwhy?‚•πidk
"We are working on the issue, and service will be resumed momentarily"
-Cy‚•πah okay‚•πyknow what i should do‚•πdid u figure out how to get email server up?‚•πi should make readybeluga and hatchbox systemctl services
it half works‚•πCy and Matt if u want me just private dm me‚•πthis‚•πIt‚Äôs hard to find the @
They always get buried‚•πuse my cycloudd link
ha
ha
*scream
*anger
*sad
i erased
everything
similarly to how i erased hatchbox yesterday
cy is getting mad
things
are not
being done as per protocol
things are breaking
looks
has
an animation
ugly
cy just
came
to understand
the meaning
of life
the reason nginx kept crashing
was because of his involvement
in the .bashrc file
whatg ;alskdfj asdfsdf
now he understands
and now
he feels trust
in his server‚•πred is blue
red is blue and love is sorrow‚•πi have successfully
made
more than half
of my websites
be down
tell me please
how to fix nginx
no dont tell me
lemme hear what nginx has to say about this
tell me what this error means
see whats weird
is if i restart nginx
without doing anything
it unbreaks
and works
but when the pi boots
this happens
nvm the internet is a wonderful place
except that
like
actually
that error
is on an external server
that is always running
*sigh‚•πum what
im watching some movie‚•πramesh
save me‚•πlater‚•πfrom nginx‚•πuse
caddy‚•πno
ramesh
life lesson
when someone asks you to help them with something
dont just tell them to use something else
i have done this to ppl
and they yell at me
and tell me
that if i were applying for a job with them
they would not hire me
that being said
i will examine caddy
cuz it seems interesting
k i solved my problem
by telling nginx
to just
wait
like
take a breath or two
let everyone around you get settled in
then start hammering them with requests
cuz it hammered cycloudd with a request before the pi was even online
this is the command btw
in case you ever need it
put it in your nginx.service file
above the others like it‚•πLets go
No school tmrw
Kinda bad kinda good‚•πhow u know
where it say‚•πSchool called‚•πthe fone?‚•πYea‚•πoh i didn't hear it

theres like
no incentive‚•πmeh
idk what im even submitting to
so like‚•πit's a club
who will like read your story and choose one to publish on their website or something‚•πk
imma make edits
then
do more homework‚•πmhm‚•πm hm‚•πo right my stupid gym assignment is due tomorrow‚•πi wanna add "flickers" by Wrabel to my radio on my site
its a really good song‚•πi was satisfied enough when someone read my story and said it was "intriguing"
since like
that's what I got from yours
go do that then‚•πmy radio is down
and i
am not
putting it up again
right now‚•πd'accord‚•πAnd the next morning ‚Äì it was he, who would not hear me speak, who would not hear my cry, when I did. It was he, who would not hear me tell of my woes; my woes for which there was now no one left there to listen.‚•πwhy did you choose a he
you're not having enough gender diversity in this story‚•πthere are reasons
which
i will not
describe‚•πdid you submit yours‚•πnot yet‚•πis my writing good
like not like
the story
the writing
didlss‚•πyour writing is good
um
i was gonna elaborate
but
i dont pay attention to didls
and stuff like that
i sort of
read with my own rules
but i can say that your writing sounds like that of a professional, like Brandon Sanderson
at a low level‚•πspeaking of brandon sanderson
you should consider
reading chapter 1‚•πno‚•πit's like only 2 pages
not really
but it won't be long‚•πim not reading that book
im reading a different book
if ima read a book‚•πplease read it
it's like worth reading‚•πi do too much else to be able to read books‚•πit's like fun‚•πthat i am not interested in‚•πyou will
slowly
get interested in it
you will see what I mean‚•πalso i dont particularly like his style personally‚•πthat's literally
the first chapter‚•πyes‚•πthat character's way is weird‚•πand also
your story‚•πlike‚•πi can tell
by your writing‚•πthis one is not
the like
the grain house one is
but this one is not so much‚•πima look at lists of good books on the internet‚•πliterally
just read the way of kings‚•πfind ones that sound cool
and are rated well‚•πand then consider it‚•πand are not fantasy‚•πyou are biased against fantasy books
you have to read a good one‚•πi dont like mushrooms.
even if they are the best mushrooms
i dont like mushrooms.‚•πthat's like
i hate brussel sprouts
no matter how they are cooked
i hate brussel sprouts
and then you realize
there is another way to cook them‚•πyou can come to like something
if you need to
but
you can also choose something you find yourself to already like
if the consequences are not present‚•πi hate linux
no matter what kind of linux it is
i hate linux‚•πi dont hate
anything‚•πso i wont try to like linux
i wont
consider
a new linux distro
that seems intriguing
but i have to delve further to see just how polished it
is‚•πlook ramesh
heres the scoop
im sure
with enough time
i could come to like worldbuilding
but you must understand
i have mental issues
i have a disconnect
between the 2 parts of my brain
my ability to read and understand
is directly proportional to interest and excitement
i cannot read 1000 pages
if i am not interested in them‚•πah but you see like‚•πsimilarly
with ppl like you‚•πwhat if‚•πyou can read 1000 pages in 3 days‚•πyou become interested in the 1000 pages‚•πif you are interested‚•πit took me
a month
to read the first book‚•πwhat if i dont though‚•πthen dont‚•πand i dont understand‚•πbut 1 chapter
isn't a good indication of that
1 chapter
that's not even related to the main plot of the story‚•πi do not understand why we are arguing about personal preferences
books are like music
and movies
and design
they are a form of art
that strikes the mind‚•πim not arguing about personal preference‚•πand
it must‚•πim simply trying to convince you‚•πstrike the mind‚•πto read more of this book‚•πin the right place‚•πchange that to plate, and you get a scene in the book‚•πlook next time i have time‚•πliterally
striking plates to get art‚•πill think about it‚•πis a scene in this book‚•πits just that
if i find myself counting pages‚•πi did too
i was trying to finish it
so i could read the fourth book‚•πthere are books for which i do not find myself counting pages
i find myself enthralled‚•πyou may find yourself enthralled
but even at the end of part 1 you might not come to love it
the reallly good part of the book is towards the end of it
but hopefully it makes you interested enough you want to read to there‚•πim not a fast reader‚•πthat's fine
i took
a month
reading no other books
to finish the way of kings
last year it didnt take me that long‚•πit takes me 3 months
to read 300 pages
in the summer‚•πwell try it
if it fails
at least
you gave the book a chance‚•πi dont have the time budget‚•πalso
if you dont wanna read this
read mistborn
it's shorter‚•πalso‚•πand fantasy‚•πi wanna read‚•πand still good‚•πsomething
you havent read‚•πÏôú‚•π*sigh‚•πha
ok imma like not
i have to sleep soon‚•πi have to do 1 hour of math and 30 minutes of reading
and take a shower
and prepare everything for tmrw
to go to school
and sumbit this story
good night‚•πgood night‚•πzoom just crashed
ahhhh‚•πyay?‚•πno‚•πwait yea its def broken
ive been waiting for host to start meeting for like 7 min now‚•πMichael is in class‚•πramesh is in cy's class‚•πI see him on the screen‚•πI am panicking very hard‚•πwhy

then they can worry bout covid-20‚•πYea but it prob gonna spred
I mean its prob easy to beat that‚•πThats why they gotta make travel restrictions
just stop traveliing to and from the UK for a couple months‚•πCuz we hav existing reacherch‚•πyea‚•πSo we only hav to change a few sequences
Yea but like essential travel like drs and packages and whatever‚•πMight be a bit more than just a few

Those images r buggy sometimes‚•πyea thats a safari mobile only issue
i have no fkin clue why
its like
no sense‚•πNo it happens sometimes with edge as well‚•πit has never happened to me
on edge
but
it happens on my moms iphone‚•πIll scroll and all the images will disappear and stuff‚•πyeah
ik
cuz
it annoys me
why
why is this‚•πIdk‚•πits like
probably something to do with the fixed backgrounds
here hold on
imma remove the fixed backgrounds
and then u try again
try again
skreen rekord‚•πIts a bit better
But wtf is taking the website to ‚Äúload‚Äù so long‚•πi think its the audio
which is down rn
hey the images arent broken anymore
in that video
so i think
safari users
will get
another compatibility message
and will have their fixed backgrounds disabled
essentially there will be one compatibility message
"plz use edge or chrome bc ima not devote my life to browser compatibility"
"thx"
oh btw
ive spent like 15 hours with alankar

and leave it at that‚•πalso i think its a bug but
if ur gonna install using the repo thing
u gotta install everything again‚•πcongrats, i literally put this in the slides presentation‚•πso if u try to install tetris, it will uninstall everything else so u gotta select khicas, gb em, red and tetris, and the other nes em
themes r jsons so u can change them as well‚•πuh
how do I control it‚•πRed?
Uh i think
Power is select‚•πhow do I make it like

I couldnt download one without a virus‚•πyeah i dont want to hurt my head playing gb games‚•πIts not the worst

zelda and what‚•πi have zelda and super mario‚•πOkay I'm using Chrome and installing tetris
and that's it‚•πnice‚•πsince that's all I'll ever play if I have to play with it
and Khi‚•πtrue‚•πduh‚•πi might get snake on it
or donkey kong
or 007‚•πi wish
it supported snes
the zelda game for that one is good‚•πi mean yea
but i dont think it can run it any good at that point‚•πthe gb version kept tearing‚•πalso toolbox is save
i mean mine does as well
but its not as bad‚•πyeah nes emu is good
also

covid-20
is bad‚•πi want opinions‚•πbad‚•πwhat is bad
about it
also it has been updated a little since 15:28 today
there were issues with fonts and icons‚•πWait thats kinda cool‚•πwhat
my website
or eve devices‚•πthis‚•πah yes
it is‚•πits like a better surface‚•πyes
that is their selling point
also
i need feedback‚•πits okay
i personally dont like the design‚•πwhy not‚•πidk
it seems off to me'‚•πwhat specifically
the font
the cover page
the colors
the blur
?‚•πig its the harsh contrast from the picture and the neon green‚•πok so about the neon green
i need a better monitor
cuz mine does not render colors
correctly‚•π^ get this‚•πits $1400 and not coming out until god knows when
but that being said
i would
if i could
i wanted an original V
when the original V came out
but i didnt wanna wait 3 months for it
i needed a new laptop for robotics
and i needed it soon
so i got the Yoga‚•πlooks cool and all
but hella expensive‚•πi mean its not bad for the price
i just like‚•πand u can add skins‚•πwant my website to be good
is there anything other‚•πits not bad‚•πthat you have to say‚•πuh u know that menubar
at the top‚•πyes‚•πi would shift it to the right‚•πso right align it‚•πand have the logo on the left
yea‚•πi would do that
i was considering it
but i decided against it
because
then the logo would appear twice
and‚•πmakes sense cause big logo‚•πthe logo does not look good small
its actually a t-shirt design‚•πhave the logo appear when you scroll past the huge cover thing
also does the cover fill ur screen?‚•πno
its supposed to only fill 80%
notice their covers
only take 80%‚•πyea they r pretty similar
hmm i think thats everything else then
just the bright neon green
and right align‚•πidk about the right align
but i will take your opinion
and ask everyone else
theirs
and see
also
on my website
what do you think
of the angled menu items‚•πi like it‚•πi see
k thx‚•π..........‚•πits like

Until I work out https‚•π:(‚•πHttps being my dilemma‚•πnon‚•πI need to have a reverse proxy
That doesn't touch ssl‚•πthen don't
use https
in nginx‚•πI need to have a stable reverse proxy on my nextcloud server‚•πuse nginx‚•πAnd it cannot mess with https‚•πif you
configure nginx right
it won't‚•πTo localhost 444‚•π,m.wait
my keyboard
im pressing random buttons on it
yes
you can do it with nginx i think‚•πThis tutorial said to use HAproxy‚•πhow do I CHANGE THE LIGHTING MODE ON MY KEYBOARD
nah just use nginx
i gotta read something for english‚•πThey said it's a lot harder
Cuz u have to use streams
I don't think imma go to tec
I have things to do‚•πDid u hear that piracy of movies and music could now get up to 10 years in prison and a felony‚•πNo‚•πoh no‚•πYeah it got snuck into the covid relief bill‚•πWtf
Covid relief bill
DMCA‚•πYeah‚•π><
My nextcloud is going down
While I deal with this reverse proxy stuff
I hate typing on phones
Maybe I need a bigger phone‚•πCy r u doing tech club‚•πI have things to do‚•πIn anyone in here in ap comp sci‚•πyes
why
only kinda *
cough‚•πhow do you do the final coding bat
it makes no sense‚•πwhat does it look like
send me a picture
i can probably tell you‚•πI dont get the order it returns for expected number 2‚•πlink me to the codingbat‚•πyou should
loop through with i+=2
right
yeah
it's not even numbers
it's even indices‚•πim so dumb
ok‚•πnp‚•πyeah
indicies
akhil and ramesh are online‚•πok‚•πramesh suggests‚•πWe did it‚•πfor my https problem‚•πi made an omega theme‚•πcool
to use nginx‚•πhmm
i mean u should always use nginx‚•πmy main issue is this
firstly nginx requires setting up a stream
to do this
which may be unfun
and 2
be it HAproxy or Nginx it needs to have if/else logic
else go there‚•πwhy?‚•πcuz this is an upstream reverse proxy
it only takes what is for the nextcloud
and gives all other https traffic
to the pi
it does no ssl
ssl is handled by apache on the nextcloud server
and nginx on the pi‚•πhmm‚•πthis is the issue
i search "how to make nginx/haproxy route all OTHER traffic"
but i get not result‚•πwell hold on‚•πsame way you always do
every connection has a hostname associated with it
has akhil not done reverse proxy before‚•πthen why dont u just filter that request, but have it not reject the request
i havent‚•πi see
well this is just a syntax issue‚•πi have no need for one‚•πi have many need for one‚•πcause i have seperate machines for all my stuff‚•πall running at my house
i already have a reverse proxy
but i wanna notherone
for https
that is stable
and upstream
cuz it has to handle nextcloud
which has to be stable
cuz my family uses it
ramesh knows how to solve this issue
please solve this issue
apparantly the judges like my story
according to ramesh‚•πwhat was that story even for‚•πfun
and Devil's Quill‚•πahh‚•πalso
tell me your opinion of
design wise‚•πMaybe a darker theme‚•πk
anything else‚•πabout section centered or a pic on the left‚•πk‚•πand if a pic a smaller box under the text‚•πk
ok
thx for ur feedback‚•πnp looks good though
different purposes cy2 is just a series of links and 4h is more info driven‚•πi see‚•πwhat do u guys do at 4H‚•πkomputers‚•πis it like comp sci club‚•πyeah kinda

im lost as to myself
are you?‚•πNope
I dont think so‚•πOne of the biggest players in the issue of Gender Stereotypes is Stereotype Threat. Stereotype Threat is the fear of conforming to a stereotype, and, in effect, proving it true. The main effects of stereotype threat are increased stress, and changes in decision making, which can affect the outcomes of tasks that are being done by people experiencing stereotype threat. For example, girls in education, especially in MSE, Math, Science and Engineering, may experience stereotype threat, because stereotypes tend to exclude them from these environments. This consequently results in increased stress, and in turn lower retention of information and lower test scores. Studies found though, that what you told these stereotyped individuals before they took the test had an effect on how much they experienced stereotype threat. So if you told them that girls generally tend to do better on this test, they would perform better. Gender stereotypes and stereotype threat also exist in sales and finance. Studies found that when
except it cannot sound scripted‚•πPause and say um sometimes‚•πso i did a speak-script with highlights‚•πHmm here and there‚•πikr‚•πPretend to lose your thoughts
Its a skill
Called
Deception‚•πno i have that skill
and i also
actually lose my thoughts
the thing is i cannot look at the script
i have to be looking at his eyes
i can glance at the script
i think i got it pretty good
i just practiced
now i need to do the same thing for another section
learn to use OBS
and maybe listen to a little music
cuz why not
before 5PM‚•πPrerecord ur stuff‚•πno‚•πPrerecord a video‚•πthis is live
tmrw
in class‚•πPlay it during zoom
Oof‚•πquestions will be asked
i meet with my group at 5
we finish our TMP
then we rehearse
and ideally we record as well
as a test
im actually not taking down my nextcloud server
not until break
cuz i might need it
between now and then
unless i can get the whole thing up and running tonight
which is unlikely
meh ill just upload my TMP to youtube
that way mr y doesnt get greeted by a nice connection actively refused page
hes a communication guy
he doesnt like it
when ppl activley refuse his requests
to communicate
americans do not listen to Emily Burns
at least on spotify
but then for like all the other ppl i listen to
its like
chicago
and dallas
and chicago
and dallas
i should stop listening to music and do AP seminar

also i figured out obs
you install it
click auto configure
then you click add desktop
then you click record

I haven‚Äôt gotten mine yet
We j got one that would post‚•πoh
from cu cool‚•πCy‚•πyes
what is it
i am in the middle

and the lag‚•πI can try your server‚•πis just too long‚•πHow‚•πCy‚•πyes‚•πYour'e not cy‚•πyour e not cy‚•πI just finished this
it took me like 11 hrs‚•πCool‚•πIma do some web development tommrow‚•πIma do some hardware tomorrow‚•πWut u doin‚•πima make my ili9341 display work
with my pi
or maybe do some iot stuff

windoze bad‚•πwindows on raspberry pi
is good
its fast
and its better than linix for a desktop environment
that is
once they fix sound‚•πnot true‚•πand wifi
it is true
on Raspbian
the fonts
are bad
in krome
and there is no edge
and half the programs u wanna run just dont
cuz arm
on windows
these are not issues‚•πAHHHH‚•πHow did you even do that Sam‚•πIDEKKKK
This is the buos^
How the frick do u change xmp profiles‚•πlinus tek tips‚•πThis profile is 3600‚•πwhat is the speed of ur ram‚•πBut it won‚Äôt work
3200
I believe‚•πI see
um‚•πLemme check‚•πsam
enable
xmp‚•πNo it‚Äôs 3600‚•πidk how to do ram tuning
i like
didn't
do that on my pc
you should ask ramesh‚•πum
idk
i just set mine to 3200
like
i enabled xmp and then set the multiplier
then it works
the end
uwu‚•πIssue solved
We looked in task manager‚•πyes uwu
UWU‚•πAnd we we‚Äôre good üòé‚•πso am i
soon
soon‚•πShould I get some led stripes?‚•πstrips yes‚•πThis is all the lighting I have‚•πoof that's bad
which kraken tho‚•πX63‚•πsame as mine
yees get some
my mobo has some lighting too but not much‚•πBruh it‚Äôs been a constant 45 even while plying cpu intensive games ü•∫‚•πreally
that is nice
linux can't track zen3 temps atm‚•πOh rly?‚•πyeah
but in a few days
it will get updated
and i can
im getting a new mobo soon uwu
what is this garbage‚•πcy has an issue
see
in his house
the router is in the basement
but
there is an access point in the exact middle of the house
perfectly placed
but
he cannot manage more than 400mbps over this access point
and he suspects
that this is due to the access point being connected to the router over coax.
ip over coax advertises 700mbps‚•πuhm
what if the router is throttling‚•πwhy would it‚•πidk old linux router thingy right so uh
it get lliike‚•πi mean heres the thing‚•πoverheat‚•πso im testing
by running an iperf server on my nextcloud server
which has a GbE connection
to the router‚•πI need to order two power supplies‚•πi tested
from my pi first
which also has a GbE connection to the router
and it got 940 mbps
with iperf
now tho
from that access point
over wifi my phone gets 370 mbps
and over ethernet my phone gets 450 mbps
and my laptop
over ethernet
gets 240 mbps
and over wifi
gets 2 mbps‚•πsigh
that
is a router issue‚•πwhy‚•πjust like
if the wifi is slower
it's either a router issue or your wifi card is horrible
yes that is a‚•πwell my laptop is bad‚•πlaptop wifi
bad
yeah‚•πmy laptop will get 500 mbps over wifi in school
and 1.2 gbps over ethernet
in school
but i tested from my phone
to avoid this issue‚•πuhm
poor wifi network configuration‚•πbut why wouldnt it be the coax
thats the issue‚•πif you
plug into ethernet
on THAT router
what do you get‚•πyou mean on the coax AP
on the coax AP i get 450 mbps to my phone over ethernet‚•πyour phone
has ethernet.‚•πno im using a usb ethernet adapter
for all the tests
on laptop and phone‚•πsigh
uhm
why are intel cpus so cheap idk what to buy anymore‚•πik it is not the bottleneck because it has given me gigabit speeds‚•πok
and the coax router
gives you fast speeds
on your phone?‚•πthe speed i search
is 1gpbs‚•πokay like
i mean
normal speed
not 2mbps
like
more
than that‚•πyes it gives me normal speeds on wifi‚•πokay
what about
your laptop
running lunix‚•πmy laptop runs windows‚•πwhat about
your laptop
running lunix‚•πi dont have it ready atm‚•πliterally just get
a
usb
and
do
things‚•π*sigh‚•πjust do it
and tell me what you see‚•πi have elementary os on a usb stick‚•πdo that then‚•πand i dont think it boots on my laptop‚•πok then use the like
the‚•πmost linuxes dont boot on my laptop‚•πssd‚•πno that ssd is in my pc
and im not turning it off rn
i think i should test my phone's network interface
to see if it can do gigabit‚•πno just‚•πAsdafadagshdahsfs jumper cables
cy is satisfied
because
he just figured out
that the raspberry pi has a fully functional serial console
that is already enabled
and can be accessed on serial0 at 115200 baud
which means
if you need to do network testing on a raspberry pi
and you need to use it "headless"
without a monitor
and networking is not guaranteed
so you cannot use ssh
you can access it over the serial terminal
using a donor arduino
on the Arduino:
you just use a jumper to short the reset pin to ground
which disables the microcontroller
then you connect ground, tx, and rx to the pi
and plug it in to ur computer
then you use putty
the serial terminal is very limited
it is fixed size
and black and white
because the rs232 protocol does not have support for text color or dynamic terminal size
but it works
and cy is happy
corning is the only company allowed to have their logo look like this
because their business is literally glass‚•πLmao
Uh my 5800x just jumped to 4.9 ghz is that normal?‚•πYes
faster?‚•πMy gpu won‚Äôt show in task manager‚•πNah it's too trash for that‚•πIs it seated properly‚•πOur gpu‚•πIt's his now‚•πNo it's still mine‚•πYou guys share a wife?‚•πAnd he's gonna return it‚•πYeah once I get mine

Like you think engineers are dumb... And then you realize there is a whole new level of stupidity at Rosewill
Yes
That looks like a Rosewill employee‚•πcy wants to go to best buy‚•πExcept it's Cy and Cy is smarter than a Rosewill employee‚•πhe wants RAM
and SSD
and a monitor that represents colors‚•πXDR display‚•πsee his dad
gave him a paper for christmas
that said
cy can go to best buy
and spend $200‚•πUr missing a zero there bud‚•πno‚•πGet this
Best display for color
Its only what
Like 4000$‚•πseven and a half
used convertible pontiacs‚•πYea but a pontiac doesnt give u accurate color does it?‚•πtrue
the thing is
the ram and ssd
are gonna be like $200
or maybe $150
total
i also wanna see the pixel 5
but not buy it‚•πWhat ram u getting?
16gb?‚•π16gb‚•πNice‚•πalthough i have to match the speed to my current ram right?‚•πThink so‚•πi also want a 1tb ssd
alternatively tho
i could just get another 512gb‚•πGet this‚•π+ pcie raid card‚•πI dont think u need raid‚•πme neither‚•πGet this‚•πk‚•πCause u have like a 50gb swap‚•πwhich brand tho‚•πThe cheapest one‚•πk‚•πKingston mabye‚•πi currently have the cheapest one

bye‚•πbike pedals are 9/16 of an inch correct?‚•πHi I'm lost‚•πHi‚•πThat's like half an inch
What dimension‚•π?
i mean the size of the hole the pedal fits into in the crank arm thing
cause mine is stripped
so i gotta tap it to 5/8
then add a metal insert‚•πYou mean where the foot thing attaches to the arm‚•πyes‚•πI could imagine that being 9/16‚•πit prob is
its just a hassle to tap it to 5/8‚•πI see‚•πInteresting

interesting‚•πthe troubleshooter is actually working‚•πextremely interesting
ramesh is writing atm‚•πcy is updating windows atm
then hes gonna go to best buy

now that the "get help" is working‚•πI did it‚•πNice
Why?
Ah i see
If i put anything before wildcard its gonna change it right?‚•πyes‚•πNice

Once u start using that side button
U cant go back‚•πthe wheel or the button?‚•πI too have a side button‚•πI want one
The button
On the side‚•πthere are 3
my problem is the scrolling
its sort of
messed up‚•πThe one under ur thumb‚•πoh that one
i have it set to show desktop‚•πI have it set to mission control‚•πidk its just a little off to the left
i have to move my thumb‚•πMine fits right there
Its the forward and back
That i have to move
But i barely use those‚•πi like the forward and back
i have mine not set to that
i have the top one set to pan‚•πI just reprogram them
?
Program them per application‚•πand the bottom one set to pause
so i can essentially scroll using only the top one
and then i have the pause and volume on the lower button and the side wheel
since those are 2 handed gestures on my keyboard‚•πMine change per application‚•πidk like i said my main issue is the scrolling
it sort of
lags‚•π?
Ik it has direction issues
But it lags?‚•πidk i guess im just not used to an inertial scroll wheel‚•πSet it to smart shift‚•πmy old mouse had a light rubber one
so if you let go
it stops
instantly‚•π^‚•πits like that out of the box‚•πIs it?‚•πyes‚•πIdk smart shift is the best
I like both click and speed‚•πramesh is gonna buy stuff at micro center tomorrow‚•πNice

no‚•π:(‚•πshe doens hav eyebrows‚•πNo need to call her out‚•πi wanna make translatebot work‚•πDo it‚•πbut i need to set up some proxy
that doesn't interfere with my ssl
the question is how to do this‚•πMagic‚•πand the answer may be HAproxy‚•πSo magic‚•πyeah
ima read up on haproxy
and ima not go to bed at 2 today
ima do homework
l8r‚•πWow
The links don‚Äôt work‚•πits an xperiment
i spent like 5 hours on it
and didn't spend a second
on making working links
hi
my name is cy‚•πYes
Hussein coming in clutch‚•πsee this is exactly the opposite of what i want
i want ssl non-termination
i want ssl passthrough‚•πCy I have no clue what you‚Äôre talking about
But yes‚•πok essentially this
ssl is a pain in the ass ok
but
my nextcloud server
deals with it for me
so
i want a reverse proxy
that just passes all the ssl stuff through
so nextcloud can deal with it
and not me
then
but
now
since i have a proxy
i can get all the non nextcloud ssl traffic
and deal with it on my experimentation server
without disturbing nextcloud
which my dad uses‚•πYes I now have a 1% understanding‚•πthat is an infinite amount more than before
i feel accomplished
ima watch this‚•πOk gl‚•πwait wtf is this something i did actually worked
haproxy is actually good
i like haproxy
now i can install certbot on my pi
that runs all my sites‚•πI hate
web dev
Fight me‚•πcy is so mad
and it was all gonna work this time
it was all gonna work
and now‚•πuse cloudflare
it will
automatically https‚•πi am
but
certain things
require actual https
and i wanted to set up wildcard ssl
so it would be done
once and for all
can share an ssl certificate‚•πNo
I tried that once
nightmare‚•πwhy‚•πdns records werent updating‚•πno you dont understand it is working
it just wouldnt renew ‚Äîdry-run‚•πthis is annoying
and then
every
single
event
has to be‚•πbecause the python cloudflare version was out of date‚•πput into a queue‚•πbut now
i updated it‚•πAnd wait
this is wrong
wait
stupid
I have to update all the types to Arcs now‚•πand then letsencrypt comes and tells me i cant‚•πsince the reference is being passed into a thread‚•πlike
get the same certificate
more than 5 times per week‚•πand guess what
my refcell
needs to be changed to a mutex
except
that wont work
and then if I use an RwLock that wont work either
actually
an RwLock might work
multithreading is fun‚•πi am going to retrieve my deleted key files from my filesystem‚•πramesh has concluded
an RwLock will work
the final solution was more complex than an RwLock‚•πyogart is almost still a thing
50% chance akhil even remembers that he did that‚•πYOGART
bruh i remember that
why would i not
make it permanent‚•πnothing is permanent
ima listen to dr p

this is cursed‚•π?‚•πnope‚•π?
wdym nope
its an app
that's a web app‚•πidk any ios apps like that‚•πoh
um‚•πtheres no option to download an app
apple doesnt even support downloading apps outside the store‚•πAh ramesh is stupid
he doesn't add the guesses to the list‚•πon eyeohesse‚•πpwa‚•πbut notice how mehdi's site opens as an app whereas mine opens as a website
my mak is almost ready
wow apple is wonderful

tf is this graphics memory
no
no
not that outline
no
my 3mb of gpu memory have failed me i guess‚•πwhy does macos look so ugly‚•πah this
asdfasdf
sdfgsdfgsdfgqasdfg‚•πit looks awful‚•πidk‚•πnow heres the question
can I now
switch to VMware player‚•πidk
use kvm‚•πcuz this is workstation pro‚•πosx-kvm is nice‚•πwell im thinking cuz like
theyre both VMware workstation
so could I just take the files
and run them in player
me when I was an apple user‚•πYes
Young Cy
looks like
1980s cy ngl‚•πso apparently minimizing safari breaks macos
those grafix are too intense
imma give it more processors
it has 4 rn
I giv it 12
and I giv it 16gb ram
wait I have to replace ctrl+c with win+c‚•πyea‚•πim installing edge
the problem is it like locks
every 5 minutes
nope every 2 minutes
its like it has to respring
cuz that's what apple things do
sldhfkjashdlfkjha it dies every time I click anything
i hate how the red x does not actually terminate the app
it just like
minimizes it
alright‚•πwait what
I mean it's higher than I thought it'd be‚•πits the same as mine‚•πthe graphics tho
are like
so bad‚•πgarbae‚•πi tried imessage
um
VMware has some sort of direct memory access
well like software DMA
cuz
it doesn't show up in task manager
but im only at 50% overall memory usage
i am getting the ifone simulator
first i need excode
excode is taking forever to download‚•πits 9gb‚•πits going faster now
wow apple‚•πyou don't know how bad it is?
I already read this
it's funny‚•πits funny that they dont like
or that they do like
put reviews from 3 years ago
as the second review
on their own software‚•πim dying
one is air
the other is dioflourinethane
why is dioflouruoennadsadethane weird
?‚•πi actually used the sequences feature
during lab today‚•πik its useful
but y is it doing this‚•πas;aslkdfj;alskdfj;asldkfj excode‚•πnot 100% yet but whatever‚•πits taking firevir‚•πik how to fix it‚•πi dont understand what you are making‚•πthis uses
ill let you play too
multiplayer
after I fix this
it should work multiplayer‚•πoh wait im on macos 11.0 beta
that's probably why everything is buggy
tell me why this is the icon for file manager
like as a logo ok
but as the icon for the file manager?‚•πMULTIPLAYER WORKS
Cy
can you try my game‚•πyes‚•πand see if you can connect
okay
lemme push the stuff
and see how to get it to work on windows‚•πthis is why you do web dev‚•πno
I hate web dev‚•πso you dont have to make different versions for each os
and have each os‚•πI dont
i just have to build it‚•πalthough you kinda have to do the same thing with web dev
you need mak
to test‚•πloading
Building slowly‚•πshoot i accidentally minimized safari
wait
it didn't break
ok
yes‚•πno‚•πthat only took two and a half hours
the problem is theres no app store‚•πasdfasjfd;jasf
cy
do you have mingw2
I hate windows
I literally hate it‚•πi do‚•πok wait‚•πi also have wsl‚•πwsl
is junk for this‚•πfor what
compiling?‚•πit depends on a library‚•πwhy dont you compile it‚•πi am
so you can
LINK : fatal error LNK1181: cannot open input file 'csfml-graphics.lib'
literally
the file
is there‚•πshoot i minimized safari
and shoot
i did ctrl c instead of win c‚•π?‚•πif you minimize safari the mak locks up for like a minute‚•πOhhhh
Haha
I have smoooth‚•πtrying to do that animation
anyway now i have an iPhone simulator
so i can test things on ios‚•πNice‚•πcy is mad
now his android emulators dont work

what happens‚•πThis is legit a virus‚•πright wait‚•πGl‚•πlemme send you the font

put this in target
then try it

it's not‚•πk it worked‚•πdoes it show a bunch of boxes‚•πyes‚•πare the boxes
filling in‚•πyes‚•πare the attempts changing‚•πyes‚•πok
guess
stuff is not implemented yet
like chosing other certain gthings
also it might do anything
you win
nice
you can also make a game and I'll join
close it
and then just
udpclient.exe
no args‚•πk
guess‚•πlemme see
oh it logs the word‚•πhaha‚•πIt works though
the prototype works
ok thank you for testing
i will deal with that‚•πyou will deal with communism
later‚•πHAHAA
I get it
bye hamachi
you can look at the code if y…ô w√£
it's‚•πU gonna publish to crates?‚•πwhen it works
this is like
REALLY early prototype
cy wil agree‚•πSecure the name‚•πy…ô c√£ l…ôk e √∞…ô c√µ
later‚•πJust make release v0.0.1‚•πno not yet‚•πYea later‚•πshould i make the same thing
with web dev‚•πYes but it'll be less fun‚•πi need to learn how to use sockets‚•π^‚•πwebsockets
this uses like UDP
or something‚•πI also need to learn sockets‚•πOh god‚•πBut im lazy
?‚•πI do
soemthing
and then everyone else be like:
haha‚•πhow does this do the connection
do i create a UDP server
when i make a game?‚•πI aint making what u did dont worry‚•πsigh
I know‚•πthis‚•πidk
i did something‚•πwhat‚•πHes a genius
Why does the rpi flasher take forever‚•πi added stuff‚•πa low quality video of cy very sadly poking the black screen of his google pixel on stock android 11
in dark mode
cy likes pixels
cy's pixel is broken
sad pixel
its not worth $90 to fix it tho
not until i stare at it long enough that it becomes worth it
scrcpy is a thing‚•πI told you about this before‚•πbut it defines a new category of hand-eye coordination‚•πI like scrcpy‚•πto poke a black screen
in the right spot‚•πyes‚•πits easier than it seems
but‚•πi like it
what do you think‚•πi see you dug that out‚•πim looking for a screenshot
Gas laws
fun‚•πanyone do this one?‚•πima try it and see what I get‚•πno i got it now‚•πok‚•πi can help u tho if u need‚•πnah‚•πk‚•πchem easy‚•πwell this one it was like
wet gas
and im like
is the dry gas
does it have a different volume
cuz u remove the water
but no‚•πyea, we had lab question on that‚•πi didnt‚•πand I had to ask the almighty alankar‚•πhaha‚•πbruh
cy‚•πyes‚•πi am trying to host my website
like small html thing‚•πi can do that for you‚•πhow i do‚•πits just an html page?‚•πyuh, just for seeing how to host it‚•πum‚•πthen ima do some css and java script‚•πyou can use hosting providers
or
u can ask me
and i host it on my server
bc it ez‚•πi wanna try and self host it
for learnz‚•π„Öó‚•πbut when i finish‚•πyou can do that but u need port forwarding‚•πcan u host it‚•πand nginx‚•πi made a port‚•πand a pi
to run all the time‚•πok‚•πu hav domain?‚•πno‚•πsend html‚•πbut im trying to get free one from github
ok
i stored file in one drive so it takin a bit do download‚•πi see
do the draggy drop to the tewegwam‚•πfinally
it is just a giant picture of elon musk
and words
oooooooo‚•πomg
that is
the most
beautiful‚•πyuh
how i host tho
yup‚•πum
you can use GitHub pages
you can use
cloudflare pages
you can use
replit for dynamic/service sites
you can self host
or‚•πthen ima self host‚•πyou can use Cy2 Hosting
you can just give me ur domain
then i put it on ur domain
in my nginx config‚•πim trying to get a domain from GitHub student dev thing
ok
yup
i was like, what is the best thing to write
and i was like, that‚•πewon musc‚•πyuh
ima add css
and see what happen‚•πthen when you get a domain
you can put it on cloudflare
for easy https
or
force me to use certbot
which i need to learn
and i already learned‚•πima try cloudflare‚•πover break
yes that is better
although it is not actually secure
which doesn't matter‚•πi mean
if they wanna see elon musk smoking pot‚•πits only secure between users and cloudflare
so it appears secure‚•πgo ahed‚•πbut then
between cloudflare and your server
its not secure‚•πo‚•πbut no one cares about that
unless there is user data being transmitted
so they offer this "flexible" option
they call it
so u dont have to deal with actual ssl
they just do the ssl for u
via the proxy‚•πooooo thats nice‚•πmy sites use this
although some will no longer use this
such as readybeluga
hatchboxpla
as well as my secure webhooks
like the one for translatebot
which doesn't work because im lazy, i procrastinate, and im disorganized
all at once
multitasking
oh god i just looked at mikey site kode
its better than the site‚•πyuh‚•πhey ppl
this good
sine it
Ramesh doesn't want to
but it is good
so sine it‚•πmy zoom client is dum‚•πYou're locked in a room with a friend... permanently. This means... forever. This is someone that you're close with or are attached to (this doesn't necessarily mean romantically interested, but that could count).

... The room isn't bad or anything. You'll get supplies, food, and stuff like that. Books, whatnot. You can even get a computer, but you can't access the internet on it. It's rather large and sufficient for two people. But there are no windows, and you'll never get to see the outside again with your own eyes.

But there is a way out. And there's a way out for your friend as well. üî™üëÄ

Kill your friend, live with the emotional pain, and you will get to see the world again. And vice versa. Or be trapped in the room forever.

Would you kill your friend?‚•πsure‚•πmuch kill‚•πquality response
why
Could you stand seeing your friend in that pool of blood?‚•πthe lack of windows‚•πYou get a computer‚•π^‚•πoh

the French direct translation is
who says new year says resolutions, good resolutions‚•π...
Makes sense‚•πit does but its nothing like the indirect translation
who says new year says resolutions = it wouldn't be a new year without resolutions‚•πWhoever
Maybe
uh
Ce ne serai pas un nouvel an sans r√©solutions, bonnes r√©solutions!‚•πhi, resolution
hi-resolution
my name is cy‚•πHi resolution, im dad‚•πim listening to electro swing‚•πThe playlist?‚•πno
this song
this album
i like the first song
its one of my favorites
but im listening to the other songs
in the album
this one is really good‚•πsounds like something out of cuphead‚•πidk what that is‚•πits an ‚Äú80s‚Äù theme gamed
music and look wise‚•πthis is not 80s
electro swing
is like‚•πits not the 80s
that was just a random year
but its similar‚•πi suppose
these are some pretty calm ones
idk if theyre even swing
they go slower
swing is usually noticeably more than 120 bpm‚•πSwings not based on speed‚•πno its not
but
it plays a part‚•πi can swing a thing at 70 but yea it wouldnt sound good‚•πidk what exactly defines swing‚•πoff beat
instead of hitting 1 - 2 - 3 - 4
1 - 2 - - 3 - 4
or 1 ‚Äî 2 3 4‚•πum
im not totally sure what you mean‚•πu know a metrenome
how it clicks‚•πno i know music
but like‚•πits adding slight "spaces"
where u dont adhere to the straight quarters‚•πhold on a moment
but doesn't pop music do that too‚•πyea
lot of music swings‚•πbut i think the "swing" style is more to do with other aspects‚•πi dont know much about the genre entirely, but ive learned how to ‚Äúswing‚Äù notes‚•πwait
hold on‚•πRustacean?
Recording audio?‚•πi wanted to share the first 1.5 seconds of this song
it didn't work
but i think i see what you mean there
DUM dum dum DUM DUUUUUM DUM‚•πyea its kinda like that‚•πi think what makes electro swing sound the way it does tho
is like
the combination‚•πcause its jazzy‚•πwell that
but
combined with old record filters and electronic sound
which contrast‚•πthat
its also prob not in standard
Jazz is the most annoying genre to play
cause triples‚•πthere was this rhythm
that i had to try and figure out
for a piano arrangement i was making
hold on
this song
the bumbumbum in the background
at exactly 30 seconds‚•πhmm
thats an intresting beat‚•πthis song uses that same beat
at the beginning
well a variation of it
i think theres a 4 beat pattern and an 8 beat pattern‚•πthats different i would say
yea thats nothing too special‚•πikson uses the 8 beat i think
no that's the length‚•πi know
eigths on one, quarters on the second‚•πthose are not eigths tho‚•πthey r probably 9ths‚•πthis is what i got when i finally got it‚•πYea sounds about right‚•πkords are kool‚•πkords are annoying
luckily i cant do cords‚•πwhat are the 4 7 kords
in order‚•πi no play piano‚•πi think its major dominant minor and diminished‚•πi dont know what those mean
i just bang something and make music‚•πdoes Cy like cute girls
Ah
the people have disappeared‚•πHaha‚•πsee
I just inquired about cy's sexuality‚•πHey, please listen to my Aroundsound recording of 'Evening Recording'. Click on the attachment to listen.‚•πI aint downloading something as sketchy as that‚•πits me playing Prince‚•πaroundsound?

listen‚•πlisten
it has too many mistakes
that version‚•πjust cover them up‚•πi have like 26 versions

I figured out how to solve this issue
but
im lazy
so im repeeating code‚•πnice‚•πor

at that time stamp
and be blown away‚•πnvm
rust
wont let me repeat code
screw this
how tf am i supposed to do this wtf
this is so dumb‚•πdont use rust‚•πthat is not an option‚•πwhy‚•πand it's not rust's fault
it's the

for being designed poorly
wait‚•πThink I‚Äôm gonna cry‚•πDont do it
Why
Why a surface with mac‚•πToo late‚•πWhich one?
Please not Big Sur‚•πWdym

huh‚•πcy aime les femmes‚•πInteresting‚•πcy aime les femmes‚•πramesh loves women‚•πwait
les gar√ßons aime les femmes‚•πboys love women‚•πuhh
not garcon
uhh
hommes aime femmes‚•πmen love women‚•πyes
there
simple

Sai‚•πha‚•πCy‚•πRamesh
Someone, likely Ramesh, has said something that will not be translated.
–°y loves women‚•πHa‚•π?‚•πHa‚•πwhat‚•πHa
Ha‚•πhold up‚•πIm a genius
im a hckin genius‚•πtf is this‚•π:D‚•πCy
wait‚•πHJa‚•πCy‚•πThis gives me a grand total
of
20 months‚•πasdfasdf‚•πRamesh

20 monht‚•π–°y‚•π–°y
–°y‚•πwhat should i set as my status
on discord‚•π–°y‚•π–°y‚•πHa
HA
HAHAHAHAHAHAAH‚•πCy‚•πRamesh‚•π*sigh‚•πdon't
even‚•π–°y‚•πbother‚•π–°y‚•πramesh‚•π–°y‚•πRamesh‚•πthere we go‚•π—Å—É is an interesting person‚•πjust give up
I can agree
to not
say the weird things
why cant rust be like c++
and have an impl file
and a definition file‚•πk i added that
—Å—É‚•πare‚•πHa‚•π—Å—É is yellow‚•πramesh is yellow
–°–£ is interesting
c—É is interesting‚•π*Cyghing yet?‚•π*sigh
c—É‚•πSomeone, likely Ramesh, has said something that will not be translated.‚•πk problem mostly solved
i remember when i had to do this at the 4h fair
with calum‚•π...‚•πhe kept
posting
obscene
and innapropriate
comments
about me
so
i had to implement something
that being said
c-y is yellow‚•πc-y is yellow‚•πbut at least it has to look weird
its kode
just reading the rust docs‚•πhck
im making a sticker set for this
Ossoff hasn't won yet
things can still change
really‚•πdemocracie‚•πthat's how biden won‚•πi dont like democracie‚•πwhat do you like
autocracie?‚•πno‚•πtechnocracie‚•πyou need a government that is too complex to become partisan
you need a government which can act quickly
but correctly
in the long term
democracy lately is not government for the people
its government for half the people
isnt he a republican
mitch‚•πoh is he talking about the election of 1776 now
Lmao
very funny
the protesters got into the capital i think
people are evacuating
security threats
interesting‚•πcy is desperately trying to comprehend python
websockets
server
he cannot understand how what where who
what‚•πyep
they breached the capital‚•πits like a solid 5 lines of code
When cy tries to use venv‚•πwhen cy uses windoze
use linux
it literally does not crash
i mean i have literally barely ever experienced a crash in my life
ive had it fail to boot‚•πlinux requires maintenance‚•πive had it have other issues but ive very very rarely had it panic
use arch‚•πyou have to be a professional to even install that‚•πno
I can do it‚•πand it doesn't run half the things I need to run‚•πI can even do it‚•πlike‚•πIts stupid simple‚•πall of ms office
for example‚•πThe hardest is partitioning
I mean then‚•πor fusion360‚•πRamesh this is ur expertise‚•πthe other problem like I said is that it requires maintenance
so I have to learn how to maintain it‚•πit's not‚•πand update things‚•πthat hard‚•πand all that‚•πliterally
yay -Syu
is not
hard
to remember‚•πbut I have no clue what that does‚•πramesh can literally do school‚•πits all this rather cryptic stuff
you have to look everything up
nothing just directly makes sense‚•πsigh
once you use it‚•πand its really easy to mess things up‚•πfor some time
you get used to it
ramesh can do school‚•πsince its so complicated‚•πtake 5 AP classes
and use linux
without faililng them‚•πRamesh spends his time on linux
as opposed to other things
he could spend his time on‚•πlike what
getting friends?
I have a few and I like them a lot‚•πamong other things
idk whenever I use linux
it breaks within a few days
of me trying to do stuff with it
then I dont know what to do
whether its the ui‚•πyes
you should
read‚•πor the software‚•πhow linux works
it's a book
i read it over the summer in 8th grade
was good
no
7th grade‚•πim not reading a book on my operating system thank you‚•πI read it
I literally am fine with linux‚•πu havent read one?
i read one on mac lion or whatever its called‚•πidk the thing is windows is fairly simple
so its not hard to fix when it breaks
and all the updates and management and stuff is all graphical
so I dont have to look things up‚•πit is‚•πevery time I wanna do anything‚•πgraphical on linux too
it works fine for me‚•πand it has miracast
and nearby share
idk I could use linux for development stuff
which actually brings me to the other thing it doesn't have
hibernate
on windows
I can hibernate
boot into linux
then
shut down linux‚•πwhat does hibernate even do?‚•πboot back into windows
and everything
is exactly
where
i left
it‚•π^‚•πit stores the state
of your system‚•πhuh‚•πits like saving the state of a vm
but for an actual os‚•πhuh‚•πso if i have 27 apps open
and im running servers
and i have work open
and things are happening
and i need to shut down my computer
or boot into linux for a moment
i can hibernate
and not loose the state of everything i was doing
and on my laptop
it means
that if i leave it closed for more than 3 hours
in sleep mode
it will go into hibernation
and use no power
to get practically infinite standby time
Ramesh is gonna be like
oh theres this experimental linux command you can run
that does almost that
therefore this is not an issue‚•πtried searching storming
then
this happened‚•πmurka
so far only murka website uses nginx
i have looked at many websites‚•πok this is bad
i literally
did this without thinking
faire une erreur
CY‚•πremember my computer bluescreened‚•πcan you please just install linux
thanks‚•πno‚•πyes
or else‚•πinstead
i will run my bot
on an actual always on server‚•π^‚•πonce i have time to deal with ssl‚•πcygh
but remember
linux
or else‚•πi just bit my lip 3 times‚•πgood‚•πin half an hour‚•πthats because‚•πthis is sad‚•πwindows bsodded
linux
is what you need‚•πlast time i used linix‚•πLinux‚•πi forgot to update it
and then‚•πYes‚•πthat was it‚•πuse arch‚•πi was done‚•πthen it wont do that
yes
use
arch
or if you cant
manjaro
that has an installer‚•πthen i have to reboot
every time
i wanna go to school‚•πuh
why‚•πfourth time my lip
a;sdlkfja;sdlkfj;alskdjfasd;lkfj
chewing gum
to run school apps
like ms office
and zoom
idk i gain less from linux as a desktop os than i loose‚•πoh right
zoom sucks on linux
that's a zoom issue though‚•πwell regardless of who's issue it is‚•πidk maybe you haven't seen the advantage it is‚•πsuch as‚•πit used to not
not having to deal with bsods‚•πthey are almost irrelevant
they happen very rarely‚•πnot having to use wsl‚•πand i have never lost any data
wsl is totally fine‚•πnot having to deal with pirating software‚•π?‚•πgetting better performance
finding software generally
since linux has nice software‚•πi have more than I need already‚•πthats free
I have a 5900X
Im cool right‚•πi mean
its what you do with it that counts
my windows issues are not very many
windows works fine‚•πor else‚•πRamesh clearly
likes
macos‚•πwhy do you think this‚•πhe is not recommending akhil
switch to linix‚•πno because akhil
doesnt
hate desktop linux
like you do‚•πi dont
hate
anything‚•πIn fact‚•πi just
dont feel like switching‚•πAkhil wants to learn about Linux‚•πwithout much of a purpose
i do too‚•πlearning experience‚•πin servers‚•πif you switch
you learn‚•πand backend‚•πboring
boring‚•πlinux desktop is just not really very
relevant
or useful
to me‚•πthats what everyone says‚•πbut what do i gain?‚•π"I would rather drop linux support than macos support"‚•πi lose so much‚•πlike what
microsoft edge?‚•πhibernation for example
miracast‚•πwhat is hibernation again‚•πms office‚•πbtw linux has hibernation‚•πits like saving the state of a vm‚•πthis is useless‚•πbut for ur os‚•πi wrote a 135 page story in ms office
do you think i care
about‚•πwhat‚•πms office‚•πdo you want
me to use‚•πlibreoffice‚•πhell no
that is trash
literal trash
i tried it‚•πyou think so
when
it was trash 4 years ago
i refused to switch to linux because it didn't have ms office‚•πalso i use onedrive‚•πthen i switched to linux
theres an app for that
but u gotta pay‚•πim not payin‚•πits like
5 dollars‚•πi use autohotkey‚•πwhich im sure you have
for what
typing schwas?
…ô‚•πturning on and off my lights‚•πah‚•πand dimming them‚•πthat can be done easily
without ahk
also
i think theres a linux ahk
clone‚•πwith what?‚•πcustom keyboard shortcuts‚•πyou are telling me
the settings application
can place http requests‚•πyes‚•πon keystrokes‚•πyou can tell it
to run scripts
that place http requests
on keystrokes
when you press keys‚•πmiracast‚•π1 what is that
two google it
i bet it's there‚•πmiracast is wireless display
i dont use it as much now that i temporarily have a second monitor
but‚•πhere
havce fun‚•πwhen i dont have that monitor‚•πtheres a miracast‚•πno
the windows implementation
is the best
it also support input
it saved me so much hassle at drama club
like you do not understand‚•πliterally ive never heard of miracast‚•πthat's because you're a linux person
who writes on paper
and uses rust‚•πso
that's insulting‚•πno
its not
its just‚•πit is
fight me‚•πthere are different ppl‚•πdoesnt mean‚•πi happen to be of the type‚•πyou have to stay closed-minded about changing‚•πwho knows what miracast is
im not closed minded
i have tried linux
several times
as you know
and from driver glitches
to installing software‚•πYes
on your‚•πto just installing anything
or booting‚•πi have literally
never
encountered issues with linux‚•πthe problem with linux
is its like doing coding‚•πif you use it enough‚•πbut to use your os‚•πyes‚•πyou have to look everything up‚•πdo you like coding‚•πyes but only when i have to‚•πwhat if
instead of opening adobe
reader
and searching for buttons
i do
bam i have a joined pdf now‚•πok but whats to say i cant use pdftk in wsl
cuz that's the other thing‚•πwsl is slow‚•πi have wsl
no‚•πi dont like wsl‚•πits not
and it runs all the linux commands
so if i need to use linux‚•πyeah ok‚•πi open wsl‚•πok
fine
try that‚•πi could just install firefox on windows‚•πtry running my hangman application
see how easy it is‚•πalmost all the graphical stuff is available for windows‚•πto get it to work
bye
i have to do things
it is a nightmare
to compile things on windows
i dont have to deal with stuff on linux‚•πi dont compile things‚•πi literally tried linux since i was trying to compile an open source game engine‚•πnot often that is‚•πi compile my rust code
i like not spending 10 hours making mysql work on windows‚•πthen use wsl‚•πi didnt
have wsl‚•πwell i do‚•πwhen i switched to linux
now im used to linux
so i dont really care‚•πwhat you need to understand
is we have different needs‚•πi hate windows adware
yes but you see
i still use windows
every day
i dont like windows
but i know it has some benefits
just like desktop linux can have benefits‚•πi dont use linux
because‚•πthat you refuse to acknowledge‚•πi never have to‚•πbecause your "needs are different"‚•πeasier to compile stuff
yes
customization
running linux-only server stuff on your desktop‚•πno
more than that‚•πlike what‚•πbut you'd have to use it‚•πthat i cant get
from wsl‚•πthe gui software is better‚•πno
it is not‚•πdoes windows explorer
have tabs
huh‚•πwdym tabs‚•πTABS‚•πno but it actually lets me access directories
that the linix one doesnt‚•πwdym‚•πthe other problem with linux
is like‚•πhidden folders?
control h‚•πthere are too many ways to install things‚•πLike‚•πwell say i wanna install certbot cloudflare plugin
pip3
apt‚•πno
dont‚•πsnap‚•πuse pip3‚•πgit clone‚•πdont use snap
use apt‚•πbut if i use pip3
and i forgot‚•πthen dont‚•πthat certbot was installed from apt‚•πuse pip3
ever‚•πthen
it breaks everything‚•πfor that stuff
if you learned about linux
you will eventually
know how to manage this stuff‚•πbut why learn linux‚•πor not complain about it
and just solve it without thinking‚•πhow does it speed up my workflow‚•πhmm
try
compiling
my game
and see how long it takes to set up your environment on windows
vs on linux‚•πtry
editing‚•πor‚•πmy onenote
notebooks‚•πsure
i will
give me one‚•πwith a pen‚•πill just do it online
i have a pen
also, I use xournal
it works‚•πon the desktop linux is a bit more promising than on laptop
since there are less drivers
and touch
and stuff‚•πworks
i tried it
i was surprised
it actually is usable on ubuntu now
and not glitchy to hell‚•πidk I just need access to my OneNote and word
and onedrive
those are neccesary‚•πonline
onlyoffice
xournal‚•πxournal is some obscure thing‚•πno
it's not
and it works horribly on windows‚•πthat doesn't real time sync‚•πtry it on linux‚•πand in 20 years‚•πill still have it
since ill have backed up my precious hard drive‚•πOneNote will be usable
since its popular
xournal‚•πno it's not
literally
no one I know
No one I know‚•πits a ms office app‚•πuses OneNote
other than you‚•πmy math teacher
and all her friends
since she likes it so much
she told them all‚•πIdk
im not one to promote vendor lock-in
I have to do my spanish homework and sleep
bye‚•πidk its just better
bye
enjoy your linux
ima make websockets connect-four‚•πenjoy copying me‚•πim copying a lot of ppl actually
visvam from 4h reminded me of websockets
and you reminded me of the fun of real time games
and i was about to do my real time with mqtt
but then i was like
websockets are probably simpler and better
also i was gonna use them in a 3.js app
for real time interaction between users of the 3d environment
before you showed me your thing
but yea im copying you‚•πwhy so long‚•πidk
by the way
u wanna see copying‚•πno
doing work
ramesh
is going to use a mac
for the next
10 days
he wants to see cy's response‚•πcy literally doesn't care
if you use a mac
he does not really care which operating system you use
and he does not hate apple
could someone
open that page
k wait
you see 2 users
right‚•πi mean yea‚•πnow 3‚•πi see two connected users
yea‚•πnow close it
um‚•πclosed it‚•πit worked
i see 2 now
but
hold on
meh
the kode runs
it produces ugly error messages
but apparently that's how its supposed to work
according to the documentation‚•πdoes this mean apple developers are just incompetent and cant support things right?‚•πum
idk the context
idk sure if other ppl come‚•πakeel is coming‚•πits at 2:30 rite
the server is down rn
i need to fix a bug
hey someone‚•πConnection error please refresh‚•πum
refresh‚•πI win‚•πhold on a moment
ok hold on
use chrome
i dont have wss set up yet
and safari requires wss
so does Samsung internet
aashhdahsdhahahhhh
error
errors
what do you see‚•πerror
please refresh‚•πyou were connected for a second
i think
um‚•πits broken‚•πi suppose i need wss
hold on
maybe cloudflare
can bail me out of having to do actual work‚•πis fun
to have infinite turns‚•πyes
oh wait i think i tried cloudflare wss proxying before
and it didn't work
time to get nginx involved
and certbot
i dont like certbot
its mainly a linux and python issue though
they keep breaking my certbot‚•πclonezilla is now downloading‚•πhola
did u guys go to rooms?‚•πare u in komp sci
no not yet
almost‚•πill just join the room‚•πk‚•πim lazy to join the lounge‚•πhi workspace 4‚•πhad to get off‚•πi see
ima make konnekt 4 work
in case it wasnt clear‚•πjunk‚•πHola‚•πit works sorta now
btw
you dont have to click toggle anymore
it just
leaves them on
under the blur
wait
lets play an actual game
ha i win‚•πwdym
i won‚•πactually idk now
NO
this game was RIGGED
i will march into your capital
to prove it‚•πhh‚•πha i win‚•πRIGGED
RIGGED I TELL U‚•πopponent sanity lost
hang tight
if you rejoin
it saves
the state
rejoin‚•πCant‚•πwhy‚•πAm about to take a shower‚•πah
ok‚•πIll be back dont worry‚•πima text alankar
do u wanna play‚•πno
not now
Yes‚•πoh god
hey ramesh
1 game‚•πl8r‚•πfine‚•πi will though
remind me like tomorrow night
if i dont
before that
and i will play
and if i dont use my words against me‚•πitll be actually good tomorrow night‚•πill work on multihangman tomorrow night too‚•πk‚•πGame night‚•πyes‚•πYes‚•π3 player connect four?‚•πYes
Tic tac toe, four in a row!‚•πthe problem is i wrote my code for 2
thinking
who would ever
want 3 player
connect four
who has 2 friends‚•πme‚•πall available at once
i was gonna add more games tho‚•πif someone does something embarassing‚•πso more than 2 ppl can be on the server‚•πand covers it up
and you realize they did something embrassing
would you point it out to them‚•πHell no‚•πwhy‚•πLike why‚•πits a hard question‚•πThey probably know what they did‚•πbecause like‚•πwhat if it will answer a question
or is of
personal import‚•πif you dont tell them
then they are wondering if you noticed
but
if you tell them
they might feel more embarrassed‚•πsigh
ramesh is an idiot
okay‚•πi would say dont
but
if you do‚•πthats what I thought‚•πreassure them
that its fine‚•πwhat if it's really not‚•πCySocialSupport‚•πHell no
sorry
that was too blunt
I'm not saying that you're not social
it's just like
details‚•πyes‚•πramesh
no give details‚•πYes
U will be fine‚•πYes
the thing about a bad decision is
it's not really a bad decision ever‚•πU cant take it back‚•πif you learn to be a better person
from it‚•πOr that‚•πits looking good‚•πcygh‚•πit also isnt garbage‚•πakhil might have seeen
what i would have said
here‚•πI may have‚•πbut i didnt
it seems like a bad idea‚•πI may not have‚•πno bad
terrible
no
bad‚•πwhat‚•πur not supposed to be allowed to do anything
why
is it leting you‚•πEveryone is red‚•πno
this happened earlier
hold on
when someone joins
and i have my red and yellow going
that person becomes red
then
when they leave
both mine become red‚•πHaha‚•πhi i write kode‚•πThat was a good title tho‚•πyes‚•πObscure‚•πno one got it
sadge
saying
"love is sad" is too clich√©‚•πimagine actually using lighthouse and getting 100% on seo so ppl actually see ur results
alright not bad
Ramesh scored higher than me
in performance and best practices‚•πWhat does accessibility mean
how about
oh did they kill that‚•πwhats the best website you know‚•πNice one google‚•πthat's not 3.js‚•πIdk
Yes‚•πHa‚•πso
i like lighthouse‚•π√ái√∞√Æ‚•πramesh
lets play connect 4‚•πno
later‚•πakhil
lets play connect 4‚•πlater‚•πaw
cy is confused
ah cy fixed his issue‚•πNice
Should i store username and password data in the keychain
Or a json‚•πwdym
for what‚•πI need to store URL, username and password data for logins
i can either store them in the os keychain‚•πfor a website?‚•πcli‚•πyou wanna store all your passwords
im sorry i need more context‚•πok so im making a cli tool to allow remote turn on and of off servers‚•πahhhh‚•πi need the servers ip, username and password to do so
i can either take the data and store it in the os keychain
or make a json and put it all in there‚•πhow are you doing that tho
do the servers have an api?‚•πssh‚•πwait
so‚•πu can send a command through ssh‚•πyou can ssh into the BMC‚•πyea
atleast mine does‚•πand so you need to store the ssh passwords
ok
um‚•πkeychain is secure‚•πif the ssh is not exposed
to the world
i would say
dont worry
use json‚•πk‚•πand dont make the password anything that is used anywhere else
for anything important
wait
my server does that too‚•πyea all servers with a fancy card thingy do it‚•πwell mine doesn't have a fancy card‚•πits just its not linux
u need to use weird commands‚•πi have SuperMicro IPMI‚•πyea IPMI is a standard
but its bad‚•πyou have iDRAC‚•πyea‚•πtbh
i dont need to turn my server on or off
i just leave it on
alla time‚•πi do
i turn on and off at times‚•πit runs a website
so‚•πreboot it and stuff‚•πthey are redesigning windows
i will finally get my rounded corners
now that Panos is in charge of windows‚•πhuh
i want
but i dont wanna update my mac‚•πwdym u want‚•πrounded corners‚•πu hav rounded corners‚•πwell more round‚•πno the windows ones are not gonna be hugely round
8px probably‚•πmacs is like 4
it barely looks rounded‚•πbut the main thing is like‚•πactually u know what i want‚•πthey will use
consistent
design
what‚•πsee that fckin edge‚•πah
yes
strong words for strong edges‚•πits garbage
i hate it
it looks awful‚•πon windows i can enable or disable the edge
i can make it be my accent color‚•πI wish‚•πwell i could
if windows was activated
which its not‚•πspotify has a worse one
activate it‚•πso im stuck with hot pink / orange
salmon
color
as my accent
in dark mode
with the edge disabled
which tbh is not too bad‚•πyea doesnt sound bad‚•πthe thing is‚•πshould i do a fresh install of macos?‚•πthe only thing
with windows
is that
you cant change the personalization through settings
but
every other way works
and so
my lenovo
was in dark mode
and it synced over
after about a month
and backgrounds
can be changed from the photos app
i mean
how much
stuff do you have
also what does that solve‚•πnothing‚•πthen why do it‚•πi just wanna kinda clean the drive
and set up stuff
like vagrant and start using virtual env
oh god‚•πno this is like
good‚•πi dont let my drive go less than 50 gb‚•πthis is the largest my free space gets
the main reason being‚•πi already did a mass exodus of stuff‚•πthat windows updates take up 20gb‚•πhuh‚•πso im forced to free it
until the windows update is complete
then i go into settings
because
windows when you do a major update
it actually stores the previous version
so if you dont like or have compatibility issues with the new version
you can click one button
and go back‚•πthats nice‚•πbut i have never needed to do that‚•πwhen mac os updates the bridge also updates‚•πso i go into settings‚•πand its cancer to go back‚•πand tell it to purge that old version
bridge?‚•πidk what it is exactly
but it includes the T2 chip and the touchbar
to go back u can always restore a previous os version
but to make it work u need to also bring the bridge back one verison‚•πi see‚•πand to do that u need another mac with the os u r downgrading to‚•πon windows theres no real other way to downgrade
than to use this
option
but
i think you can just find old os versions online‚•πyea‚•πor you could archive them yourself
this was actually a big thing when they wanted everybody to upgrade from windows 7 or 8 to windows 10
they were like
if you dont like it
you can just go back
anyway ill be waiting, Panos, for my file explorer that doesn't look and feel like trash
whats fun is i might actually get that
in a preview build
on my laptop
cuz i think its running the windows dev channel‚•πhuh
i want them
i need hdds‚•πhere
ill send you some
you can take em outta the screen‚•πGracias‚•πcan we get a pic of akhil wearing a sombrero
with some maracas
singing
"gracias"‚•πHaha
I want to see this‚•πwith mexican music playing in the background‚•πI dont have any of those tho
This is great
Some one Photoshop this‚•πidk that many people who photoshop‚•πIdk anybody
Besides like 1 person‚•πyeh same
thanks
for taking
literal

Cause nix has mac support‚•πno real linux
lmao
imagine actually having a brain‚•πYay‚•π*sigh
highway in japnaese is "bypass"?‚•πIsnt it bypass in a lot of places?‚•πidk‚•πthat sounds about right‚•πI thought europe itself calls it the bypass‚•πimplement turns

rust‚•πok but the web works on js
so‚•πI hate js
also
you can write rust to work in runtime web
wasm
*sigh
now everyone is going to do this‚•π?‚•π?‚•πakhil you didn't use the command‚•πwasm‚•πto make chips float‚•πi tried
it no work
so i gave up
more like i couldnt find it‚•πwhat
you open dev tools
go to console
paste it in
and replace r and c with row and column
gl in cybersecurity
hacking things
yes‚•πsee im lazy‚•πima make my own search page
so i can use google
without ads
idk how to really do it tho‚•πsigh‚•πi need to be able to parse html‚•πdid you know

no search something more specific
with no card‚•πlike what
tell me‚•πsecure websockets nginx not working‚•π"google pixel 5 screen protector"‚•πhmm
now they dont show up for me
they are intermittent
but what happens is this‚•πidk what you are using‚•πso it loads the results
right
then
it waits
a second
then
shows the ads
in place of the results
so right when you're about to click
websockets are fast
i wanna do a speedtest‚•πsigh‚•πi did one in my house
but that is not representative
so ima use onnna u
but i needa make it work so hold on
hi someone open this
dont click the button yet
tell me once you have
actually yknow what just go for it
click the button
as a test
can you open my page‚•πNot at my laptop‚•πoh‚•πIll click when im back at my desk‚•πwhen‚•πidea
make a thing
that records windows on linux
like
i can press a button and it will select a window
and i can record an mp4/gif of it
and upload it to doggo‚•πHuh
Intresting
Its not awfully hard
Its just auto window recording‚•πit is hard
try it‚•πcan you open
my page‚•πno‚•πwhy

bi-directional
so half were to me
half were to you‚•πhuh‚•πwhich comes conveniently to 60fps
on a standard home internet
my phone on cellular got 45 fps‚•πi spammed the button like 15-20 times
so‚•πyeah it was not nice at first
here we do again
reload
and click
once‚•πdone‚•πwhat
?‚•πi pressed‚•πhold on
that time everything failed
on my end
one more time‚•πle pressed‚•πyeah so what happens is it lags a little at the start
which is interesting
that time I got 56 fps‚•πch
akhil
wor wya‚•πShallan flashback
With Davar and Helaran‚•πAh
I see
you should read tonight
and get to moash‚•πI shall‚•πYayy‚•πAlso does the rust thing i sent u a while back work?
Like it turns on and off stuff‚•πill test it before tonight ends
i dont
have my server plugged in
ill definitely test it tho‚•πAlmight‚•πYES GOOD GIRL
is apple gdpr compliant?
if so
how do I request my imessage data‚•πIt is
Idk‚•πk so
i dont actually know the password for my apple id's email
k nvm
*sigh‚•πAh yes‚•πthe best gift apple
would be
if I had never made this account
oh well‚•πok so this is gonna be interesting
so
ima stream
accelerometer data
from phone
to pc
with websockets‚•πI like that
facebook is stupid
they like data
how do i kill my cursed clipboard history
ok
i fixed my cursed clipboard history
sorry
is there audio
in this video‚•πno‚•πok
i thought this was a linux problem
speshul user territory‚•πsudo audio start
sudo is best command‚•πsudo akhil‚•πwelp
guess i ran with admin
but what do i do now
How did u get linode for free‚•πhello people
my name is cy
and i made another website‚•π....
Cy
This
Is what is called an addiction
Please get help
From professionals‚•πno now were in a different territory
not design
this is
websockets
well not yet
so you see
on your phone
go to‚•πNo no this is what they all say
U went back to this
U made another
Its an addiction‚•πalright its an addiction
so is coffee
and America runs on it
so
what happens when you go to the site
do you get numberz‚•πNo‚•πwhat do you get‚•πI get undefined‚•πopen it in regular safari‚•πI did‚•πhmm‚•πPretty sure websites cant access my sensor data
Cause sekurity‚•πno no there is a different issue
um
i mean heres the thing
first it wasnt working in chrome or Samsung internet
on my phone
until i enabled https on the site
so maybe
theres some other security check i have to do for safari
yeah so on safari
you have to ask the user for permission
gimme a sec
can you go to the website
and click the "make it work on ios" button‚•πYea it works‚•πwait it does
that's good
now i can start streaming it‚•πHe has to do it slowly i think‚•πhey ramesh‚•πwbat‚•πon your phone
and click make it work
hi is anyone there
*sigh‚•πthis would be a message

this would be a message
ws: connected
Null error
not iOS
undefined‚•πyes
but
on your phone
b'cuz it needs sensor data‚•πlater‚•πfine
i mean i already tested it
with samuel‚•πi gotta reboot my linode‚•πso my thing reads sensor data now
so now what to do with that...
i must go
bye‚•πi will give you your sensor data soon
getting there
you keep complaining about certbot‚•πthat is wonderful
now
tell me
how
to get certbot's cloudflare plugin
to actually do
what it hkin says
in the docs
and read an api token
rather than asking me
for complete access to my account
even after i have installed all the right versions of everything
hi my name is cy
i spehl‚•πwhy
do you use
cloudflare plugin‚•πi want a wildcard
what if i actually need one
like not out of laziness‚•πok
uhm
you use the certbot dns plugin
not cloudflare right‚•πum
i want it to auto update‚•πok fine imma try
see what happens
later‚•πok but listen‚•πi gotta fix this program‚•πits gonna ask you
for an email
and an api key
but that is insecure
and
they have added a more secure option
where you give it a token
to access only one domain and only parts of it
not you entire cloudflare account
that's what i wanna use
im not putting all my cloudflare access in there‚•πok fine
wait‚•πhaha‚•πyou cant
well maybe
if he syncs to goodreads‚•πits honor precalc
kinda like google's Phone X
a mysteriously close iPhone X lookalike‚•πI do
I always sync to goodreads‚•πits a dual skreenshot‚•πOooooo‚•πCy uses Discord‚•πhe does‚•πSee i am sad‚•πwhy‚•πRamesh doesn't even notice that he has 2 monitors now
Just that he uses Discord‚•πCause unlike yall my monitors r different sizes‚•πmine is too
one of mine is 15 inches‚•πmine were never different sizes
even when i didn't have that one
i used my laptop monitor
and it is 1080p‚•πMy laptop is 15, but my monitor is 27‚•πheck
even my phone‚•πIts annoying‚•πis 1080p
no those are inches‚•πIdk what i use it on‚•πits pixels that matter‚•πLaptop has fancy retina
Desktop has 1440p‚•πapple screens are weird resolutions‚•πIts downscaled
Its weird‚•πim still trying to wrap my head around the storming of the capital‚•πHmm yes‚•πits like
why tho‚•πIdk
What did they expect‚•πalso‚•πTrumps twitter got permanently banned
Yea‚•πyes
yes
this
is
great‚•πHold on hold on
Some people will beg to differ‚•πwhy‚•πwho
why‚•πanti - cancel culturists?‚•πhowever
i think that it better have been preserved
officially‚•πYea mabye‚•πwell‚•πik internet archive exists
or like‚•πit even loads the video‚•πshow the old tweets‚•πYea i think it would have been better like this‚•πafter 3 minutes‚•πbut prevent him from continuing to tweet‚•πfrom twitter's perspective
its like
no
we will not be a part of this‚•πBut there was a lot of other movements
Like BLM which was also bad
But they didnt ban accounts for it‚•πthe president of the united states
should not‚•πBtw this is great dont get me wrong‚•πbe using twitter
to spread
fake news‚•πThats what i hate‚•πand if i were twitter‚•πfn from_domain(domain: String) {
        
    }‚•πHeck even facebook banned him‚•πi dont understand‚•πignore this‚•πok‚•πonly for like
till the end of presidency right‚•πwhat i dont get is this‚•πi still wanna hear what the pope has to say on this‚•πI think‚•πwe have so many people in our country
half of them are republicans
conservatives
right-leaning
so why
become president
and not
one
of the many
sane
individuals‚•πCause he ran ig‚•πwho share similar views‚•πpeople
america‚•πHe was lucky‚•πis insane
idk
they thought he was ¬´different¬ª‚•πYea
Cause he was a so called‚•πi dont like democracy‚•πI think things will become better‚•πthe ppl are dumb
the ppl should only share
their ideals
and views
not
choose who the president is
and then the president in office
should be forced
to hold to those views‚•πHmmmmm‚•πthat way
we dont get ppl like trump
but also
issues that matter more to one side or the other
get handled‚•πWell things should be better now‚•πaccordingly‚•πCause Trump radicalized the right‚•πTrumpism‚•πOnce he gets out‚•πand another thing
how did masks
become partisan‚•πThe right/gop should become better‚•πhow the f
did masks
become partisan‚•πUmmm
Trump?‚•πour country is divided‚•πDidnt he downplay covid and not use a mask‚•πyes‚•πThen got covid‚•πyes‚•πThen started to use one‚•πmaybe
yknow in this country
there is no government figure to look up to
when we are unsure‚•πGenius‚•πhaha
wait‚•πIdk i like the speaker of the house
The old one‚•πPelosi?‚•πRyan i think it was‚•πidk i cant trust anyone there‚•πNah i have respect for him‚•πat that timestamp‚•πThat thumps up
Hes staring into my soul
QAnon‚•πwatch it
its so funny‚•πThat is a cult
Look it up
Its so stupid‚•πno
watch this‚•πLike wtf is this‚•πwhite ppl‚•πYup
Conservative white people
I aint gonna call all white people like this‚•πdid you see the video‚•πIm watching
With no audio tho‚•πits like a short clip
no its all the audio
its his comment
its so funny‚•πUgh fine
I mean he isnt wrong‚•π"you're not supposed to storm the capital unless you're prepared - at least wear some googles or some s"‚•πThat was good
Everyone was pissed at how they did it
Also did u know‚•πwhat‚•πThe lack of wearing masks during the raid actually was a detriment‚•πtbh‚•πEveryones faces could be caught on camera‚•πall we can hope for
is that those ppl
die
of covid‚•πIf they wore masks like they should have, the chances get reduced‚•πbc they dont wear masks‚•πHaha
Just wear a mask
How hard is it
The entire fcking world does it‚•π*sigh‚•πNot americans‚•πi could complain‚•πWe have guns‚•πwe will fight
the coronavirus
WITH GUNS‚•πFor our FREEDOM
This was the cure all along
Those damn liberals‚•πyes‚•πWe just needed our guns‚•π*sigh‚•πWelp
I can only hope bidens a decent prez‚•πthey wanna impeach him
my dad is like
flaming
he was saying curse words
with my brother nearby‚•πFlaming trump or the congress?‚•πat trump
like these are the words
he uses‚•πAh i think everyones parents were‚•πwhen he is under this thing in our garage
and he stands up
and whacks his head
real hard
its like‚•πAh‚•πcuz its too low‚•πPut a pillow
Itll soften the blow‚•πput a pillow on trump‚•πHe is a pillow‚•πno
you may not use that
until you convince me
not to be lazy
and actually
get the server running
on a stable system‚•πDo it
I mean if u want‚•πit takes like 10 minutes‚•πIts a tone indicator‚•πidk tone indicators‚•πIts like to protect urself from people on the internet‚•πwhat does it mean
ah‚•πI think‚•πwhy is this a thing
i literally have autism
and i get it‚•πSo
Essentially
People cant take jokes‚•πah‚•πSo they need to be told its a joke‚•π*shaking head‚•πSmh my head
Its the most commonly used one‚•πi dont talk on online forums‚•πI sometimes
Le reddit is a good place
Every problem one has
Its prob on reddit‚•πi should go to reddit
and see stuff
idk i just look at it from search results
when im like
why the fck my nginks aint werkin
hellllp me‚•πGoogle is a great place‚•πmake ma nginks work‚•πHave fun‚•πno it works
right now‚•πImma learn blockchain‚•πand i challenged ramesh
to figure out the cloudflare thing‚•πWhat cloudflare thing‚•πcuz hes so into linux
so essentially‚•πAlso can u not use cloudflare‚•πif you wanna ssl a wildcard‚•πIts harder to hack ur websites and stuff‚•πthen you have to use dns verification
and to automate that
there is a plugin
that will automatically update the .txt record in cloudflare‚•πHuh
I don‚Äôt understand any of this‚•πbut it wasnt working correctly
its simple
in order to ensure
that you own the domain
letsencrypt gives you a verification key
then
their servers
well
first
you put that key in your dns of your domain
then
their servers check for it
if it matches
they assume you own the domain for the next 90 days
before you have to re do this process‚•πHuh
Lets encrypt sounds nice
I should use it‚•πwell
only use it if you have to
otherwise
just use cloudflare
in flexible mode‚•πI use cloudflare now‚•πcloudflare also decreases the load on ur server
by 75%‚•πYea
I found our 1000 people have visited my website
In like 4 months‚•πim actually at 59%
for this month
caching‚•πMakes sense
U have way to many websites
U need professional help
Its not good‚•πi wike websites‚•πItll feel good the first few times
Then everything will only be about websites
Ur life will go downhil‚•πwhats nice about web is this‚•πStay in school‚•πeveryone
can get to it
its not like
i have to compile for ur platform
and force you to open the cli‚•πOkay well i make things i need‚•πalso web is just easy‚•πEh
It might be‚•πit makes sense‚•πI havent played with it enough‚•πits simple
and that's what ppl are gonna see
like
when i wanna show ppl what i have done
i show them my websites
this is not electro swing
this song was released today
at least on spotify
u prob dont/wont like it‚•πIll listen to it tmrw‚•πyknow a problem
all these qanon and white supremacists and whatever
they all look the same
and there are ppl who look like them
who are not qanon white supremacists
and so now there is implicit bias against these ppl
with good reason in most cases
but there are ppl like i said who are white with beards
and are not
white supremacists
i could name several teachers in our school
who look like those ppl
and now every time i see one of those white men with beards
i instinctively am reminded of this‚•πinteresting‚•πhow is this a thing
you responded
but did not read my last message
oh
migod
i need
an article
from the recent
storming of the capital
not from 1939‚•πcapitol‚•πi was like
is this guy one of the rioters
and then i was like
no
hes wearing a mask‚•πHa‚•πi am now doing the French thing
ik you asked me about it 5 hrs ago‚•πOui oui baguette
d√©go√ªtant ne faire pas tes devoirs? smhhhhh‚•πwhat is smh‚•πikn‚•πwhat is ikn‚•π¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
>_<‚•πwhat is ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø‚•πpassive-aggressive shrugging
shaking my head‚•πRepl
uses
google docs however
does not
replit and internet explorer make a great team
what is it with my phone and always being at 69 percent
when i look at it‚•πDebate and Michael getting no sleep also makes a great team‚•πyes
hence
why you are awake
to see cy's addiction to web design
that keeps him up
at this hour
im streaming gyro data from a phone
to a 3d representation‚•πI want to do web design so badly
Oooo‚•πon another computer‚•πThat is cool‚•πusing websockets
it is cool‚•πI've wanted to do that with acclormotor‚•πeven my dad said so‚•πLike external one‚•πi wanna do it with phone
the idea is‚•πAnd model rocket flights‚•πyou use your phone
as essentially
a wii remote
for something on ur pc
like a web game‚•πBruhhh‚•πor presentation
or‚•πPing pong‚•πyeah
something like that
actually that's a good idea
i might implement that‚•πYuh‚•πbut for now i need my spinney rectangle
which i dont have‚•πAwww‚•πcuz i need to add client registration
to my server
before i can do that
repl uses websockets‚•πIma go to bed cuz I finish debate work for tommrow
Bye‚•πbye‚•πah yes
who wants a silicon child‚•π"iphones are for leftist communist liberals"
we are americans
we buy samsung
we support america
by being domestic terrorists
*sigh
notice though
the categories of android people
its on YouTube now‚•πwhat did I do wrong‚•πi have literally no clue‚•πit was like
a joke
using
a book quote
that no one will get
Are you sick and tired of Nitro subs flexing on you?
Ha ha
what do you think though‚•πum
i mean
sure gimme an api key‚•πokay
ill make one‚•πk
um
now what‚•πyou um
then once you have cargo
run‚•πk‚•πidk if it works on windows
im like
99% sure it works
wait
uhm nah it works‚•πum
make it werk‚•πYes
enter
Then it will ask for your api key
now do
emotes help
you should probably make a namespace
like emotes namespace create slug "Name of Namespace"
the slug is what you will use to access
so like
what
did you run
I love how you don't show the command
yes
that's not
how it works
it's
emotes namespace help‚•πhi my name is cy
i do not use‚•πYou‚•πcli tools‚•πneed
to
emotes namespace create cy "Cy's Namespace"‚•πum‚•πI don't rtfm‚•πk now
how
do i upload‚•πemotes emotes upload <namespace_slug> <emote_slug> emote_path
so like
emotes emotes upload cy <emote_slug> <emote_path>‚•πhmm
also
plz
make
ur messages
mono
so i can copy them‚•πwdym mono‚•πwith one click
like‚•πok
fine
ik
did you upload anything
ah‚•πhi you know whats a thing‚•πyou know what is a thing
this is a thing
sigh‚•πhey ramesh
can you go
to
on your phone
then click
make it work
yes
now
leave that open
and open
on your pc‚•πok cool
it is like
off‚•πoh‚•πthat might be
a compass issue
idk‚•πit start 90 deg off
which browser did you use
on the phone‚•πfirefox‚•πyeah
so
i think
firefox and Samsung internet
start at 90 deg
whereas safari and chrome
start at 0
if you wanna fix it
just like
turn your phone‚•πi will‚•π90 deg to the left
counter clockwise
then
reload the page
and click the button
then turn it right side up‚•πlater‚•πwhat should i do with this‚•πGame
controller‚•πyes that's what i was thinking
wii
ima make another website
hi my name is cy
wait
before i make this website
lemme see if someone already made it
meh
it exists
but only kinda
so its a YouTube player syncer
so essentially
ppl can watch all at once
and share
the same stream
so for example
instead of teachers streaming YouTube over zoom
they use this
so they can pause
change the time in the video
and
chat
using embedded nochat
all on one page
that syncs
to all other viewers‚•πsorry
Cy
But HOW IS THIS CURSE WORDS
Like in caps
oh
Ah
You mean the users‚•πcan you send me the link‚•πsee‚•πyes
um‚•πI see
one‚•πi
cannot‚•πcurse word‚•πtalk
no more
about this
with my parents‚•πI understand‚•πjust‚•πI'm just saying like‚•πdo not‚•πI won't‚•πsend
anything
remotely
innapropriate
ever‚•πSee‚•πagain‚•πI did not
look at the
user list‚•πlike for safety
just dont link to other discord servers‚•πOkay then‚•πi see‚•πFPS: 0.17
this
is the problem
This is probably a remarkable piece of technology though
I'm not going to play it
but interesting‚•πi see
*yawn
i wanna go to sleap‚•π*yann
sleap then‚•πsleap
i wanna
but
i have
2 ours‚•πdo it then‚•πof ohmwork
cy has dimmed the lights
now he feels awaek
eye spel‚•πFinally
MS edge has vertical tabs on linux
Ramesh has surviviorship bias from Linux‚•πso i did an experiment
and i actually asked one of the teachers
for a web app idea
i asked Mr Y
and he told me
he wants an app
that can give him tracking data
on who when and how people watched/listened to his videos and audio‚•πlike audio of the students‚•πno‚•πor if they had audio on‚•πPlayposit‚•πhe makes videos
i told him‚•πthat‚•πhe said he has already started looking at it
but
but idrk
he sort of
dismissed it
in my conversation
he also told me this:
he told me‚•πu should make an app that pairs with a small tile in ur pocket that sends tracking info to him‚•πsoftware for school has to be approved
by ppl‚•πOf course
By the board‚•πits useful for debate‚•πwhy
xplane‚•πdeb8‚•πCause those buildings big‚•πcuz track city‚•πwhy tho‚•πcuz he need track us wen in big city‚•πAnd u get lost in them hella easily‚•πthis is an actual issue?‚•πyea
cuz all of our rounds are miles apart‚•πberry
num
num‚•πyesssssssssssssss‚•πReally?‚•πberry num nums for all‚•πberry num nums are like $150‚•πyea, in some cases like at upen‚•πthey xpensive‚•πAh‚•πyea but‚•πI wanted to do debate
But im bad at it‚•πnoooo‚•πAnd am lazy‚•πwait‚•πu be goo‚•πLoRa‚•πtrust me
lora
dumb
for this
bc‚•πIll try next year‚•πwhat if i made an app tho‚•πok‚•πfor fone‚•πyeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa‚•πthat did trak‚•πu hav experience from berrynumnum‚•πalternatively tho‚•πbut the problem is
apple‚•πyou could just like‚•πYup‚•πall have a telegram group
and share live location‚•πthat murder battery tho‚•πtrue
but hardware is hard
literally‚•πlike send location at certon tics‚•πhard-ware‚•πlike if u on the move it track live‚•πU might as well just give tiles to students‚•πwhat if i could reprogram those gps dog trackers‚•πwait‚•πwith cellular‚•πi just found something‚•πwhat
yeah but
those dont have GPS
so
they are like
weird
they like‚•πyea but they are good enough for a city‚•πlog where you last lost them
so like
if you walk away from them
go like more than 50 ft‚•πlike they have a 5 mile raidus and other ppl with the tile app make mesh‚•πthey lose signal‚•πand relay info‚•πand log
hold on‚•πtile is big mesh network‚•πyeah but its not reliable‚•πbut it cheeeepppppppppp‚•πits mostly for finding lost things
that's cuz no gps
or cellular‚•πyuh‚•πLost kids‚•πthey are expendable‚•πno
thats what the police for
the thing is you could just solve that with telegram live locations
they dont hurt battery life that much‚•πyuh‚•πdid you hear
no one wants whatsapp
cuz facebook‚•πYup
Mandatory data collection‚•πthey all gonna use signal or telegram
PWA ftw
ah eyeohesse‚•πHuh he has 30%‚•πyou mean
telegram
has 30% of ppl‚•π?‚•π?
im lost‚•πno i mean the commision
he has a 30% commision rate‚•πwhat does that mean‚•πthat means any money he makes
30% goes to apple‚•πah‚•πfrom the app ofc‚•πyes
eyeohesse
eyeohesse is wonderful‚•πyes‚•πeyeohyesse
ima make mr y's app
that tracks video watch time
although
idk exactly how imma do it
probably with a flask app
also
since this is more relevant
I should learn
DBs‚•πyes
i recommend Mongo
but u can learn any‚•π"just store it all in a json"
how do dbs work‚•πtsk tsk tsk
this‚•πxplain‚•πlike an excel sheet
but bigger
better‚•πi make
big
xcel sheets‚•πwell no
excel is for like one-2 people‚•πwell what i hear
is that
dbs‚•πDB are more focused on lots of data‚•πallow for simultaneous access‚•πlike thousands
and yea simultaneous access and its easier to filter‚•πi see
so if i wanted to use mongo
for example
how would i do that
like
specifically
like what do you do‚•πidk specifically
im learning how to use em rn‚•πhave you used dbs
i see‚•πlike a few times
but with example code‚•πi see
ok
tbh i might start with mysql‚•πthat also works‚•πsince its more popular
LAMP‚•πyea
im just learning mongo cause ive used it before‚•πbtw
the person who started mongo
i saw a presentation
by her
they started it
by asking lotsa ppl
what are you upset with
and they said oracle
i dont wanna pay oracle
thousands of dollers
or use krap
i want
good software
idk exactly her part
but ik she knows about how it came about‚•πyea mongo is nice
my dads work uses mongo
is there any way to get all my telegram messages‚•πwdym
yes
there is‚•πhow?‚•πhence‚•πyes but how‚•πone moment‚•πwait do i need telegram desktop
like the actual desktop app‚•πi rekord my skrean‚•πyes‚•πeye spel‚•πcy did you try emotes
moar‚•πum
what do you want me to do‚•πi thawt cy yousehs dƒ±skawd‚•πcy doesn't emote tho‚•π:(‚•πand he doesn't like discord
for regular chat‚•πoh
is it bwoken now
no
eye cant spwel‚•πyes‚•π200%
not üíØ
:200:‚•πramesh
what is the server written in
rust
?‚•π?
Python‚•πthe server
oh python
flask?‚•πjawmes contwibutwed‚•πyou should
um
make the things subdomains
so like‚•πum
that might be not easy‚•πidk how u wrote ur app
but
i did it‚•πok fine maybe‚•πmyself‚•πyes
seems easy
also make an issue in the emotes repository‚•πlike
i have a flask server
that does this‚•πno ik i can see
this‚•πwhy
for what‚•πill forget
literally
say‚•πah‚•π"make namespaces accessible via subdomains"‚•πk
what is wsgi‚•πidk some like
protocol
for like making web servers‚•πi see‚•πim making a function called disconnect
and i randomly
randomly
heard the windows xp disconnect sound‚•πAh
This is very ironic
How convenient‚•πSigh
Yes
Now we are forced to put this into discord
see
ramesh doesn't care much for "data science"‚•πMake a rust thing to do it for u
Data science is cool‚•πI think shile ding
is pronounced shr luh ding‚•πum
so i guess i learned mongo‚•πsignal
does not horrible
anymore‚•πdoes not horrible‚•πdoes not horrible‚•πdoes not
horrible
that is correct
also elon recommended it
which is funny‚•πtime to install it‚•πhaha what is elon doing
that requires signal‚•πwhy doesnt he just buy signal‚•πikr‚•πlike its pocket change for him
why is signal blowing up all of a sudden?
ah
well we stickin with telegram or moving to signal?
good‚•πi like
not having
to use an electron app‚•πsignal is slow
i just sent Ramesh a message‚•πno it's not
no deleting cy‚•πthere
i have
one
contact
what is this
no i dont like signal
we use tewegwam‚•πim just seeing
im not gonna actually use it‚•πi just saw‚•πi must see too‚•πyes‚•πcygh‚•πthe magnificent crown
ah france‚•πMy house rn‚•πah
constructoin
we had that
for a year
i say no to AWS‚•πwhy u making a cluster?‚•πtbh idk why they even let you choose
just like
gimme the best one
idk cuz thats what you do
they host 500MB of databases for free‚•πoh nice
i would just host locally‚•πi mean i would too
but like
frankly
if i could get the whole thing hosted in the cloud
for free
that would be nice
like
use cloudflare pages for the static stuff
pythonanywhere for the backend
and mongo atlas for the db
freenom for the domain
a whole web app
all free
it would require putting a lot of the code client-side
since i refuse for the domain of my app
so like
js in the page
would have to load everything
and read all the pathargs
and everything
and then fetch the content from the server
and the db
which is not what i was intending
i was intending
for a flask server
to just do it all‚•πramesh is
typing from nomachine
in another room
and can switch between monitors‚•πwhat is nomachine again‚•πremote desktop‚•πah‚•πramesh is downloading roms with JDownloader‚•πroms
yay‚•πroms
for what‚•πMy brother
to enable him
to play games‚•πk
hi im using MongoDB‚•πhi im using postgres
imma use postgres from now onwards
bye bye mysql‚•πhi idk what that is
readybeluga
readybeluga
uses
a
json
file‚•π‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚•πthe thing is‚•πi thought for ready u atleast used a db‚•πno
to be fair
the json file works
you didn't notice
but
the json file needs to go
that being said
it has to be fast
so
um
i cant really afford to be asking mongodb for data every time
or can i?
idk how this works‚•πwdym?
its the same as what u r doing with a json‚•πi have to go the cloud
i have to place requests
with readybeluga
i just
have a dictionary
in ram
and i store it to json
for non-volatility‚•πidk i think itll be the same speed
it might be slower by a bit‚•πmeh for now ill leave readybeluga as-is
its just for like
my project for the YouTube thing
will not use a json
it will use
like
mongoDB
idk if i told u
i have never
ever
used a db before‚•πYes
good progress bar‚•πi need animation ideas people
something simple
but intresting‚•πum
windows xp screensaver‚•πNo it has to have a story
i wanted to do that‚•πthat has a story‚•πbut its way to easy
?‚•πum‚•πim curios‚•πRamesh's story‚•πcontinue‚•πno i will not continue‚•πdang
any other ideas‚•πthis‚•πthings I could animate
which one?‚•πred is blue‚•πthats a bit to hard‚•πidk im not good at ideas‚•πI could animate it
its just that the animation would be very bad
I was thinking I could make a Henry Stickman animation
cause i can copy his character models
but add a twist‚•πthen do that
idk what that is‚•πsome of the best flash games ever‚•πIt's sad cuz flash go bye bye‚•πso you can reload

I get a month‚•πim telling you‚•πAnd a half sometimes‚•πfactory charge matters
factory charge
is not good‚•πAlways charge to 100%
Whenever u get something‚•πyeah i didn't charge it at all
i like
turned it on
and used it‚•πU should expect like a month with constant use
A year and a half idle‚•πk‚•πDont ask how ik this‚•πi should charge it‚•πDo it‚•πunlike the appow maus‚•πLuckily urs has usb c‚•πyou can
like
charge it
and use it‚•πIk‚•πat the same time‚•πI do it sometimes
Ill just usually let it sit and charge‚•πi have a usb pd charger at my desk
which i use for everything
like my laptop charger
which i use for fone

even the pi‚•πI need to start switching to usb c
Lots of my things vary heavily
Ooo they made the charger look nicer‚•πINSERTION
no thats not the one in the box

hell no
gtfo
and now i doubt anyone will want to host them‚•πNope‚•πsolution:
dont be an anti-Semite‚•πIts also the easiest solution‚•πwell you'd be surprised
what it takes
to convince ppl
maybe having their service shut down by amazon will convince them‚•πWell they sued‚•πhow are they supposed to get anything from suing amazon
who‚•πSo it might take more‚•πin their right mind‚•πIdk‚•πwould sue amazon‚•πApparently its a breach in contract or something‚•πactually theres one other solution for parler‚•πThey aint gonna get anything tho‚•πtechmikeny
but even at that‚•πHaha‚•πwith the publicity
they have gotten
and because
this
is on their Wikipedia page
no one‚•πThey dont really have a chance to get back‚•πi doubt even hardware providers‚•πAmazon has a nice legal team‚•πa nice one‚•πVery nice one‚•πyes
i mean
maybe
some like

which i giv to teacher
playtools will be based on a YouTube frame

what it will do
is report metrics

a samsung‚•πI want to‚•πfor your first android‚•πSo bad‚•πyou will hate android‚•π2nd‚•πand wish that you bought an iphone‚•π2nd android‚•πi tutchd the pixel in store‚•π1st android after being a fanboi‚•πit was nice
but‚•πThere u go‚•πwhat else did you tutch‚•πIs smooooth‚•πit only as 128gb‚•πÂèØÁà±ÁöÑÂ•≥Ôºü‚•πThats double what i have‚•πand that is not enough
for m
e‚•πi have 128
seems fine‚•πIdk i thinks its enough‚•πi have 128
+ an SD card‚•πKinda sad they no longer have free google photos
But eh‚•πmy 128gb is 98% full
and my 128gb sd card is 75% full
i need storidge
and google doesn't giv it to me
porridge storridge‚•πah yes

to copy spotlight‚•πno this is the powertoys thing
i still like my non-spotlight search‚•πthese are the kinds of things we are learning in spanish class‚•πi dont wanna be sentenced to 640 years in prison‚•πthen dont steal babies
simple‚•πmy mom wants to spend $30K on a lab computer‚•πyes‚•πI want to spend 30k
on
ok nvm‚•πsee what im trying to understand‚•πcan it run crysis?‚•πis
like‚•πnice one‚•πshould she just use like Google Cloud‚•πidk‚•πNo‚•πthey r special i think‚•πwhy‚•πPhysical > Cloud‚•πwhy‚•πBecause
you
own
the
hardware‚•π^‚•πbut its $30k‚•πso‚•πgoogle cloud would be cheaper
since this is not like a server‚•πhow much‚•πbut its a lab computer‚•πwhich has to run all the time‚•πyes
then
just buy a server‚•πso you can stop it‚•πit is easier to set up anyway‚•πand not pay
so like if you only need it for 10 hours a week‚•πok fine but that's boring
just find out
which costs less as a whole
for however long
and then choose that if you wanna be practical
personally I would get the server though‚•πthe thing is the purchased one i think they said would be 4 years
before obselete
tbh
idrk what they are doing
cuz they also have a cluster
they have like Rutgers cluster computing services
so you can get essentially google cloud
but on premises
at rutgers‚•πooh
ok i like that‚•πthe main issue she is having
is she wants money
and they want to know
to the dollar
how much money she will need
next year
so like
you tell me‚•πi mean‚•πhow much the dollar will decrease in value next year‚•πuh‚•πand how much that will change the price of a $300k microscope‚•πid say a whole 10 cents‚•πit is not really a bad song‚•πthats why u always add extra money
u add emergency funds‚•πima eat dinner
bye‚•πcya‚•πima record my spanish video‚•πah thats always a pain

i like pain
yes
i dunno i mean if i were a well meaning republican
i would not want
this person
anywhere near me
hes bad for the party
its like‚•πyeah
even
mitch
might consider impeachment
and thinks what trump did is impeachable‚•πi dont advocate for terrible electron ui's being used as default programs in windows
even though i like windows‚•πbtw telegram uses more ram than discord
just saying
Ah
Prekalk‚•πno‚•πno i already did the practice‚•πjeohmeatree‚•πno discord uses more ram than unigram
"Akash M" is taking up 12mb of ram
how dare he‚•πthis is
I have to add
so maybe nvm
I saw telegram at like
800 mb
at some point‚•πtelegram takes up more‚•πYea
but telegram‚•πon telegram
i can send videos‚•πyes
look i dont like discord‚•πon discord‚•πim just sayin‚•πi cannot
if im downstairs‚•πis a long list‚•πworking with servers
and i need to send a video
to someone
im not gonna go and like
record
then upload to doggo
and get it all working‚•πit takes like‚•πall on my phone
and then
send it‚•πnot long‚•πdoggo takes like 5 seconds‚•πok but i have to log in
in the web portal
then go through the crap android file selector‚•πjust log in once‚•πon my phone‚•πOh‚•πwhen i take a video‚•πShare via KDE connect‚•πits on my phone‚•πsend‚•π*sigh‚•πhow did u get it in the thingy?
do i have to build as executable?‚•πwdym
that's woof2
not howl‚•πdoggo is faster than telegram
that's for sure‚•πThis is how
note the doggoninja.desktop‚•πAh i see
I have to figure out how to get it on le mac‚•πor

lol
this is pointless‚•πwhat is this‚•πriveting‚•πis pence gonna do it?‚•πNope
besides I'm not sure if a 25th is good‚•πi mean i dont see how he would‚•πwe want to prevent mister trump from holding office again
which means
im peach‚•πbut 25th amendment doesn't do that
you need to convict
and remove
and decide
not to let him go again
which is unlikely to happen‚•πyes

i was like
china
and my group members were like
no
you can leave‚•πI hav debate prep on that‚•πwere not gonna talk about china
they like
kill ppl
regularly‚•πshould we ban tiktok then‚•πno
we should
give tiktok
to a us company
i support that‚•πwhat about
keeping it
like it is‚•πno‚•πand unbanning huawei‚•πchina
is
a threat
to the us‚•πso‚•πand its citizens‚•πfree market
economy
is a thing‚•πso is privacy and data laws
ppl dont care about their data rn‚•πso is the CIA asking Microsoft for yer data‚•πbut once they do‚•πthey will realize that US companies‚•πthey will not want it in china‚•πare a bigger threat
to the average citizen of the US
than chinese companies‚•πlisten
would you rather have china have a record of the lives of americans
by name
or the US
where we have laws
and the people can say
what happens to their data‚•πwhat are they going to benefit from
having
a list
of
americans
and their lives
look
Chinese law does not apply to the US‚•πreal time info on anyone they want to attack‚•πChina cannot walk into your house and steal yer stuff
Yes but as an average citizen
am I gonna get attacked‚•πhighly valueable user data
that they could use against us
by tracking us
control over our elections
through use of their platform‚•πcool‚•πto promote
their ideas‚•πthen don't be stupid
I really fail to see
how‚•πand spread conspiracies‚•πusing a
huawei phone
will spread conspiracies
if I am not using‚•πthis is tiktok we're talking about‚•πchinese software
well
please provide evidence they are doing that
And I will believe you‚•πHuawei just needs to stop because they steal
my dad tells me all the time
he tells me
how the chinese
steal
wholesale
everything
all our IP
they steal it
and they oughta pay‚•πit's a tricky issue‚•πmy dad is the most anti-trump person
except
when it comes to china‚•πI mean
Biden is also a china hardliner‚•πhe supports trump
when it comes to china‚•πthis is like
a bipartisan thing now
you know‚•πi mean
that's my stance
regardless of the partisanness
Chinese software cannot be a thing in the US
until china follows data rules
and it is clear to consumers what china might do to their data
and china should not be able to sell cutting-edge hardware‚•πah‚•πbecause its all stolen
from us‚•πis it all‚•πand from others
most of it‚•πif it were stolen why has germany‚•πis stolen‚•πnot banned china‚•πbecause germany
is not the one
making 5G
they are not the leaders in telecom
or silicon‚•πshrug‚•πi have watched videos
where startups
talk about
how
they made something
and then
the chinese
came
and stole it‚•πand then?‚•πand they were done
no one bought their thing‚•πgive an example‚•πthere are two examples
i dont remember them clearly
but
one was this light up book lamp
or something
and the other was some sort of cylindrical thing
i literally dont remember anything else
about it
but i think about making a startup
and if i do
i dont want china stealing my ip‚•πthen
start your company in china‚•πhell no‚•πwhy not‚•πim not giving my data to the Chinese government‚•πand why‚•πand risking my employees being killed
by the government
secretly‚•πhow much
does that happen‚•πif i dont do what they say‚•πPlease give examples
I am uninformed
Of such nasty things‚•πno one knows
all they know
is that
china
kills people
with no reason
other than that they dont like them‚•πother countries have a tendency to do that too
why dont we just ban them all‚•πchina is notorious
google does not exist in china‚•πso
baidu barely exists in the US
huawei is banned in the US‚•πbecause they chose not to give their data to the government
bing
went the other way‚•πwell
the way you could see it is‚•πthe Chinese are forcing apple
to put their icloud servers‚•πthey are complying with regulations‚•πin china
for Chinese users
and we‚•πyou really think‚•πshould be forcing‚•πchina would be powerful‚•πchinese companies‚•πif they were less protectionist‚•πto put their data
in the US‚•πjapan was rather protectionist too to boost their economy‚•πchina
needs
to play
by the rules‚•πillegal
immigrants
need
to play
by the rules‚•πwdym‚•πand not cross the border illegally
they should
wait
in line‚•πlook im not informed on illegal immigrants
so i dont really have a stance
but
when it comes to china
and trade‚•πlook I don't really think that china needs to have such a hardline stance
censuring and sanctioning china is going to punish normal citizens
who dont really care about geopolitics
and rather care about advancing their own lives‚•πno‚•πi am not talking about people
who steal ip
because
im sure it exists‚•πthe government in china
is the problem
china steals what we have
and sells it back
to our mindless consumers
this is not a fair trade
and it needs to stop‚•πso plenty of companies do that in the US too‚•πin the us we have regulation‚•πHa
tell that to Google and Apple‚•πin the US we consider amazon "a problem"‚•πAnd Microsoft
and Amazon‚•πbecause they are like
anti-competitive or something‚•πThey are‚•πimagine amazon just unlocked all the data in all their servers
and read it all
and made their own version
of everything
for half price‚•πIt's not as if china is doing nothing about this
let me provide an example‚•πbecause they employ underpaid workers‚•πAh well
I heard a case
where china like
ruled that car companies were copying too much
and like did something about it
so did the US when it was industrializing‚•πwhen it was industrializing
we have moved past that now‚•πit was corrupt
and bad
and people were mistreated
and big companies abused their power‚•πyes
that's right‚•πnow compare
china
to industrializing us‚•πbut guess what
we have grown up
and we dont do that anymore
and china‚•πwe don't‚•πoughta grow up‚•πsanctions
are dumb
have they ever
ever been effective‚•πit doesn't matter if they're effective
the reality is
American data
is ending up in china
and
american technology
is being stolen by china‚•πthus we ban huawei
so if anyone works for huawei here
they can go to hell
and get fired‚•πmy dad's company sells to huawei
they are one of the main customers
but even with that
look at his stance‚•πThat is his stance‚•πhis stance
is anti-china‚•πLook
Idk‚•πtbh what we need to do
is inform americans
that using tiktok results
in all their data
being in china‚•πI now stand in the 0% of americans who think our foreign policy is too harsh‚•πand then inform them
what china does‚•πdoes it though
is it stored in china‚•πyes
it is‚•πshow me
please
i forgot‚•πbut even if its not‚•πi want to see where it says that‚•πthe chinese
still have full access to it
the government
so if the people
we the people
wanna keep our tiktok
force the chinese to sell it to a US company‚•πlook
im tired
of talking about this‚•πk‚•πill just‚•πill stop‚•πgo somewhere else
where
geopolitics is not important‚•πnull island‚•πand the country doesn't set interntational precedents
i like
neutrality‚•πyes i do too‚•πi do not
want
to take a stance
on anything like this
even if it's good or bad‚•πi take stances
or i dont
it depends
its just that like
i might wanna make a startup company
and i dont want my company crushed
by the chinese‚•πyes uhm‚•πi dont wanna have to know what that feels like‚•πyou should
look at the ratio
of
crushed startups
to non crushed startups‚•πhardware startups
ima watch that debate

Why is there a Republican representative who is Russian‚•πAmerica‚•πDuring an impeachment proceeding, a Democrat from Wisconsin says
"Let's unite and get 2000 dollar stimulus checks to everyone. Let's unite and solve this pandemic. "

I'm sure these are issues, but I'm also sure that they're not exactly relevant to the impeachment proceedings.
Cy is typing‚•πid1 is recognized
id1 reserves
id1 yields to id2‚•πThe gentleman from Ohio is recognized.‚•πid2 reserves‚•π"Mr. Speaker, I reserve."‚•πid2 is recognized‚•πReserve is actually smart though

i need 2 more things
i need things‚•πi dont understand exactly what you need‚•πmessgaes
i essentially need themes
add a feature where u can see which ones u have seen before
make it like achievements‚•πso like
ppl are inclined
to click more‚•πto keep refreshing
and add slight odds‚•πhow do i store who they are tho‚•πDB‚•πno like
srry
identify
who they are‚•πehh use a cookie‚•πbut then they can lose their progress‚•πi think thats fine
no ones gonna play this hardcore
make the cookie expire in like 3 years‚•πwell it would be localstorage
which i think is different from cookies‚•πidk much bout cookies‚•πi could add some js to the site and just make it have a number in the bottom
in really light grey‚•πThat would work‚•π9 repubs‚•πAnd they can get their progress with that code‚•πmy my‚•πYes
We r getting somewhere
Whats the vote
I stopped watching‚•πImpeached
passed‚•πNice‚•πdone
added
i find it funny that it runs faster
over the internet
than to my local machine
idk why that is‚•π1/10 of the way there
2/10 of the way there‚•π5 trillion em‚•π3/10
ah yes‚•πwdym
5 trillion em‚•πgigantic font‚•πah‚•π1/2 way there
ah cy
did i break it‚•πno
i just restarted it‚•πWhy‚•πto make it even lighter
it was too dark‚•πIm gonna lose this progress‚•πno‚•πi didnt
lets goi‚•πits called localstorage for a reason‚•πim in a incognito so i thought it would vanish‚•πit will
if you close
and reopen
the camera literally just dies like 2/3 way through
hi my name is cy
i hit refresh‚•πhow many times tho
pleb
refreshed 1000 times
my finger is dying
but its worth it
1/10th of the way to the goal
My wifis bad
It takes like 2 seconds to refresh‚•πuse chrome‚•π?????‚•πit does better caching‚•πIn a minute‚•πmine refreshes literally instantly‚•πAll my progress will be gone‚•πtrue
unless you cheat‚•πlemme try edge‚•πand use dev tools‚•πthat should work
No cheating here
nope its still slow
welp im not gonna try
my fingers r dead‚•πliterally
over the internet
now if you would excuse me
i have to advertise a textbook
as a resistance implement
for PE‚•πah i am as well
idk how‚•πjust like
literally
it doenst matter
ima go do mine bye
my video is funny
i would send it
but‚•πcy how do u do google live translate
u know for videos
that dont have subtitles‚•πum
live transcribe?
or live translate‚•πsure‚•πi mean‚•πYall going back to school 3rd mp?‚•πIm in school tmrw
How about you‚•πIdk
Im prob gonna stay home‚•πK‚•πCause lifes easier‚•πI'ma eat dinner‚•πAnd i can le cheat on all tests
Have fun‚•πplease make a record‚•πCy its an addiction
I did
Like H or smthing‚•πah yes‚•πGet help‚•πthis is a test of the functionality of mongoDB‚•πI beg u
This is going too far‚•πwhy‚•πU have way to many websites
Downsize
U dont need this many‚•πmore is more‚•πBut less is more‚•πthis is about half‚•πOh god‚•πso simply put
it works‚•πNice
But its only 500mb‚•πok but like
1.
i can make more than one db
for free
and 2
i dont need that much‚•πHow much did this take up?‚•πfor like
wdym
it takes up as much as you put in‚•πYea how much have u used‚•πso right now probably like <1 kb‚•πNot bad‚•πwell cuz the only thing it has
is lorem‚•πStill
It should store a decent bit
I wanna have a rpi tracking the weather
And have it store everything in db‚•πactually nvm
more like 39KB
but most of that's probably overhead
like per-db overhead
not per-record‚•πHuh
I should learn blockchain as well‚•πthis atlas thing is almost a dream come true
completely free
forever
and it has all i need‚•πYea
Imma use my server tho‚•πand its reliable‚•πCause why not‚•πreliability
is why not
i wanna make reliable stuff
so i need a reliable db‚•πI prefer physical
Cause i can do whatever u want with it‚•πyes
but i see it this way
if the free‚•πLike give it more storage or ram‚•πalmost 100% reliable
offsite option
works
then
its better
although i will likely set up some onsite db for other things
like actual data storage‚•πyup
servers r nice‚•πlike for example
my dad
wants a log
of everything
in his lab
at work
starting with temp and humidity
to light levels
and the state of instruments
to the temperature in freezers
he wants it all
and i might set that up at some point
at which point i would need somewhere to store the data
and that could add up fast‚•πyea once u start doing that u need storage
thats gonna take up real fast‚•πbut for something like PlayTools
i really only need a db to store like
session ids
video ids
user ids
and user logs
that's it
and judging by how many ppl actually use my services
there wont be much of that
but
if i want teacher to use it
it has to be reliable
and not fail
unlike kami
which gives us
extra days
to study for tests‚•πthats good tho‚•πima show my db thing to my dad
wait
yeah ok it sorta works on mobile‚•πI wanna know
Is there anyway i can have a credit card run a command
Or some sort of card
Run a command‚•πum
wdym
on your laptop?
how is your laptop supposed to read a card‚•πNo no
Im trying to make a general use ledger system‚•πum
hang tight a moment
ill be right back‚•πBut i need some way to take credit/debit transactions
Off the card and into the db/blockchain/wherever the heck i store it
I may have to just use any card provided api/FDX api
But thats not as secure as id want it to be‚•πso wait
hold on
you wanna
use
actual money?
or you wanna use these as your credit cards‚•π'Murica‚•πramesh‚•πHej
je suis ici
tu peux me questionner maintainent
ou demander
i broke it‚•πdid you?‚•πtry /. and anything as the write value‚•πyeah
hi my name is cy
i know how to use good practices‚•πare you using
mongoose
or like an ORM‚•πno
idk what that is‚•πor like raw queries‚•πraw queries‚•πk
i cant
inject
also mongodb bad
please dont become a MERN dev‚•πwhat is MERN‚•πGewgle‚•πwhat are these
what is express‚•πYou will eventually find out
and fall into a trap‚•πwhat is it‚•πAnyhow I really need to capture an emotion from almost 12 hours ago
and it is fading
which is highly problematic‚•πum‚•πI'll just take out my emotion capture net and do it
catch it
Uhm‚•πyeah that stack is interesting
it seems more modern than say

what do you use‚•πMySQL
I actually used MongoDB once
I just don't like it since I'm crazy
SSPL‚•πwhat is better about mySQL‚•πthey said it was bad
Mongodb is complex
mysql is complex
couchdb is good
I like couchdb for noSQL‚•πI see
mongodb gave me free cloud hosting‚•πpeople are interesting as well‚•πwhat was that credit card thing‚•πi got a credit card for stuff online‚•πakhil wants to make like
his own currency
and digital banking system
and digital payments‚•πyes
this is the answer
Tried this once
I got lazy
maybe not on akhil's scale though
and I wrote like 1 line of code
but I had the idea
I think JP also tried it
I was just thinking
What is the cost of getting a girlfriend
Since girls like to ask for your time
In return for their attention to you‚•πit depends your job‚•πSince time costs money‚Ä¶
What is the cost of "getting" a girlfriend?‚•πGET http://girlfriend
since you are not secure
its http‚•πHA
funny‚•πcy now understands DBs‚•πRamesh now understands mutexes‚•πwhat is a mutex‚•πNot telling you
Although I definitely know
I know what it is ok
it's
a lock on a piece of data
for a thread to use
so that threads dont modify data at the same time‚•πi see‚•πWhat no‚•πso explain
so you want
physical credit cards‚•πIts to track the flow of real money
Its essentially an automated form of ledging and checkbook balancing for businesses/people‚•πhi i dont do money‚•πFor know at least
I may integrate a crypto whenever I understand it enough‚•πsorry im lost
what are you asking me
at a low level‚•πCan i has credit card somehow track how much it spent‚•πwith a db‚•πBut i already found out the answer
Which is no‚•πwdym‚•πCause findata is hella secure‚•πwhat is findata‚•πFinancial data‚•πyou want to read
from actual ppls credit cards‚•πYup‚•πhow much they have spent
ah i see
yeah no‚•πWell ideally not just their cards
But the entire account
So no‚•πi see‚•πSo i gotta use the FDX api
Or the card issuers api
Which makes this annoying‚•πi see‚•π"Strive to be a better you!"
Just like make it a fake card
that works within your network‚•πwhy dont setcharat work
this is big sad‚•πi should switch to light theme
just to annoy ppl‚•πyes
I use it
since I like it‚•πi like it
but its too bright
like when im staring at something for long enough
i prefer it to be dark
likely honors‚•πhmm alright‚•πwhy‚•πcause my english teacher was asking what we want to be recomended for‚•πur in cp tho‚•πyea
i have A+ average rn
so i can go to honors, or AP‚•πdoes that mean you can do AP?
hmm
idk tbh English and history are too tedius to do at an AP level
theyre not like more conceptual things like CS or Seminar/Research‚•πthen ill prob tell her honors
i gotta just keep my A
*knock on wood*‚•πi think i have a B+ in honors rn‚•πthats not to bad‚•πso i cant do AP i think even if  i wanted to‚•πi have a B+ in chem‚•πi have an A in chem‚•πYes
what is this?‚•πAkhil I am in the same boat as u, I think ima do honors
not ap‚•πyea sounds better‚•πalso, you would have more time for other ap courses
also r u doin ap calc next year
cuz u do cp precalc right‚•πyea
i dont think i can jump
idk i gotta ask‚•πAP English sucks‚•πIs it worth doing‚•πProbably
For you
personally I regret taking it
But I'm me‚•πThats deep
r/im14abndthisisdeep‚•πBruhh‚•πhe likes it so far‚•π"I'm being polite"
That's usually not a nice thing to say‚•πwhy is it in linux font
i thought all the linux people
were democrats‚•πThat
idk
what linux font is tbh‚•πidk
but
you show me fonts

Ramesh please fix this site
it has no title

saying no to favicons is‚•πSay NO to the USA‚•πfavicons aren't even political
no no no
just imagine
like
in the future
favicons
become political
democrats refuse favicons
because they waste energy

Its the one that has the nice colors‚•πPAL and NTSC‚•πWhen nothing is airing‚•πthe 2 things that do the same thing
but are different
because the US and Europe‚•πMust be different
Why cant the us be normal‚•πI think NTSC came first
that is the US one
but
PAL was better for some reason
cuz it came next
but then
the US didn't wanna switch to PAL
cuz their stuff was already NTSC

How much?‚•πidk
forgot it was released today
just remembered‚•πpeople are weird‚•πim not sure i want another samsung‚•πWhat cpu
does it have‚•π1 x1 3 a78 4 a53‚•πthe entire soc
what is the name of the soc‚•πSnapdragon 888‚•πew‚•πor Exynos 2100‚•πwhat about
exynos
exynos is unlockable‚•πdepends on region
but no hedfone‚•πcan i buy an exynos‚•πno sd
1080p screen‚•πuhm what
what refresh rate?‚•π120‚•πwhy‚•πadaptive‚•πis it
1080p
why
literally why‚•πcuz why not‚•πmy moto x
had a 1440p screen‚•πmy galaxy s4
has a 1080p screen
i mean even apple is beyond that
the iPhone 11 was iPhone 4 level screen
ima just not buy samsung
im done with them
they dont have anything i want‚•πi might
they have exynos‚•πill get a pixel 5 pro‚•πand note‚•πwith 256gb
i would get a pixel 5
but it only has 128
or ill get a oneplus‚•πI might just like
not buy a phone
ever‚•πthat is irrelevant
no once cares
about those‚•πI care‚•πwhy
or maybe a galaxy note
if they fix the issues
with the s21
but like theres no reason to go Samsung anymore
or maybe ill just get an iphone
why not
what do i lose
i get a better screen
more optimized software
more updates
more storage options‚•πwhat
about gewgle‚•πwdym‚•πpixel‚•πiphones are faster‚•πwill they make the same argument‚•πget more updates‚•πto buy a pixel‚•πmore optimized
more storage options‚•πthen get
an iphone‚•πim considering it
im not gonna buy from a company that does not give me what i want‚•πbut you're winning the bet‚•πi will not be brand loyal‚•πoh
just you wait till you get an iphone
soon you will wish you had a mac
he's going to become a stereotypical teenaged mac MERN dev‚•πhahaha‚•π100%‚•πU did‚•πmore like 80%
but close‚•π100%
An exceptional
Unique person
becomes a boring person
because of apple
this is why apple should be deleted‚•πplease
ramesh
stop
with the brand loyalty‚•πWhat brand loyalty‚•πhating apple‚•πthat is not‚•πis brand loyalty‚•πbrand loyalty‚•πit is the same concept
just with not liking a brand‚•πbrand disloyalty
I just
dont
like apple‚•πthe thing is‚•πand i dont
want to hear
why
bye‚•πapple has advantages‚•πi dont care‚•πso my question is
objectively speaking
who makes a better product‚•πI bought apple stock‚•πnew samsungs‚•πthey makin me money‚•πhave no expandable memory
i have lost almost every reason to use a Samsung phone‚•πyea, wich is better for apple, bc they have a better product without the expandability advantage
so its apples to apple‚•πhaha‚•πI have to debate this dumb bill on airline passangers
it sucks‚•πi see
im go eat a snack‚•πthis idiot elitist
mac cultists
i hate apple‚•πI hate apple too
but they make me money‚•πit should be
broken up‚•π"its just business"‚•πall of big tech should be broken up‚•πno
we wouldent have innovation‚•πyes‚•πamazon is cancer‚•πand big r and d‚•πwe would‚•πmonee‚•πno they are becoming anticompetitive‚•πyes‚•πand it needs to stop‚•πlike standard oil‚•πfor innovation
you need
competition‚•πdo u see how much amazon, google apple are all pumping into ai, quantum computing ect‚•πyes‚•πwho cares‚•πbut guess what
do you know‚•πthey are‚•πhow much‚•πanticompetitive
extremely‚•πthey would be pumping‚•πespecially apple‚•πthey wont be able to do it without big monee
also‚•πif they had competitors?‚•πI hope apple can be fractured into a milliion pieces‚•πus small companies after the breakup wont be able to compete with the big ones overseas that will just munch the rest of the marketshare
like samsung
and hawhei
or however u spell
also‚•πtrue
but‚•πhuawei
Âçé‰∏∫‚•πoverseas dont have big tech software‚•πyea, but
we wont be able to make that softwhere
without the big tech mons‚•πthe thing is
when you break a company‚•πthat is why‚•πyou dont break it
you just
separate it‚•πI want them further regulated‚•πso like
aws would become its own thing‚•πnonononoonononono‚•πand amazon shopping would become its own thing‚•πthey did that with lucant technologies and the bell system‚•πand amazon branded products
would die‚•πit all fell downhill from there
that is why for those smaller things we need regulation
not seperation‚•πi think my dad works for one of their pieces
after they broke off
i just hope like‚•πyea, my grandpa was like a head at bell labs and was an exucutave at lucant‚•πthe government could like‚•πbefore the scandle things‚•πregulate amazon‚•πyeaaa‚•πso that they dont crush startups‚•πnot break it up‚•πor kill the environment
and mistreat workers‚•πyea, but not breakup
environment would be worse with smaller companies‚•πwell essentially‚•πas with the workets
workers‚•πwhat they have to do is be like
you have 2 choices
1. do the right thing
2. die‚•πno
that is what capitalism does
on its own‚•πthe problem with capitalism
is trust‚•πu get that everywhere‚•πyeah
but so‚•πsomeone is not gonna b more trustworthy if they socilism‚•πyou need to come in and be like
enough
enough is enough‚•πand how would you do that‚•πgovernment
we the ppl
identify
that there is a problem
and say
stop problem
and amazon must obey‚•πwe the ppl indetify there is a problem and go somewhere else to buy our goods‚•πwell that's the problem‚•πinstead of loosing our jobs and working capital‚•πwe the ignorant ppl‚•πwhat is socialism‚•πima eat a snack‚•πhell‚•πbye‚•πwich then with the bad stuff happning rn, would make us more informed
yea. 62%
ima b taxed like a mothafucka
also free stuff
he won
no biden
I support trump and all
but honestly, he did not win
from the facts we have rn
yea
but we cant prove it
like widespred
so we have to keep our heads down
and ride it out
and the best way to do that, is through compromise
so crazy lib agenda does not get passed‚•πok
thanks for your political viewpoints
i do not support stopping the steal‚•πthat is just what I think
as do i‚•πYeah no I get it‚•πalso
i have to debate crazy dumb bill
on airline pilots
sry airline accommodation‚•πnew things‚•πyes
this is genius‚•πno but the link
has a timestamp‚•π16000 for a bathtub
thats just pocketchange
First off
That screen looks hella cool
Second
Yes
Why would u not flush remotely‚•πcuz
ur
supposed
to flush
after
process exited with code 2‚•πBut what if u wanted to do it with an app‚•πwhat annoys me is this
kohler charges like $2500 for "app connectivity"
honestly
thats worse
than
$999
for a monitor stand‚•πHey hey hey
Its a good monitor stand‚•πyes
but this
i mean
apple's $999 stand
looks cheap
compared to this "app connectivity"
which btw i can implement for around $0.38 into most of my applications
like
monitor stands can cost some money
especially if they are good
but app connectivity
is almost
never good‚•πI feel like they would make the investors lustful
by displaying a bathtub‚•πand‚•πit's genius‚•πits really cheap
cy is having fun on youtube

i think he said most of what needed to be said‚•πFun?‚•πthe MongoDB person
the presentation‚•πOh right that was today‚•πyeah‚•πHuh‚•πit was just now‚•πI wasnt gonna attend anyway‚•πSolid‚•πGracias‚•πLiquid‚•πI made notes of the presentation of u want them‚•πNah im good‚•πLike if anyone wants then‚•πI can learn mongo from my dad‚•πwell the presentation was about data science
and machine learning
and the future of data
and tech
he said the word mongodb once‚•πHmm
Seems intresting‚•πYea it wasn‚Äôt too bad‚•πI have to find out why my internet is bad

i guess that's good
i like how of the 25M new users in the 72 hours
0% were from north america‚•πIn what?‚•πnew telegram users‚•πAh
Telegrams good tho
Is nice‚•πhi uma murkin ah yuz ah-messidge‚•πOr whatsapp‚•πliterally no one
in the us

other than like
ppl who wanna talk to ppl outside the US
i mean i remember years ago
like 6 years ago
my Lebanese relative asking me to get whatsapp
WhatsApp is preinstalled on my $25 smartwatch
from chiyna‚•πHaha
Whatsapp is okay‚•πomg i like click on an ltt livestream
and i find linus just like
on the ground‚•π?‚•πthen i turn time back
and its the funniest thing
he literally
tries to limbo under an ethernet cable‚•πDropped himself‚•πfails
then
tries again‚•πOh no‚•πto do a roll
under the cable
but then
theres a pen in his back pocket
and it gets caught on the cable‚•πOh god‚•πthen he moves backwards
removes the pen
then
he rolls
and his legs completely snag the cable
and everything falls
and he falls‚•πPerfect
Linus is great
How
How
How did he do this‚•π*literally dying‚•πI have no words
To explain how magnificent this is
Right here
Add that find out next episode meme‚•πhaha‚•πWhats a good router
My routers busted and i need to get a new one‚•πwdym your router is busted‚•πIdk
Optimum says our router has a problem‚•πidk maybe go for like ubuqiti networks‚•πHence why we dont have internet
Its gotta be relatively cheap
And at bestbuy‚•πoh
this one looks good
for the price
its wifi 6
AX3000‚•πI kinda dont need wifi 6
Cause i dont support it
But sure‚•πow rite
ur a mak person‚•πYup‚•πthen just get literally any of them
idk anything about wifi
routers‚•πis that decent?
Cy todays the first time im gonna be spending like till 11 doing hw
Imma just go to bestbuy and find one
People
I have internet
Its garbage speeds
But it there‚•πI saw this‚•πwhich livestream?
send me a link
i wanna watch later‚•πit was on yt as like a post thing‚•πthis link has a timestamp
this guy
does the best

Hi I'm SHA-256
I don't really know what I like
but I know I don't like you‚•πHi I'm Cy
I don't really know who I like‚•πdo you get the analogy‚•πbut I know I don't like you
No‚•πSHA-265 is a hashing algorithm‚•πYes
I know that
what else‚•πIt does not know your password‚•πthat's good‚•πbut it can tell you what is and is not your password‚•πYes‚•πyknow those moments
where you are like
I dont like that
then someone asks you what you do like
and you tell them
idk‚•πJe gagne
Adieu‚•πwdym
wdym‚•πBruhhh‚•πi click it
and it says
"please be discreet"
"you will now see nude photos"
and im like
no
i dont wanna see em‚•πHahhhahahahha‚•πcy is debugging his humidity control system
it has a bug
where it doesn't work when it first boots up
it like
requires doing things
like
i think
when it first boots up
the humidity has to go below the low threshold before it actually sets the humidifier state correctly
cuz it assumes the system is on
at boot
i believe
wait
no
its the other way around
it assumes its off
and it has to go down below the threshold
for it to confirm it is on
but
well
and then when it rises above the threshold it will stop the humidifier
the problem is this will cause runaway
because if the humidifier is on‚•πCy
Stop‚•πand it requires the humidity to go below the threshold to realize this
it will never realize it
because since it is on
the humidity will keep rising‚•πBruh enough‚•πdnd is a thing
did u study for inglish and komp sci‚•πComp sci not rly
By English yes‚•πwhat is limo‚•πJust studied passive and active voice
And vocab‚•πthis tho‚•πAnd reviewed the questions
Idk‚•πwdym‚•πHow did u study for English‚•πthen
slides
and
sparknotes‚•πWhich slides‚•πim at my "do not go to bed hour"
various ones
on parallelism
and vocab‚•πYea same‚•πand that stuff
see if i go to bed right now
i will be dead tmrw
i have to wait like half an hour‚•πlol‚•πthe reason is‚•πEnjoy your half an hour‚•πmy sleep cycle
i have identified‚•πLol‚•πif i go to bed around half hour before midnight
i am in deep sleep at 6am
and i am dead the whole day‚•πOkay
Thank you for describing your sleep cycle‚•πyou should identify yours‚•πI will now prescribe that you sleeps earlier so you deep sleep comes at a earlier time‚•πyeah its either before 11
or around midnight‚•πI sleep and I wake up... that‚Äôs about it‚•πlol
ima continue debugging my humidity control system‚•πLol go for it‚•πthx
its literal spahgetti kode‚•πOoof‚•πthe worst kind
wait it was the most trivial thing
I thought the second letter of the word ON
was O
god help me‚•πCy
Wth
On is two letters‚•πthe thing is
i was doing
string
or in this case
char array
so like it was string[1]
and somehow i said‚•πWait are u studying for comp sci‚•πif string[1] == 'O': the humidifier is on‚•πHAHAHA‚•πbut that is wrong
in like
so many ways
cuz like
if it is off‚•πR u studying for comp sci‚•πthe first character will be O
but‚•πLol‚•πthat's not the first character
its the second‚•πIk‚•πit was like 2am
im certain
when i was putting that together
my brain worked
and then
it didnt‚•πLmao‚•πthe system is now working‚•πNice‚•πit works over mqtt‚•πI do understand how this works beside the code but nice‚•πthe main reason i was editing the code
was to change the setpoint
because it was set to 50%
and
um
i have various issues with hardwater and ultrasonic humidifiers
creating
mineral dust
and breaking my stuff‚•πLol‚•πlike i think
my numworks
the buttons dont always click right
i think its because
of this issue
and white dust collects on everything
so i moved the setpoint to 35-40
as opposed to 47-53
hopefully this solves my issue‚•πOkay‚•πalso then hopefully i dont have to fill the damn thing up every 12 hours

a revolution in dirt cheap iot
wifi for 38 cents
NOTE: module pictured does not actually cost 38 cents, actual prices may vary based on region and additional features‚•πzxa‚•πhi my phone battery is at 84 percent
it was fully charged this morning
when i woke up
and i used it for one minute
to check the battery percentage
83% now‚•πIm at 53‚•πbut you didn't charge
overnight‚•πIt was charged this morning‚•πbut you used it‚•πYea for like 4 hours‚•πi used mine
for one
minute
literally
1
3 minutes now
wait
maybe i knocked it off the charger
cuz i was not awake 2h20m ago
but really
this is terrible
this is unacceptable
6.4%
it unacceptable
this phone does not get me through one day
with light to no use
that's it imma get a chinaphone
with android one
they dont have enough money make software that uses this much power‚•πmine doesnt either
but to be fair i use it like for 6 hours straight‚•πthis
i used my phone for 1h yesterday
what was i even doing for 1h
im going to buy not a samsung
whats annoying
is like
if i had bought that
i would have already had android 11
that phone is like $300
mi a get android updates before samsungs
the problem is that has an absolutely awful screen
its amoled
and the good ends there
its HD+
that means 720p
a 6.1 inch 720p oled
looks awful‚•πRust time‚•πyes the price is dropping
this is good
it is getting within budget‚•πshould seduction be illegal‚•πhi my battery is at 78%‚•πle get it
and make ur pickle 3 work‚•πno its gonna keep dropping
it was like $95 last time
the lowest‚•πwindow.draw(&self.wrong_guesses);
no‚•πcy wants to add google sign in to a website
but its too much of a mess‚•πNo change

why does this use UDP
isnt UDP old
and bad
and unreliable‚•πwhat am I supposed to use then
CloudSockets?‚•πTCP‚•πwith Blockchain?‚•πwebsockets‚•πWeb
i am allergic
to the web‚•πramesh
its a protocol
you dont have to do webdev‚•πyes
I am‚•πto use websockets‚•πallergic
to
I just wanted to learn
low level stuff‚•πbut you should learn relevant stuff
like TCP
TCP is relevant‚•πAh yes‚•πUDP is not‚•πEveryone telling me what I do is irrelevant
and not worthwhile
+1 to list‚•πwell im just saying the UDP part
but yeah
Rust is not irrelevant‚•πso
I can
program my wii
if that makes me happy I will program my wii
Even though it is not relevant‚•πi mean im just saying‚•πIt doesn't matter to me‚•πif you are gonna make a real time game‚•πwhether or not‚•πuse TCP websockets‚•πOh right‚•πnot UDP‚•πDid I tell you
Minecraft servers use UDP?
Not websockets?
game servers
use
udp‚•πthey are old
also‚•πCan confirm‚•πthey are lossy streams‚•π^ among us‚•πCan confirm
Lots of games use udp‚•πfortnite‚•πEspecially for server stuff‚•πThank you for telling me
UDP is irrelevant
this is ingame, btw‚•πk so i did some look up
and i determined
what it is
TCP has error correction and is good for all thing, but it has overhead
UDP
is dumb
and simple
but
it has much less overhead
so it is better for streaming‚•πIt is better
for games‚•πyes because they need low latency and to stream a lot of data
but
i would still
use TCP websockets
for a game like yours‚•πToo bad
I wanted to do something cool‚•πwdym too bad‚•πAnd like
I used UDP
So
I'm not switching it‚•πbut why do you think udp is a better option
other than that‚•πshow me
the rust api
for websockets‚•πwell that's a rust issue‚•πno
just look it up
websockets
i dont doubt there is one
i just want to make a point
This
sends structs‚•πalso does UDP even have security?‚•πprobably
TLS
I wanted to
implement this myself‚•πlook you do you
im just saying
i would have done it with websockets‚•πUhm
See the goal of this project
was to learn about udp‚•πthen fine‚•πalso
game servers use udp
go tell all the game developers
to use
websockets‚•πones that have to stream
player details
in real time‚•πYes‚•πyou are not‚•πI am doing
that‚•πstreaming
anything‚•πjust so you know
I am streaming
guess events‚•πsuch as‚•πto‚•πno‚•πclients‚•πthat's not a stream‚•πin real time‚•πa stream is like
the position‚•πit doesn't close‚•πof all the Minecraft players
all the sheep
all the cows‚•πhow would you even implement that‚•πall the time‚•πyou have to send packets
one at a time
yes
I am doing that
all the time
there can be more than one game‚•πyou are continuously sending?‚•πat a time
on the server
if the server is being utilized a lot
yes‚•πlike you have a while loop‚•πyes‚•πthat just sends‚•πand threads
to handle‚•πforever
that's inefficient tho‚•πrequests‚•πyou only need to send
when events occur‚•πYes
the thread only spawns
when an event get sent‚•πthe websocket
is better‚•πIdc
I want
to learn
udp
so I did this‚•πthen fine‚•πI really don't think
websockets
would make a huge difference‚•πthey would have a lower error rate‚•πThen
there is no fun
in trying to fix errors‚•πand support browser clients‚•πI literally
do not
care
about
browsers.
period.
I hate web dev‚•πyou are like me 4 years ago
i was like‚•πYes‚•πscrew browsers
i hate‚•πAnd I used to like‚•πweb browsers‚•πbrowsers
web dev
and then it got repetitive
and annoying
and stupid‚•π5 years ago i liked google docs cuz it was browser‚•πso I am done with it‚•π4 years ago
i hated google docs

hi im a cyne function‚•πAh
yoga in gym
fun
I can sit on the floor
and do nothing
for 50 minutes‚•πi has inglish kwiz
gbie‚•πhf‚•πhi i talked with my English teacher
about my YouTube tracker app‚•πwho is your english teacher‚•πHarding
she said she might use it‚•πoh‚•πeven tho she was not the one to ask for it
cuz she told me
well yknow i make videos sometimes
but i doubt my seniors actually watch them
so if i could track that
it would be nice
and maybe i would make more videos‚•πseniors?
oh
seniors‚•πhi Ramesh can i ask you something
do you leave telegram open on a second screen
while doing other things‚•πYes
Usually
depends on what I'm doing‚•πI see‚•πwhy‚•πidk i noticed weird behavior coming from your profile
and i determined this could only be why
so i just wanted to confirm‚•πWhat is the weird behaviour‚•πyou come online and start typing at almost the same time
and you appear to have read my messages
before actually "reading" them‚•πhmm
how does this
confirm what you were thinking‚•πcuz i started doing that myself
and realized
that was how i was appearing
i was reading ur messages
without "reading" them
cy learned how hashes work
so now
he can store users' credentials in his MongoDB‚•πOh
I also learned how hasing works
tell me
how a hashmap works‚•πidk what that is
i learned about its application
in password
and credential management
ramesh
do you have any sites
that use credentials‚•πUhm
Yes‚•πwhich one
and how does it do it‚•πNot hashing
That is a TODO‚•πwell‚•πYou can steal the api keys‚•πthat doesn't use credentials‚•πif you get into the db‚•πit uses API keys‚•πsame thing actually‚•πno
well‚•πthe api key
is literally
a password‚•πok lemme rephrase‚•πjust so you know‚•πsites
that use
accounts‚•πI do
They are not live
but I have made webapps that do
and this multihangman will have accounts‚•πhow do they store passwords
and credentials‚•πin the db‚•πraw
passwords
in the db‚•πhashed
duh‚•πsalted?‚•πmaybe
idk
i dont think so‚•πwhy would u salt‚•πfor 2 reasons i think
the first reason
is so that 2 same passwords
will have different hashes
and the second reason
is it increases difficulty of brute force attacks
if your db is compromised‚•πhuh‚•πcuz like
they can have dbs
of passwords
and their hashes
but
if the hashes are salted
those dbs do not work
now i just need to learn how to store access keys in a cookie
and how to transmit that cookie
to the server‚•πOh right
have fun‚•πevery time a user requests‚•πI gave up with SPAs
they are stupid
est‚•πwhat is SPA‚•πno words for you
I love logic glitches‚•πsingle page applications?‚•πwhat
wdym‚•πSPA = Single page application‚•πno i get that
but like‚•πClick
no do reload‚•πbut why do that‚•πfaster‚•πwhy
you have to load like
evrything
and all the logic
to manage it
the first time
the page is loaded‚•πi think its so u dont have to load anything else
so it may take a bit longer to load initially‚•πima just do it the normal way
and have a login page‚•πhence why they may have like the cool loading thingy‚•πand an app page‚•πi mean thats what most people do
single pages r more for product information and stuff
also mining is intresting as heck
its so clever‚•πOoh
I should learn
Copy you‚•πyea its intresting stuff
blockchain only works cause of miners‚•πI did a bunch of line removal
now I have to write my font resource manager‚•πah yes‚•πnah
im writing an rcfont
RcFont
Based on this
imma make it work first
i have one‚•πhi im a pc; ima mac; and im linix
you dont like me, but i work; you like me, but i dont work; you want to like me, but im a lot of work‚•πonly applies to macs
Literally just so I can do this

the sign in
just takes any username
do not send

they do not appear
send

make them taller
i see
im going back to my sign in page
gbye

now to implement session keys
*sigh
Hi its cy at 2am
i just finished my 150 lines of sign in logic
but it is fully secure and done now
the hell is this ip‚•πhow many requests do u get from russia and china?‚•πidk i got a few last night
but this is the problem‚•πweak‚•πyou see
my server
is behind

and NGINX
and somehow
their ips‚•πohhhhh‚•πare accessing it‚•πhmm‚•πdirectly
ah this is why‚•πIt now
does not look
like horrible rectangle spacing issues‚•πhm‚•πmy sign in thing works now
it even has sessions
so if you logged in on some sketchy computer
you can go to

hamgna
idk‚•πyou can log out individual sessions‚•πzhong guo
deutscheland‚•πhow do i sign in‚•πfrance‚•πno so
create an account‚•πhow
also y upstairs‚•πdont ask‚•πkill?‚•πyes
you can kill sessions
remotely
so like i said
if you open privat browrser
and sign in
then reload
sessions
in the first one
you can kill the session
in the private browser
you can sign out individual sessions
without changing your password‚•πakiru‚•πwait these astats are wrong‚•πUwu‚•πoh thats just last week
this is all of last month‚•πI didn't kill it
it just died
and i didn't undie it
i need to host it on my rpi
cuz it was being hosted on my desktop
which was bad‚•πL‚•πthe problem is‚•πalso‚•πidk how much bandwidth
it uses
and how much CPU‚•πur linkpage is kinda broken‚•πyeah the last link‚•πall of them are the same link‚•πoh that
well notice
how its still
an html xpermient‚•πi hate that color‚•πtoo bad‚•πü§Æ‚•πi should eat food‚•πalso‚•πi just woke up‚•πy does the text move‚•πAPU

you have made
actually ima go do this

ive been doing more backend stuffs
so like‚•πteam lethal esports‚•πmy latest project has no gui
yeah i made that for my friend‚•πI know someone
who runs a team lethal esports‚•πits like some stuff
for the actual analytics i just made it output a table

my main website hasnt been edited in likt 2 years
cuz idrc
cy‚•πyes‚•πhow are the passwords stored
are they hashes or smthn?‚•πsalted hashes‚•πhm‚•πwhy‚•πcan they be unhashed‚•πby definition, no‚•πk‚•πassembly‚•πyes
is it useful to learn asm
wait
imma do something‚•πk
i need to figure out how to delete everything in my database
since im changing how users are made
thats the point tho‚•πyes
so
Consider not glorifying it‚•πhi im facebook

yet
you are my business‚•πM‚•π-M-

bye
i have work‚•πbye‚•πcy its broken
i have to enter a new name‚•πow wait
hold on‚•πalso
how do i make a share‚•πyou dont
yet‚•πhm‚•πi am implementing that
now‚•πalso‚•πyes‚•πeverything goes to that one page‚•πyes
well
not everything‚•πlike i cant see my account‚•πno so
anything
not explicitly set
will go to that page
so that‚•πhm‚•πi can have like‚•πlol‚•πbe a video id
to vew the share‚•πoh cool
but isnt that bad
cuz if u put a video id
what if 2 ppl wanna share that video
then its the same id‚•πno
the shareID
sorry‚•πoh
hm‚•π2 shares can have the same video‚•πwhy is it not somthing like /share/id‚•πbuhcuz i wanita look gud‚•πbecause what if the id is account
then it breaks‚•πthe id will not be account
because
i will make sure
the length of the id
is not the length
of any explicit paths‚•πbut that if i break the thing and send requests of stuff‚•π?‚•πlike the connect4
i can just send random stuff to it
and hack the game‚•πi mean
i can protect
against
that
to a certain extent
i mean‚•πhmmmm‚•πthis is for like
teachers
with
like
non tech
students‚•πlol‚•πno one i know
has like
the intent
to do that
especially in class
or the knowledge‚•πisnt it funny when the technology teacher cant use a computer‚•πthis is not for the technology teacher
this is for the AP Seminar teacher‚•πwhat is that‚•πsome class thats interesting‚•πhm‚•πits kinda hard
but then again
i have a 104% in it‚•πmarketing forgot what an OS is‚•πk
so now
you can put a ytVideoID as the path
and see it work
sort of

flask‚•πtry
ruby on rails‚•πno
for now‚•πthat's the only thing I would use‚•πim not
trying
anything‚•πfor web dev
flask is "cancer"‚•πwhy‚•πit is
slow
to work
ruby is faster to make things wokr
also ruby syntax nicer‚•πi see
maybe next time‚•πplease
that is repeated code‚•π?‚•πi hate lifetimes‚•πik i could do it myself
but no‚•πOk so I uh‚•πwhat‚•πRewrote the entire thing in
raylib
when I could have just fixed the lifetimes‚•π*sigh‚•πas I just did‚•πis this for like
the ui?‚•πso ramesh is a royal idiot
yes‚•πwhy
are you using Rust‚Ñ¢‚•πSince I want to learn how to use it
but it works now so idc‚•πk‚•πalso like
raylib just like magically solved‚•πworks‚•πa really stupid bug‚•πbut‚•πthat I couldn't figure out‚•πnot for real
it like‚•πwhere the program would crash randomly‚•πcan find video ids‚•πnow it doesnt
wow‚•π*yawn‚•πi should sleep too
im making this thing
more ux‚•πi should make (x for x in literally_everything) work‚•πso instead of editing code
yu type in ip
and it saves it‚•πk‚•πerr‚•πi dont feel like working on PlayTools anymore this evening‚•πYes, I like this
pointless windoe

take a photo
upload it to this tool
which turns it into an STL
of like the brightness
then you cut off the bottom margin‚•πHmm‚•πlike the bottom thickness‚•πOikay
and then‚•πcuz its bad
and then‚•πpwint‚•πyou set some settings‚•πokay ill try it tomorroh‚•πmake it thin laier
0.05mm
also
make the first layer thicker

then print‚•π'kay

for calum‚•πyeah lol‚•πso he asks for more‚•πsome random guy
on the internet
gave it to me for 10 years
does this sound like a lie‚•πsounds sus‚•πwell guess what
that is literally what happened
im gonna move it to namecheap and renew for 30 more
after I get some monies‚•πfreenom yeeted mine
so like I'm gonna get a real one‚•πUh
github student developer pack‚•πyea
but that's 1 year
I'm looking for all the options‚•πI have 10
wait
idk just get from namecheap‚•πporkbun‚•πno u‚•πits cheaper‚•πyeah probs am‚•πno‚•πporkbun?‚•πthat one‚•πhm‚•πyea i pay like 20$ a year for my 2 domains
8 for a .com‚•πwait‚•π12 for a .me‚•πwait
wait
wait
can u transfer to porkbun?‚•πyea
they also have 2$ a month email hosting‚•πhm‚•πcost?
if it's cheap I am switching‚•πhm
could I get a year on name cheap and then transfer?‚•πyeah‚•πpog‚•πyea‚•πI'ma probs do that then‚•πstill costs 26 dollars to transfer to pork
how much is pork's email?‚•πoof‚•πno
it's only for my domain
since mine is a .tv
some are free to transfer‚•πoh‚•π2$ a month‚•πNah
ill go fastmail‚•πyea i would as well
they do have free email redirects
which is what im doing rn‚•πhm .me domains are 12‚•πyea they aint bad‚•π.tv tho‚•πlol‚•πyes‚•πcrates?‚•πyes

is it a domain‚•πno‚•πso what is it‚•πdid they email back?‚•πno‚•πdamn‚•πschool is nice
free adobe‚•πit is‚•πmy previous one game me free adobe cs6
but not premiere
unless u found the one from like 1990
my current one will give u a VM with it but only for specific classes‚•πu can pirate it
extremely easily
it's like trivial‚•πcc?‚•πyes
you just
install the free trial
download the patcher
close cc
run patcher
open cc
the end‚•πhm‚•πive done it before
b4‚•πwhat do you see
im sorry
what
does that mean‚•πAccident
but keep it‚•π?
ah good
now
could you
go to
and make a share‚•πno
later‚•πwhy
it takes like 2.5 seconds‚•πok now i will
also add opengraph support
please‚•πwhat is that‚•πgoogle‚•πwhat
you click "use current name"
if that wasnt clear please let me know‚•πit wasnt‚•πhmm
k‚•πwhat does this mean?‚•πso
essentially
"viewers"
are people
"views"
are like
the number of times it was clicked
"viewers" doesn't work yet
cuz essentially
for my teacher
he wants to know how many ppl watched
not how many times
it was watched‚•πme:‚•πno so
it will track

I think I know what you did

nvm
ima not eat dinner
wait
now
ima eat dinner‚•πima try linode dns
wildcard https
ha
mine

mine
mine
mine
that was incredibly easy
also linode has ddos protection with cloudflare‚•πhmm
testing
*sigh‚•πnou‚•πwhupps‚•π*cygh‚•πjust erased my webhook‚•πcyfinfaza: testing‚•πthere‚•πcyfinfaza: there
cyfinfaza: L√†
cyfinfaza: –ë—ã–ª–æ‚•πvk‚•πcyfinfaza: vk‚•πjif you go to
it may work‚•πit may not work
ah if i explicitly state https
since it does not use cloudflare anymore‚•πdoes it work
if you explicitly state
ok
i will fix that
later
it hasn't
propagated for me yet‚•πbut
those
are not
my emotes‚•πum
yes
try
using an emote you uploaded
so like
it was like
working right
before
it works now
i think
right uhm‚•πand i had to explicitly state https‚•πill fix it
i cant test it since it hasn't propagated yet‚•πwdym‚•πit worked
on the test
server‚•πi see‚•πokay
now I can
it is like
having a spasm
nginx misconfiguration‚•πengineks
or enginix‚•πshould I try caddy‚•πsure
i should do homework
but
im listening to music
and i cant do homework and music
at the same time
and i like music‚•πhow do i shutoff unigram?‚•πidk
you can probably like‚•πit wont stop‚•πwdym
like exit
completely?‚•πyea‚•πum
windows settings‚•πi killed it with task manager
and it didnt stop‚•πhaha
idk i never had issues
so idk‚•πi should try mesos
tbh idk what happened
but it should work better now
and now it doesnt
ah
if you add a trailing slash it doesn't work
yes
i fixed that though
works
yes
with https‚•πhow did you do it with linode tho
what did it require‚•πcertbot‚•πno in terms of authentication‚•πAn API key
you can restrict it to only work for domains‚•πyes
now‚•πinstead of being able to work with other stuff‚•πi wish that feature
which is advertised
as working‚•πuse linode instead of cloudflare‚•πin the cloudflare one
actually worked‚•πI got it to work
actually
with cloudflare
perfectly fine‚•πhow‚•πbut
it wont work with
freenom domains
uhm‚•πwhy‚•πidk
i just used like
the pip version‚•πi see‚•πand like
it was finnicky
but after wiping out every other certbot install‚•πi have no need for subdomains yet‚•πand just using the pip3 in root
it worked
werent u like
trying to do this‚•πi was‚•πand like found it
prohibitively difficult‚•πclose to prohibitively‚•πtry again
it works‚•πthe problem is it like
deletes everything
and breaks everything
every time‚•πi think it will work
try it
if you already
installed certbot from pip‚•πi installed it from apt‚•πok remove that‚•πbut then what
will the pip one like
restore all the data
from the apt one‚•πit uses
the same directories‚•πi see
i also
have the cloudflare
one installed
from apt‚•πremove that too
it wont work
itll be outdated‚•πalso idk what other crap I installed
from everywhere
fine lets give this a try‚•πyes‚•πtf is this sequence‚•πokay
let me help
do this
then log out
log in
and then try
oh
you might have installed certbot locally
in which case run‚•πalready running this‚•πwhatever‚•πthis failed
the first one
and this failed
the second one‚•πthis is fine
this means it still worked
now try‚•πshould i log out
and back in‚•πyes‚•πk‚•πtry cloudflare with your restricted token now‚•πsee um
it didn't ask me
for any credentials
file‚•πDid you
do the
uh
like
credentials file‚•πi have one
but
it didn't ask me
for one‚•πwho cares
it doesnt
its not supposed to‚•πthen how should it renew
it needs to renew‚•πit probably remembers‚•πwdym
i never
gave it
the key
how did it validate in the first place?
there was some thing in my dns
lemme try again without that
*sigh
no
it still
doesn't work‚•πidk
it works for me
ill just like
manually renew mine‚•πyknow what it might be
im on ARM
and maybe its not compiled‚•πoh uhm
no
no‚•πfor arm‚•πno
no
no
add ur email
keep the token
add ur email‚•πwdym‚•πadd‚•πwhy
i only have 2 tries left‚•πdns_cloudflare_email‚•πthen i have to wait a week‚•πidk it works like that
also this doesnt take tries
ur not like
making one‚•πeach time i retry it
it takes
one‚•πit only counts if it works‚•πof the 5 attempts
per week
yes but
it works
every time
for some reason‚•πsend me
the entire output
of the previous attempt
not the snippet
it only did it once‚•π?‚•πit only worked once didn't it‚•πyes‚•πi dont see it making a certificate more than once‚•πonly the first time
no
it like
this is the last attempt
of 3‚•πykw idk
i just use
linode
and be happy‚•πwhat i dont get
is how it works
the first time
and not
when it renews
it works the first time
regardless of everything‚•πthis is very clear
the rest of it
heres
the thing
it should renew‚•πbut how come
it requires no credentials
or anything‚•πit stores‚•πwhen you first run it‚•πthe file‚•πi inputted
no file‚•πit says
credentials‚•πthe first time
this‚•πfull screenshot
oh
bc it recorded ur file already
thats how‚•πbut i just installed it
how‚•πit
doesnt delete
ur old configuration
stuff‚•πit had tho
because‚•πit doesnt
delete
/var/certbot
or whatever‚•πthis happened
after that‚•πthat's
not wildcard‚•πwhat
it is tho‚•πidk
idk
look idk‚•πi see‚•πit works
hence
ramesh shall ignore it‚•π?‚•πfor me‚•πah‚•πand technically for you
just so you know
back in the old days
there were no plugins.
so you had to manually do it
and then wait 12 hours
and then try certbot
and hope bad things no happen‚•πi think for now
ill just stick
to regular certs‚•πmhm
well i needed a wildcard for emotes‚•πwhen i need wildcard
i will cross that bridge
when i get to it
but also
mq02 is broken
*tired
*has some hw
*will not fix mq02
*no not tonight‚•πthis‚•π._.‚•πyes
that is a thing
it was written by teenagers
probably‚•πi like how kognise claims
to be
some 13 year old‚•πhe is like 14 right
also
it's <13 not <=13‚•πtbh idk the whole deal with kognise
and doggo
and all that business‚•πhe ignores me
I tried to file a bug report with him on discord‚•πreally?
he answered me‚•πI also thanked him for the service and he ignored me
but
if he's busy ig that makes sense‚•πhow tho
like i dont get it‚•πparents
freedom‚•πwdym how tho‚•πhow does a 14 year old‚•πget a card‚•πi mean
i guess‚•πi could‚•πthey are not 13‚•πnot
idk
i was 14 in ninth grade
and I knew flask
so‚•πtrue
i need to write a privacy policy for playtools
and add bad person protection
jp was like
ppl are gonna come
and break it‚•πjp
is correct‚•πhow do i implement that tho‚•πjust say "I added encryption" to him
and he will stop
saying anything‚•πno hes like
ppl are gonna script it‚•πik
just say‚•πcuz you totally can‚•πi added encryption
Literally those words‚•πwell actually
its behind
cloudflare
under high protection mode
so likely not‚•πhaha
i wonder what I'm doing wrong
nothing
this book is filled with swear words‚•πhm‚•πlets go
Collegeboards dropping SAT subject tests
and the essay on the actual SAT‚•πwdym‚•πu can no longer take the subject tests‚•πwhat‚•πand they r no longer offering the essay‚•πlink to source plz‚•πits for the pandemic but they may continue it
NYT also has an article‚•πhmm
i like this
it means a more even playing field‚•πi mean AP exams are like 100 bucks each but yea
its nice
but its annoying as heck‚•πwhy‚•πi needed either a 5 on 3 AP exams or 700+ on 3 subject tests‚•πfor what‚•πadmission requirements‚•πfor what‚•πfor University of Oxford‚•πbut i mean
if there are no more subject tests
they will update that‚•πits not a US school‚•πbut
then
wait
is collegeboard an American thing
or is it global‚•πYes
American
but they have global locations‚•πbut then like
i mean if the university wanted subject tests
they cant be like
oh you still need subject tests
that you cant take‚•πi mean yea
thats prob why they added an AP part as well‚•π*sigh
im working on playtools

cy is dealing with timestamps
the worst thing
to deal with
idk if they are even all in UTC
i think
my timestamps are all in UTC
but
i need to make sure
so that if i run my app in Iowa
it wont cause all my times to be messed up
but then also
i need to make sure that all the times are displayed in EST for users
and now
they are displaying in EST
but
idk whether
that is
no
this must
end
i hate
this
there is EDT
as well
a;sdlfkaj;sdlkfj;aslkdjfasdf

i lived in Bridgewater‚•πReally?‚•πyes‚•πI don‚Äôt remember anything from back then‚•πi watched on the big tv downstairs
in my pajamas
then
i got tired
and realized
i didn't care
and went to sleep
then i woke up
and my mom
an anti-trumpist
came to me
and told me that trump had been elected‚•πin 7th grade
we stood up
and said "not my president"
on inauguration day
CRUD‚•πwhat

Im trying to figure out what im gonna say for my gym flipgrid
I have no clue what to do besides life a textbook up‚•πcome on
30 seconds
you can do it
this is my
uh
pause for 5 seconds‚•πYea but‚•πresistance‚•πIt has to be creative‚•πtool
pause for 10 seconds
then be creative
sound happy‚•πU gotta say more than that
U gotta say like why weight training is good‚•πyes
i did this in like 1 minute
it took me 0 time
you have been doing this since like
yesterday‚•πWell no
Its more like i put it off till today‚•πI see‚•πAnyone want an intel mobo for $135 lmao‚•πum
not for $135
bot protection.
at least for sign up
this site cannot persist
it needs to end‚•πmaybe
like
big maybe but maybe
i will think about it‚•πIf not I will probs j go to eBay‚•πit no work
whenever I go off the page
it no stop video
or Is it just to log
whoever watched the video‚•πit is supposed to just log
it keeps playing even when you leave the page
although
well
yeah no it would not be very easy to implement that‚•πmq
cy
cy pic
from cy's channel‚•πwait

i like to play with open apis
why is this Ramesh's profile picture‚•πWhat is that
Do you know‚•πno‚•πAkhil might know
like‚•πits probably like
stormlight archive
related‚•πyes‚•πif you go to
you will now see
some images
that are badly formatted‚•πvery‚•πlook i was like
lets do math homework
then i was like
wait i now comprehend the meaning of life
and then i was like
5 minutes
and i was like
yes
and so
my 5 minutes
resulted in images
but
not in formatting‚•πI do all my happiness stuff after school
and then I
do work
and then I
sleep‚•πso you are a me first
hw second‚•πYes‚•πperson
i see
akhil
is not‚•πsee
if I did a homework first
me second
I would never get to the me part‚•πikr that's what always happens with me its like
not to get all psychological
but
1.
there is more of a "guilt" to skipping an assignment to do me stuff instead of an assignment
like when i say
no we can do this tmrw
time to do me stuff
and 2.
time after homework is more "free" and ends up wasted more often‚•πYes
I agree
Usually in the night
I don't feel like doing stuff‚•πwith that said tho
i would like
not to be stressed in the evening
and 1 and 2 are solvable problems
so i am working towards a fully hw first, or hybrid hw/me first schedule
to properly deal with everything‚•πno
I like how it is now‚•πi dont‚•πdoing me stuff makes me thoroughly satisfied
so I can do work
for the rest of the day
also do you ever just tire of people‚•πsee i am never satisfied‚•πand hope they never talk to you again
even if they will‚•πi mean
sometimes
somewhat‚•πhow do you solve that
do you just
tell them
'no i dont wanna talk to you'‚•πno‚•πsince that's mean and it might result in problems later‚•πcuz usually they are very nice ppl‚•πyes
those people who keep talking to you
are very nice ppl‚•πi dont usually solve that issue‚•πwho dont say no‚•πi just let it sit‚•πwho will never ever say no‚•πyes‚•πbut instead say things
instead of no
like instead of saying
'i wont tell you'
they will say
'it is a secret'‚•π*yawn

that her ideas
were impossible‚•πwhat ideas?‚•πshe was like yeahhhh‚Ä¶.
at least impossible for me to do‚•πDid she get mad‚•πno she was like yeahhhhh...
ik
and then she was like
still
thinking‚•πuh the second one is what every teacher does‚•πabout when i told her about password hashing
last week
wdym
no like hide it after it has already been posted‚•πah‚•πand completed
like
she wants
to
do this:‚•πWell u aint google so u cant do those‚•πput all students in breakout rooms
that she can visit
secretly
create a test with google docs on google classroom
post the assignment
start the test
then
if ppl go over, it highlights red
and then
after everyone is done
she wants to hide the assignment from the students
so they cant click it or see it anymore
and then she can show it temporarily for students who need makeup
that is what she wants‚•πDo this‚•πHonestly
It is possible‚•πPretty sure google has a possible features thing right?‚•πjust make my own test platform
told her
she said‚•πWhere u can post ideas‚•πalready asked‚•πHuh
Hold up
Why?
Exactly‚•πwell that would be the solution
but‚•πThank go„ÅÆ‚•πgoe
and so
it was determined
that we could not do this
also
what teacher
would use a test platform
made by
one of their
students‚•πNone
Cause we cool kids
And can haks‚•πalso
i own it
so i can just like
get in‚•πI mean
U could make one‚•πtbh it probably wouldnt be to hard‚•πAnd give it to the IT department‚•πyou get some open source web document editor
haha those non-brains
they make all our passwords the same
and buy new dell computers
during the pandemic‚•πRight i need to make a cool kid password generator/thingy‚•πpassword generator or manager‚•πBoth‚•πso like lastpass‚•πYea
But wont connect to the internet‚•πI see‚•πSekurity‚•πimagine i add 2fa to playtools‚•πIt cant be that hard‚•πno

*cygh‚•πwe are back at the amphitheater
cy is very excited
cy likes the amphitheater at PVP
its non-standard
and it means cy gets more fun jobs
cy now understands why certain larger websites do not use Let's Encrypt
Trust
some corporations do not want to trust modern, free, untested cert authorities
they want to stick with the old, paid, well known, and well-tested ones
if let's encrypt has a data breach
or there is some bad actor there
all user data
could be breached‚•πYup‚•πwithout anyone knowing
a secret attack
and thus‚•πI like the old ones
They r nice
It was super easy to install mine‚•πidk letsencrypt is pretty easy‚•πWithout port 80‚•πwell u can do letsencrypt without port 80
how‚•πSee my home network ‚Äúblocks‚Äù port 80
Idk‚•πbut how did you install ur cert‚•πI said i had an email server on it‚•πor validate it‚•πSo it asked me to put in the email
And it emailed the ‚Äúadmin‚Äù
Idk what the entire deal with it was
But namecheap just let me validate and install it on the server‚•πyeah i mean if you go through your provider
then they will just do it
in fact
maybe GoDaddy just has ssl certs for me‚•πOn a pi
My domain registrar just gives me certs‚•πso i dont have to deal with this letsencrypt wildcard stuff
ima check GoDaddy‚•πIm trying to figure out a good naming scheme
Cause my hostnames and users r really random‚•πi see
bonjour je mappelle French class
google docs

14 years old
they must have started development in like 2005
like when i was born
no wonder they dont use websockets
like everyone else
websockets are only 10 years old
Wait
although apparently Microsoft had this in the 90s
just not based on Web 2.0 obviously
but of course
who could forget‚•πMay I remind you
You are born in 2004

No i do not i like acrylic i guess not look i have antennas coming in the mail tmrw.
But you see I noticed a lot of attention to detail in deepin that I do not see elsewhere but you would not qualify for AP capstone i believe the ink will bleed.
Caburum: I don't get this
Bootcamp i dont want it yea you dont need Autodesk i paid $300 i think.‚•πI identified and fixed the 18k days bug
in playtools
what was happening
was that
sometimes
the player reports "pause"
before it reports "play"
and so it starts as start:0 last:0
then when it pauses it becomes start:0 last:actualtime
then when it plays
it does not set the start time
because the last time was within 20 seconds
and then when it is done
the times are subtracted
and hence 18k days
so the solution
is to not run the pause code unless the video is actually playing
so that bug should now be fixed‚•πhuh
so marqueez is fixed?‚•πIdk where it is now is it tho? except it is yellow round.‚•πah bots kinda working
nobody send any commands‚•πcdknight: did you literally get everyone to go to school

electron go out mosquitto small a night lamp‚•πwhere‚•πmy site had a spasm
and generated 1700 player instances
way to fill the database
that was like 25 seconds‚•πhow
did you
do that
cy
just like how‚•πessentially
it was like
hey server
server is like NO GO AWAY
and its like k ill reload
hey server
NO GO AWAY
k ill reload
hey server
NO GO AWAY
and it just got stuck
that being said i oughta figure out what happens if my database fills up
i only have 500MB‚•πwait she had two wives
huh‚•πbut i have like 3 tabs of this open
tbh im surprised
1.
Cloudflare is actually letting this through
2.
its Edge that's dying not Werkzeug‚•πdiesel is garbage
Wth are you doing
sorry‚•πdevtools has died
stress testing
idk what im stress testing
but its really stressed‚•πi forgot to join
the table‚•πi kinda want it to fill my database
but its taking too long
so ill just directly run the generate player function
in a while loop
until death comes‚•πhow do I cargo test‚•πcuz i need to know what happens‚•πMeow
MERWOJRWOLIER
RAWR
I have work
due on a Friday night.
in two classes
how dare they‚•πi have work today too
not much tho‚•πill do mine l8r
i wanna read a book‚•πi wanna fill my database
ima go do that
bye‚•πThe animations on this game are just so smooth
they get all the little things right even though like the network stuff doesn't work\‚•πto my database‚•πslow‚•πk but at 300 bytes per document
that's a lotta documents
100k
i finally killed it‚•π*claps*‚•πthat took‚•πWhat does it do?
Does it delete excess
Or does it not let you upload‚•πno it just raises exceptions
but i mean
it took
1.3 million
players‚•πDamn‚•πi did it in about 10 minutes
but i had to like
extract exactly what i wanted to write
make 1.2 million copies of it‚•πthis is what they used for osu‚•πand then write them
with insert_many
so
i think
i should be fine‚•πHuh
Whats osu?‚•πa game
ud probably like it
has to do with japanese stuff‚•πEhh i dont actively seek out games with japanese stuff
But i like when it comes up
Like cyberpunk
It ended up having a decent bit of japanese stuff‚•πhow is cyberpunk?‚•πIve been enjoying it
A lot‚•πMaybe‚•πhaha im a google service now
what if i left it as Google Product Sans
also you cant sign into playtools
its dead
i have to delete all those players‚•πillegal‚•πTake the google font
Change it slightly
Bam its not illegal anymore‚•πyes
yknow i dont actually like some of the characters
i erased all the players‚•πno
ramesh hates
implementing crud operations
Kognise's status is a transgender flag
does that mean he is transitioning to a she
if so this makes this doubly strange
people go into the hack club community one gender and come out another
it's happened more than once‚•πHold on‚•πand there is a very active LGBTQ community there
it's almost as if
something is causing them
to become gay‚•πWe cant jump to conclusions yet‚•πor transition
etc
or
they could just be like‚•πWhat if he/she/they just support them‚•πtrue
but still
they actually are different‚•πHow does one ‚Äútransition‚Äù‚•πbut at the same time seeing so many LGBTQ people could make them question their own sexuality
and gender
it's happened to me
so they can just get like‚•πDo u just one day say imma be a she‚•πand then u get a surgery
or something‚•πWait actually?‚•πuh yes
and then
u start dressing like a girl‚•πHuh‚•πthis doubt
because of so many people being gay and transgender around you
is that a thing
and then you question yourself so much
you transition‚•πYea‚•πthat is concerning
i get it if it's separate‚•πPeer pressure?‚•πyeah‚•πSome extended family member of mine did this‚•πi think its more of a ‚ÄúDelusion‚Äù of a status quo
like u join a community
where this is apparent/mainstream‚•πno I think there are people
who are actually gay
and actually transgender
but maybe not all of them‚•πik‚•πbut peer pressure
not even pressure
it's more like
"there are so many"‚•π^‚•πYeah‚•πthere r so many that u kinda think that its just the thing‚•πEven if there are actually thing
yeah
im like
idk how to feel about it‚•πhonestly
if peer pressure is doing something‚•πI thought conversion therapy is illegal‚•πits kinda concerning‚•πyes
hack club‚•πif u wanna change ur gender go ahead‚•πdo it on your own‚•πi have no problem with that
but if a community kinda makes u
thats a problem‚•πbut like i feel like the amount of things that you see about lgbtq
makes you wonder if you are yourself
so ur mind is like
skewed‚•πits like depression in a way
everyone says they r ‚Äúdepressed"
but no one is actually depressed‚•πthey say that
they are depressed
to lower their expectations for their life
so when they exceed their expectations
they are happier
this is why people say "im stupid"
"im gonna fail"
"im sad"
etc‚•πthat makes sense yea
lower ur expectations
so any result exceeds them‚•πYep
That's what people in my grade do
honestly my grade is cursed‚•πthats what every grade does‚•πwell
u see
i dont know anyone in my grade
so i only get to see that people
do that‚•πits kinda apparent in my grade
i mean
theres also a flipside
ur also lowering other peoples expectations of u‚•πyeah well
not always
they might just
inherently think ur smart
no matter what you say
the problem is I feel like there's that pressure on me
even if I literally know no one in my grade‚•πCause sterotypes?
like asians are smart‚•πno
since I got
a 103 on a precalc test last year‚•πah‚•πand got very high grades in that class overall‚•πidek how u get above 100‚•πcurve + doing really well
when everyone else failed‚•πhuh
we havent had any curves this year‚•πthe thing is‚•πbut im also in cp so‚•πyeah
well the thing is
now that they see ur smart
what they do is
they pretend you are a sharp saw in a shed
and like using you
to cut their trees
without appreciating their tool
or caring for it
so eventually the saw is going to stop working for them.
is how I like to use this analogy
I am the saw‚•πi was about to say
thats oddly specific‚•πit's a good analogy
right‚•πyea
but how r they using u?‚•πtrying to
talk to me
just for the sake‚•πah‚•πof repeatedly
asking me
school questions‚•πi hate that‚•πMhm
I do too
it's also only girls
boys never do that‚•πreally?‚•πBoys do it sometimes
much more rarely
and the ones that do ask for school stuff
talk to me about other things‚•πyea‚•πit's not like
I can't
talk to girls
it's more like for them it is out of bounds
and they refuse
becuase they only want me
for their
usage‚•πmanipulation at its greatest‚•πtbh
this may not be 100% true
im just mad about something
and I need to rant about it
so I can get it out of my system‚•πgo ahead‚•πlike
I had another friend
where
she used me like crazy
not for school
but for programming things for her
but at the SAME TIME she also talked to me about other stuff too
and like
I thought her as a friend
hmm
wait
im just like thinking about my life
this is funny‚•πah its philosophy time
i like philosophy time‚•πthis is making me
regret my life decisions more
but it's fine‚•πbruh‚•πhow tf was I supposed to know
that i would be treated this way‚•πits a bit to early for u to start regretting decisions‚•πeh‚•πu dont‚•πi already regret more than this
exactly‚•πthats what life is‚•πso then
ugh
I guess you learn at the same time
then what about the friend
the friend
who treats you like a friend
then all of a sudden refuses to do so
but only asks you for school help
and refuses to talk about anything else
and extend the scope of your fake "friendship"
now thats extra special
in terms of weirdness‚•πthat takes a special kind of person‚•πbut why
why would a person act so special
why
why would they suddenly decide
they want to terminate your tiny friendship‚•πhmmm
i mean there could be many reasons
but its kinda a messed up way‚•πwhat if they weren't actually
like
treating you as a friend
but rather as a person that they didn't know
and being ¬´ polite ¬ª to you
I hate that‚•πan acquantance?‚•πsigh
i mean
friend = acquaintance
just replace those words
I have a tendency to confuse them‚•πwell they r vastly different‚•πnot really‚•πi mean for me‚•πit can be blurred‚•πa acquantance is someone i am confortable speaking to
a friend is someone i talk to often/outside a class
i mean yea it can‚•πYes
what if you talk to someone outside of class‚•πthats where the lines kinda blur
i mean ive had people talk to me just for school
and i treat them as acquantances‚•πidk
ramesh is weird
he has friendship aspirations‚•πdont we all‚•πI mean like I usually dont‚•πi would just count myself lucky to have met people in elementary school‚•πI had no friends
until high school
I mean maybe one or two from middle school
and all my middle school friends left me‚•πi mean some have
some of my good friends ‚Äúleft‚Äù
or moved away
But this kinda saved me‚•πmhm‚•πcause most of my current friends rn ive known for 4-6 years‚•πmost of my friends rn
ive known for like
2-3‚•πyea‚•πim writing a poem about the saw analogy‚•πyes
es bueno‚•πnot done yet‚•πueehhhaeaeaeeeaeeeeyyy‚•πQuality resolution‚•πthis pronunciation‚•πOkay wait lemme ask this
Does the L make a sound‚•πno‚•πWhy‚•πit's french‚•πbecause it controls the other things‚•πyou don't say
the last thing‚•πyeah you almost never pronounce
the last letter‚•πHuh‚•πof any French word‚•πBut if it was english
Would u say it‚•πthat is not an English word
it has no direct translation
i dont think‚•πHuh‚•πit means "home"
but like‚•πIntresting‚•πFrench has two words for "to know"
English does not have these two words‚•πyes
conocer‚•πthere is savoir‚•πand saber‚•πand connaitre‚•πaka
savoir
and conna√Ætre‚•πAh
English is a weird language‚•πsavoir means to know something, like a fact‚•πyes
connaitre is like
to know a place‚•πconnaitre means to know something like a person, or a concept‚•πor like to like know a person
intimacy maybe‚•πyes‚•πthat might be the word
but you see cy‚•πit is a more "intimate" know‚•πakhil already knows this‚•πLike conocer‚•πsince he knows what conocer and saber are‚•πYea‚•πin spanish‚•πyes i would assume
pronounce‚•πca ·∫Ω
nasal e
pronounced like
aw
but nasal
and the a is like a in father or cat idk
i think it's the former‚•πits not can

the notorious webassigns‚•πmost of them r fine
but this one
is not
this webassign‚•πwhich one r u doing‚•πis the first one
where i get a question
wrong
um‚•πhuh‚•πthe one due today‚•πis it 6.5?‚•π6.2‚•πi have tong so mine are already done
ah
people said that one was bad
it was ez for us‚•πmost of the questions were trivial
but there were like 3
that were just not
in the notes‚•πI'm almost done with my physics homework
this is fun
only took 1¬Ω hours‚•πfisiks
do you have to take a study hall to take fisiks‚•πÎÑ§‚•πare you tho‚•πno‚•πyou do
for ap fiskisk‚•πfisiks‚•πhuh
u have to take a study hall?
ugh‚•πso you only take one elective ramesh‚•πyes
which is
APUSH‚•πah
right
ugh idk what electives i wanna do next year
i finished Career i think‚•πim doing‚•πi gotta do animation‚•πap psych and ap econ next year‚•πand im doing 2 art electoves this year
i wanna do ap econ‚•πand AP Research‚•πi have art and career‚•πi also have to do financial lit‚•πwhat were the other elective requirements?
thats it besides financial lit right‚•πthis tho‚•πim doing it over the summer
stop
stop
pls‚•πwhat is it
i need to answer it
and idk it‚•πdo scientific
2.55*10^7
dont ever make them decimals like that‚•πwhy tho‚•πcause its easier‚•πbut what is the answer‚•πand our webassigns only accept em like that‚•πhow do you solve it‚•πah this one
u need to do a couple of equations
ur given joules‚•πi did the energy to wavelength one‚•πyea so find out wavelength that would produce that amount of joules‚•πbut then what
cuz i did that‚•πthats the answer
in meters‚•πbut then
why
doesn't it work‚•πcalculate frequency first then
and calculate wavelength from that to check‚•πwait i might have typed something wrong‚•πalso make sure u used plancks constant correctly
6.626e-34‚•π*sad
i has
dyslexic
i read
6.26
instead of 6.626‚•πnice one chief‚•πand 7.36
instead of 7.63‚•πnice one‚•πi still got a question wrong tho for the first time
since like september‚•π*cough
i get one wrong every time‚•πnot this question
this one‚•πmetal frequency wavelength
a lot of people got that one wrong‚•πyeah it must have been‚•πeven tho it can legit be simplified
to just metal and frequency‚•πhi i have grades‚•πor even just metal and intensity
good job‚•πi have a B in english
why
lets see
ah its cuz im not that good at english‚•πi am not as well‚•πhi im genesis
i tell you ppls student ids
in the url bar
and hence access to everything they own‚•πyup
Cy William Westbrook
u r correct‚•πyes
CWW
my name is shorter
Cy‚•πthen ur initials
dang‚•πthan‚•πimagine having a middle name‚•πfix you're grammer‚•πno i shalln't‚•πwait
you have a
middle name‚•πdid you not know this‚•πramesh's attention
gets piqued
by middle names
no I did not‚•πi mean u told me i think once‚•πMy parents were like
what if he doesn't like being Cy
Hi my name is Bill‚•πhi
i has grades‚•πThank u
I was about to be pissed‚•πyou get to see any one grade
but only one‚•πGym‚•πreally akhil‚•πhaha‚•πThats all that matters‚•πits like the fiji water‚•πyou see one‚•πremember that‚•πyou choose wisely‚•πHmm?‚•πyou get one free item from the vending machine
and akhil chooses‚•πThat was great‚•πthe fiji water‚•πmentos
no he choose mentos‚•πno the fiji water
the most expensive
most useless
thing‚•πI chose fiji water‚•πwhat does cy choose‚•πno i did not choose
this was‚•πI gave it to cy i think‚•πreal‚•πno it wasn't‚•πno‚•πyou give it to cy‚•πyou kept it
i didnt‚•πno
well
im discarding akhil's request
unless‚•πU also got a free one‚•πcy also chooses fiji‚•πno
i choose
like
idk lemme look at them‚•πHe chooses lemonade
I usually get a snapple‚•πyes
i would choose lemonade‚•πAnd one time someone forgot to end the card transaction‚•πso what is lemonade‚•π*remembering time before covid...‚•πMinute maid lemonade‚•πyes‚•πno what does it translate to‚•πSo i chose the most expensive‚•πon the table‚•πFiji water‚•πAkhil stole someone's money‚•πThat was the best water i ever drank
No no no‚•πwait
you bought the fiji‚•πI did not steal‚•πwith someone else's money
HILARIOUS‚•πno so essentially‚•πThey forgot‚•πthe machine
like‚•πstealing‚•πif you dont click‚•πik‚•π"end transaction"
and you walk away
the next person
can just click something
and it will just buy it‚•πSo i didnt know
So i apple payed it‚•πon the last person's card
no so you did‚•πBut the payment never actually went through‚•πcuz you tole me‚•πNo we found out after didnt we?‚•πi found out from you
that you knew‚•πI found after
I think‚•π*sigh
it was not as bad as the cortana incident‚•πThat
Was
The
Best
Damn
Thing
I
Ever
Did‚•πOh
it was
i dont remember it
but
i know it‚•πCy had set Cortana to some button‚•πwhy do my friends like to trick me‚•πOH it was his pen
so i stole the pen from him and kept activating cortana
and he didnt know wtf was happening‚•πyeah
and he like
thought his computer was problematic
and was enjoying it‚•πi did what cy does‚•πup to the point
he realized
akhil took his pen‚•πi think i was dropping hints
and he still didnt figure out
till i made it blantaly obvious‚•πyes
cy is mildly
gullible
but also
he doesn't care‚•πhe may not
but u gotta admit
that was so funny‚•πit was
frankly though‚•πah the things that i did last year‚•πit was also somewhat defeating
because
ik
i will never be able to trick anyone
like that‚•πi dont even know how i got the pen‚•πyou um
opened
my pencil case‚•πcause u like keep watch of it‚•πand took it‚•πah
so it was my skills of theft
i see‚•πi oughta trick ona you
whilst you are not paying attention‚•πplease do‚•πi did it to calum once
it was the simplest thing
at the 4H fair
he was annoying me
so when he went to sit down
in his chair
i removed
the chair
and he fell
to the ground
ungracefully‚•πah
the classic
it takes a decent bit of skill tho‚•πyes
it does‚•πcause they cant notice the chair is pulled‚•πno you do it at the very last moment‚•πu gotta do it while they are about to sit‚•πjames remembers
another funny moment
at 4h
so like
james
has 2 straws
for his bubble tea
and they are attached
and so this little girl comes over
and sees the straw
and shes like
"that's a really long straw"
and her dad is like
"well you dont hear that from girls really often do you?"‚•πHAHA‚•πit was the funniest thing
literally
the little girl is like
so lost‚•πthats great
that dad is a chad‚•πi see
ramesh is here‚•πwait
that is
an innuendous thing to say
‚Ä¶
and it's a little girl too so it's more sketchy
‚Ä¶ how to make of this je ne sais pas‚•πever stop to think,
and forget to start again?‚•πProportionally related‚•πcompletely un related‚•πU know what i wanna do‚•πwhat‚•πI wanna transcribe a book‚•πwdym‚•πHi‚•πIg transcribe aint the word‚•πplease‚•πBut i wanna copy a book‚•πwhy‚•πLike pen and paper

telegram bot code thing
this is stupid
garbage boilerplate idk
k nvm
im dumb
"Compiling"
can this literally compile faster
i have
a very expensive cpu‚•πyes
i know‚•πand I want my code to compile in seconds
not‚•πCant u tell it to use more threads?‚•πi use python‚•πlong‚•πwe dont compile‚•πi think it just like uses
max threads‚•πReally?
I thought it just uses a default
Like 4‚•πuses goddamn
shared libs
stupid‚•πDamn‚•πstupid‚•πNice tmux bar‚•πshut up
bully‚•πIts a nice color tho‚•πstill‚•πThe bars just ugly‚•πits Wrabel‚•πramesh is being an idiot
ive been wolling the wrong stuff
unsurprising‚•πi was like lets watch the news today
maybe we get something new‚•πGood music‚•πblu ray face‚•πah‚•πcy‚•πima listen to that one‚•πcan see what im listening to rn‚•πwhich song‚•πIdk i like the entire album‚•πi see‚•πU prob wont
Cause its pop/rock/heavy metal‚•πno i remember that album
from 5th grade‚•πAh then ur fine
Is good music‚•πit is good
i didn't like it much at the time
but also
i didn't like anything
at the time‚•π^_^‚•πi really wanna see Ramesh's bot
and if it works‚•πthis library
compiles
slower than the linux kernel‚•πwasnt that their like one hit
in 2015
that like pushed them
into relevance‚•πUm‚•πramesh knows no songs‚•πBlurryface?‚•πyeah‚•πIdk i like their old music as well‚•πhave you heard of OK GO‚•πNope‚•πhold on
yes
heard that
like the first song‚•πEs bueno‚•πone of the best music videos
along with most of the rest of theirs‚•πi think my physics teacher shared an okgo video‚•πentire thing shot on a drone at half speed
in one take
not multiple clips
no have not heard that‚•πI like the band
Oh no
Not monogatari‚•πwhy
it's
catchy‚•πIs it?‚•πlisten to it‚•πsome "boy bands"
but they are good
oh and of course
cant forget
there was this girl in drama club
absolutely obsessed
with 5sos‚•πgirls are obsessed with music
there
i made a perfect generalization‚•πAh‚•πyes
males‚•πThem‚•πyes
them‚•πta men
‰ªñ‰ª¨ means them in chinese‚•πi suppose
you have not heard
of the songs
i
post
not i the latter ones you did
who could forget‚•πAh‚•πOdd Chap‚•πIts not bad
Its kinda jumpy
I only like the beginning‚•πi like this spotify background‚•πYes
Only 146k‚•πits Haywyre
makes some of the better remixes‚•πthese‚•πYes‚•πcaravan palace‚•πakhil
idk
this arabic song
is from the nokia ringtone‚•πHmm?
Is it?
I cant listen rn cause i dont have headphones near by‚•πwait
youtube
just
became
a PWA
it wasnt before‚•πLeave it to alphabet‚•πakhil
listen to the arabic song‚•πramesh‚•πI dont have headphones‚•πmake your bot‚•πIll listen first thing tmrw‚•πhi im line us‚•πblast
it‚•πmake it‚•πit is compililng‚•πi wanna see
what‚•πfor cgods sake‚•πhow long
does it take
to compile‚•πit is running
add it‚•πi can compile the entirety of Mbed os
faster than this‚•πwait i need to make the bot respond‚•πyes
you do‚•πima switch libraries
this one is bad‚•πits linus
and ramesh
ah conro
that canadian‚•πfor gods sake this is an async
sad‚•πworking for Monstercat
PlayTools can be run serverless
i think ima run it serverless‚•πhow‚•πon some provider
wdym‚•πthat provider
is a server
FYI‚•πyes
but serverless in the sense
that i dont pay for
or manage
a server
so its cheaper
and easier
and maybe faster
in fact
if i wrote the whole thing in javascript
I could run it directly on Cloudflare's edge network
with Workers
for maximum speed
but it relies on the DB
which is slow
so it wouldnt make much of a difference
although maybe if i could offload the player client api to cloudflare
or i could host with pythonanywhere
but that costs moneys
or Heroku
or Google AppEngine
also its WSGI so like
yes its a server
but it is shared
it just calls my WSGI app
pythonanywhere was nice
but they wont let me add a custom domain
so no
^^ free‚•πdepedency hell‚•πRust‚•πwhat is it with girls and an obsession with celebrities
cant they be obsessed with people in their school instead
like normal people‚•πso you want

did I ever say ¬´ me ¬ª anywhere‚•πi am making inferences‚•πwell
i never said such an thing
hence
no inference should be made‚•πthis may be useful
using cloud service providers

or anything but windows 8
so all you have to do is connect a mac
but its a foretaste
or clogged
Prior to our pickup
because
TTYTh
but among these things i look at
I have a question
and changing
i did
i think it does that
i will send one later
in the way that if you have your phone you can just get them to work even if they're not charged
and
um
ok so what if only u pirate somthing
its being a bad
that have no alternate functions
i find it very distrating and disruptive
what have you found‚•πlol
except now
i think we are dead‚•πOr you buy one
not me
You just shift your hands on the keyboard
my house doesn't have ethernet‚•πnope‚•πWhy
did I write
a romance novel
for 138 pages‚•πnope
dead
again‚•πHomeWork
no rn its doing weird flask stuff
I told my parents it was in Brooklyn
censorship is bad
and they were literally on my street
i know your path
mine doesn't run
if i bought it from you
no dont do it now
acting like I was some criminal
No the theme
I send a link
my grandparents apartment has many of those
i may write my first article as a poem
Well what is moving on the screen
hold on
i should get another monitor
its some child account
cool then that's fine
a paraprosdokian
and I didnt have much time to work on this stuff
and for $49
so idk if it even goes to me
well i never really planned to
Then give the website a nice icon
*weep
I can never get Linux to work for me
that's not a UI font
i think its just a coincidence though
what u wanna giv to me?
i tried already
you dont know
But typing is fast
I will test it when I get home
Then don't worry
I cannot at the moment
lemme do that
i came up with the path /beluga/passion
and unlike hackathons

Asking for your support‚•πno i already paid you
2 thousand dollars
now go win an election
you dont need my help anymore‚•πaw‚•πah‚•πi should be able to make a share‚•πthat should be a thing‚•πreally easily‚•πthe problem is
you need
to be
logged in‚•πmake the bot
associate my username
with my apikey‚•πyou dont have an apikey tho
i would have to make an api‚•πyou could like
mbed
the bot in the
flask app‚•πi mean
i could also just like
add an api‚•πhave fun
that is a nightmare‚•πor is it
all it needs to do
is export a session key
so you make a page
to get an api key
or a
"session" key
then pass it to the bot
actually
this might be a fun idea
the only issue
is it requires
the bot
to remember
things‚•πi was reading a book last night
it made me start sobbing‚•πi see‚•πliteralyl‚•πalternatively
the bot could make
"public shares"
that everyone can view
in fact any time it finds a YouTube link
it could automatically spit out a playtools link
but that would just start taking unneccesary space in my db
so probably no
what would it even do tho
just like
like you do
i know
what it could do
the bot
has an account
and
it can spit out data
hi i just made
an api
im sure ramesh
is happy to hear
and now
i can implement it‚•πAPIs are bad
hard to write‚•πi just wrote it
its very simple‚•πshow kode‚•πits almost no code‚•πi want see‚•πcuz its just the original code
wdym
show code‚•πapi code
yes
the route handler
function‚•πit uses
the same
handlers
as the non-api
except
for the sign in
which uses a different handler
essentially
when you sign in‚•πhow many lines of repeated code‚•πum
lemme count
this is all a repeat of the signin function
but that's it‚•πoh fine‚•πit relies on the "api" flag set by this function
in your session cookie
so when you ask it for data
it knows whether to respond in plain text
or in html‚•πwhat about
json‚•πwell
json
but
essentially
text
i mean
yea
json
actually
it is not json yet
i just used the str() method
i will use the json method
haha yes this is working‚•πyou should like
implement bot tokens‚•πi could
but‚•πit's a lot of work‚•πyes
it is
and
its not worth it
if you wanna embed video view data into chatbots‚•πand have a UI‚•πthey can just make their own accounts
so what you do‚•πwith zero lines of js‚•πyes
vanilla
css
not
javascript
and jquery
and all that‚•πyes zero lines
of js
zero
but I will add turbolinks‚•πhas some js now‚•πyou should add turbolinks‚•πfor an animation
look at the animation‚•πyes
j'ai vu‚•πi like that animation
its nice
i just made it a function‚•πmhm‚•πso i can apply it to any element
typeAnimate(<elementID>, time)
yes
that is similar
but the other implementation
where it repeats
this is just a simple animation
once

Tell me once you did‚•πi kinda cant do that rn‚•πWhy‚•πim more focused on the router‚•πAh
Is optimum there‚•πi dont need them to come just yet‚•πHave you found any leads
To this issue‚•πnope
not a clue‚•πDid you try connecting directly‚•πyea
i didnt work‚•πUm
Does your router have
Wait
It may have a serial terminal

or ssh
or telnet
i tried them‚•πYeah‚•πi could not connect‚•πCan you send a pic of the device‚•πbut it was refusal
so mabye
i just got the credentials wrong‚•πLike all the ports on the back‚•πthe ports?‚•πJust a picture of it
So I can see‚•πyea i will when i go downstairs‚•πK‚•πrn im doing support‚•πK‚•πok this support person is super annoying
i think i stumped them
cause they asked what i would like changed in the settings
which is not what i asked for
Hold up‚•πwait akhil‚•πdo i have to ask them every time i want things to be changed?‚•πi dont think so

r they accurate compared to my retina display
no‚•πi mean i have my dell SE2419H
and its really nice
but the colors
and the blacks
are not‚•πmine was on sale
for like 100 something
when its msrp was 200 something‚•πi mean im thinking of getting some dell ultrasharp

i like dell stuff‚•πu can find mine on their website'‚•πit usually is not garbage‚•πyea mine 2560x1440p
70hz‚•πi see‚•πi like mine cause it has a USB-C hub
so it connects to my mac with usb c‚•πYeah I don't need that‚•πcharges it‚•πAt all
It's going on a desktop‚•πand has 2 usb ports
yea then dont get this one

There is only one u should get

the telegram api‚•πhow does that work tho
polling?
websockets?‚•πpolling probably
it works though
like
i never use web services‚•πramesh
make a bot
someone other than me
make a bot
please‚•πI did
please
try
using this library
port your bot to it‚•πhow do i use your bot‚•πit is down‚•πmake it up‚•πit doesn't do anything‚•πmake it up all the time
make it respond to like
no‚•πhi
see
k fine‚•πk now
lets see
if this remains working
also
you can just make a bot
and link it to my webhook
and everything will work‚•πl8r‚•πmake a bot
and link it to my webhook‚•πI am sleeping‚•π*sigh‚•πohay≈ç
can you try destroying my bot cy
crashed bot‚•πbot is dead?
hmm‚•πalways crashing‚•πis it actually tho‚•π100% of the time
a
yep
it is dead‚•πrestart
it‚•πas a doornail
nope
i am restarting it‚•π/
r/
/
r‚•πit wont start cy‚•πramesh
why
wont it start
i dont get this
i can just like
make a bot
and it will work
in this group
maybe it needs admin
hol on
/
.s
my bot
will not
work
why
why
why
ramesh
i made a new group‚•πoh right
cy‚•πgo to the other chat‚•πexcept the one that works‚•πyou mean yours‚•πtyes
and like
the other clone of your bot‚•πso both mine‚•πno
the like
this
this
add definitely not cy ii
and give access to message
s
hi‚•πwhat is this literal horse crap‚•πstop using webhooks‚•πwhats weird is this
i get like
every 5-60 seconds
some message with
a slash
and it invokes an error
normally
its not that‚•πhmm‚•πalso
it doenst just like
come in
with every message‚•πwait I have an idea‚•πor even every /‚•πwait
remove the handlers‚•πwdym‚•πjust make it return no response
it has to process the incoming messages
without throwing errors
like the issue is‚•πoh you mean‚•πtelegram will keep spamming bad messages‚•πtelegram‚•πand then the bot will get confused‚•πdoesn't accept error 500‚•πeven if the message
has passed
yes
make it return something else‚•πk hold on
message
nope
its not
coming in
telegram will not send
anything
to my bot
WAIT
no
wait
wait
its coming in
all the messages
see now
im getting a flood
of messages‚•πsee
see‚•πhi ramesh
Aktchulee
I see
are for YouTube ad placement
that does not force me to agree with them
i found this
No
I think so too
If it was the second
cdknight: no
cdknight: k fine
that is interesting
its literally a laptop
even though my dad said he would pay half price
he will likely be more lost than you
i have to wait till like next year
she described it as as if a hurricane had come through
i guess
sorry $700‚•πcy did you disable error 500‚•πbc the software i was using required Nvidia CUDA‚•πno‚•πcdknight: this‚•πi just‚•πum‚•πno stop‚•πwell idk but often installing software becomes very weird
i need more friends to talk to
Cool
yes you can
and now its cheese
cdknight: see‚•πhi‚•πcdknight: hi
but in the end its not all that much money
hey ramesh
yeah im right i checked
thats too expensive
you should figure out how to run linux on a surface RT
okay
i had to like
 run ethernet through the walls
 to get to the furnace room
 but like coincidentally
 the router is right on the other side of the wall
 and coincidentally
 there is a hole
 in the wall
 just big enough for 2 ethernet cables
 so i ran
 the 2 ethernet cables
 and now
 it is on ethernet‚•πsee now it will work for a short time‚•πyes

he could even
make them‚•πwell in that case
I have one requirement
0 lines of JS‚•πi mean‚•πso no animations
you can use css
for animations‚•πi can get around

obviously i need it
for chat‚•πactually‚•πand radio‚•πmake it functional without js

it can work with js‚•πso like
if you disable js

an inordinate amount of time
to resize gifs‚•πjust use one of google's hundred or so tools‚•πno‚•πim sure
theres like‚•πI don't
use google tools‚•πsome image management tool‚•πand cloud services‚•πbut its more scalable‚•πidc‚•πhow do i run the app‚•πit is
painful to set up‚•πcan i just rewrite it
ill just write enough of it to make it appear‚•πno
you cannot rewrite it‚•πwhy‚•πI spent time on this project so I do not want my project to get thrown out
It would hurt my ego‚•πno like just enough flask to make it appear
so i can make the ui‚•πoh

run it
go to your wsl
and then
clone it
and then
follow the prompts
then
then
go to the directory‚•πum‚•πfor the repo‚•πi dont think

sudo service redis-server start‚•πk i think
everything
hold on
hi ramesh
this is
beautiful‚•πdid you celery‚•πyes‚•πrestart your flask‚•πand it was only yellow‚•πthe resize function broke probably
you have to obliterate the database‚•πactually
theres
an error‚•πoh
i hate this
right
you need to
install git-lfs
and then run like
git lfs pull‚•πin the directory?‚•πyes
in emotes‚•πrestart flask?
hi ramesh
it still
doesn't work‚•πwhat
oh
this you have to go into the database
just like‚•πwait
should i stop flask‚•πyes

and they are no longer stored in plaintext‚•πcy is having fun
the icons

you may have to git pull or else the PR will fail‚•πalso tho
it relies on cy2 basicstyle.css
also i have no clue how to use git correctly‚•πthat is a big problem‚•πik i can do git pull
to update‚•πthis may also be an issue‚•πthen git commit‚•πactually
nah
it's fine‚•πthe thing is
that file is
unstable
so you may wanna download it‚•πare you pulling it
from a remote server‚•πand host it yourself‚•πjust‚•πyes‚•πput it

idk what the credentials are tho‚•πmetasploit tiem‚•πcy mind running ip -c a on ur rpi
i kinda messed up my wpa_supplicant.conf on it

and send it‚•πk one moment‚•πgracias‚•πwhat about that machine id
its just
i wanted to see how different systems do it‚•πwhy
what is this‚•πits like weird
u should look up how its generated‚•πand python
and one is magenta
It's gonna be like 250
and it will also be secured
and i plan to wait
i wanna do split digital audio AI‚•πit work?‚•πyes‚•πhola‚•πHA

go to the other
chat‚•πi broke
it
on
the
dms‚•πconspiracy
akhil
is the death
of all bots‚•πmabye i just wont ask the bot
people will have to ask for me‚•πperhaps
wait
yeah I mean
well
cuz
when I dm it
it works
fine‚•πdo raspberry pis use cgroups‚•πidk‚•π/proc/self/cgroup
does it have something
after the first line
like whats the first line
that tells what cgroups it uses
arch has cgroups
ur supposed to cat it
its a file
hmm
interesting
so only arch has that‚•πsince it was on the bottom handle
anyway i dont need a new phone right now
I see no confetti
1gb is not much
CARRIAGE RETURN
Also I dont like the font
i am not COVID-19 research‚•πYES‚•πhe understands japanese‚•πi fixed
it
i figured out the problem‚•πhook up an si7021
I do not have a passport
bc i didn't know what to do‚•πthe problem was this
you would send a message
python would throw an error
and so the WSGI server would return an error 500
and then
telegram would be like
oh
you didn't acknowledge my message
ill send it again
and then
it would crash again
and the cycle would repeat
until a certain number of tries was exceeded
so now
if the code fails
it just
still returns
200 OK
*sigh‚•πSo‚•πhe had to go to hospital
what would  be interesting is to run android apps through chrome
i am awaiting my mom's completion of my school forms‚•πHola‚•πthen what
but honestly for applications that small
i utilize obs
the code that does airtable?‚•πNice‚•πsee you are a literal virus
but now
it doesn't die
when viruses like you
send messages
to the server
wait
try
something
other than hola‚•π„Åä„ÅØ„Çà„ÅÜ‚•πhmm‚•πNot as much
Calum did‚•π„Åä„ÅØ„Çà„ÅÜ‚•πcyfinfaza: Good morning‚•πidk
at least
it doesn't break now
eating food
bye
wait actually i wanna switch it back
hold on
wait i think my webhook is broken‚•πI guess i am‚•πbc my desktop does not accept mic signal from my earbuds
thats like the only thing i can say i would buy
anyway maybe ill do ionic
I have multiple Cortex M4 dev boards
i am also an e-reader
what if |
are they in telecom or pharma
I see
why
and you have had robots.txt issues with cloudflare
Or fusion 360 through wine
think about it
youre putting too much emphasis in
you want switches
so if u have questchin
cy is going to do some PCB design‚•πther
gud‚•πAdios
Ugh‚•πyup
nope‚•πWhy‚•πi will identify that issue
another time
i will eat
now
bye‚•πMust my life be like this
Cya‚•πcy filled his humidifier‚•π*clapping‚•π*sigh
time to read
and find sources‚•πNice
I gave up on english and just turned it in
She cant blame me‚•πi suppose
akhil
you can paste a YouTube link
try that
see if the bot dies
ah youre on mobile tho‚•πWhats command?‚•πno command
just paste link
ah yes
it needs to be
youtube desktop
not mobile‚•πlemme go find the linl‚•πit needs to have the watch?v=‚•πNo data yet.‚•πakhil click the thing to get data‚•πNo data yet.‚•πakhil

i could read
but i havent yet‚•πNice one‚•πtake a look
huh
its like
you have no

Thats cause i dont
Have
One‚•πget a username

i could just
add a condition
for that‚•πWait
Èù¢ÁôΩ„ÅÑ‚•πakhilvanka: interesting‚•πI
Did
It
I
Can
Fricken
Translate‚•πshoot
my database
my page just refreshed
5 thousand times
bugs
i hate bugs
now is not the time to fix those bugs
now is the time
to become
interested
in capitol punishment
and its merits
and downfalls
and the varying opinions
of various credible
peer-reviewed
sources‚•πYes‚•πwait akhil
did you see
it has a new front page‚•πOo fancy‚•πMy design
i designed
i am now a collaborator
on the github
they pulsate
they glow‚•πNice
I should do something to become collaborator
They so blurry‚•πthey are meant for discord
to be inline‚•πAh makes sense‚•πyou know what i like about windows
just
you are more a software type
i dont let it steep for long enough
Do‚•πI need ramesh to make me a token for it‚•πbrew tea
They test things for safety
or asian
well what would be an equivalent amd‚•πsafety
or asian
one or the other‚•πtry this for your validation key
later
this is where it was the whole time
I'ma ask the gearbest people
see heres a problem
if i stay here any longer i will not sleep and i will fail at honors english
like if there is even 1 cm of water
ramesh where to get firmware
my relatives
Or 15 fps on mid color depth‚•πhahaha
one has to die
its gonna be 15 fps on mid color depth
or my relatives‚•πI could set up distributed data collection with them
This is another one
cuz i dont think chrome is made with .net
if I buy it as a student
it looks ugly‚•πwoba woba woba woba
heres a question
what if we made like
our own
messaging platform
that worked in the cli
like properly
like a cli messenger‚•πHmmm
That would be cool‚•πalso like
if its our own platform
it can be anything
and we dont have to worry
about anything
like it becoming subscription
or privacy
or any of that‚•πThats true
That would be a cool idea‚•πi see‚•πWhere would we store all the messages?‚•πon a server‚•πCloud?‚•πyeah
well it has to be cloud
or else
its bad‚•πYea
Time to see how to make a messaging protocol‚•πWebSockets
or actually
something like MQTT
like nochat
but obviously with more features
hmm
i will be looking into this‚•πemotes?
you want?
i give
Yes
I'm a Teapot‚•πim going to leave
i am going
to
become a MERN dev‚•πooo
fancy‚•πramesh
is mad
without being here‚•π?‚•πhe does not like
MERN
devs‚•πwell MERN are what, Mongo, and Fancy JS right?‚•πMongo ExpressJS React Nsomething
maybe nginx‚•πnode
right?‚•πyeah
see im not sure if I want all of it
on a more specific note
is a thing
im sure you are aware‚•πof course
react is nice‚•πits supposed to be difficult or something
but I examined the result
of the little example programs
and I liked
what I saw
so I wanna learn that
and it might
send me into MERN space
cuz like
idk
i had pe
she was like
you need to have all your workouts done
and i was like
wait
i thought
we were just coming up with them for wednesday
and shes like
no
you have to do them all
by wednesday‚•πhuh‚•πyou must be like
why does cy like this‚•πyes and no
i usually try to never question the things u send‚•πi see
but if you look in the image‚•πbut i cant help but siliently judge them‚•πyou see react
is by default
doing the right thing
and letting the app take up the top space
also
the buttons
are not some crap
they are good buttons
i have no problem using a safearea
if my app will look good
also its cross platform
which is what i need
so essentially
its better
than the other stuff
Xamarin was garbage
Flutter was ugly
Ionic is slow
this appears good
if you get what i mean‚•πit has been good
ive been using it for some smal things
and its nice
its just kinda annoying to set up‚•πima gota khem
bye‚•πwhy i cant access the settings
cause one, I can only edit the settings through optimum
and second
optimums router management thingy is down‚•πah‚•πso i gotta wait till they fix the dang thing‚•πima finish watching the planning thing‚•π?‚•πur supposed to watch
the vidoe‚•πYea imma watch it later‚•πimma watch it now
to get it out of the way‚•πUm
U got more ram didnt u‚•πthey were gone‚•πWhy r u still bottoming it out?‚•πand then
they came back‚•πAh okay‚•πyeah im not out rn
oh just streaming video
over WebSockets
to the folks out there
on optimum
you might wanna
switch
to
replit‚•πUh what
What
WHAT
Can i install openvpn on it‚•πi really wanted to
but why would that help you‚•πU prob can
I mean‚•πyou still have to tunnel through optimum‚•πIk
It speed tho‚•πyour speed would be limited by optimum‚•πI get 300 from optimum
So i would be fine‚•πi wanted OpenVPN on it tho so i could have shared networks
with ppl
so its not my home network
thing is tho
if u need to browse the web
in school
um
without blocks‚•πwait
repl it vpn‚•πyes
repl it vpn‚•πdoes it work‚•πor repl it proxy
replit hosting is real
i like replit‚•πI need to do stuff‚•πk
wait
raspberry pi
made their own
arm chip
Spotify¬Æ
WebSockets
i like to snoop
on what sites are doing
over websockets
spotify is playing ping pong
gravity must be really weak tho
cuz it takes the ball 30 seconds
to get from one side to the other
name me a website
that has like
interactive
live content‚•πI did things‚•πramesh
have you heard of
Redis‚•πYes
I took your files and did stuff to it‚•π?‚•πthis one
try figuring out what this odes‚•πThat means u r very wrong
Beyond tangible‚•πxplain wtf this question means
plz
wait
i might have got it‚•πHow many electrons
Can it hold
In said quantum number‚•πso like
2 per orbital
and then‚•πNo‚•πthat * num orbitals
* num sublevels‚•π2 for the first orbital‚•πno
its 2 for all orbitals
wait
no
its 2
for s orbitals
ooh unigram has a pulsing dot now‚•πIdk why it was doing that‚•πnow hold on‚•πUr off by 4 I think‚•πif n = 1‚•πFirst ones 18‚•πthen
its 2
if n = 2
then its 10‚•πBruh
Its just 2n^2 i think
Use that formula‚•πum‚•πMight be 2n^3‚•πwhy tho
i need to know
i will derive the formula
good bye
ah
i think
i might get it‚•π?
Why do u have a picture of orbitals?‚•π2(n-1)^2‚•π2n^2‚•πah yes‚•πU dont need an n-1‚•πthat is
correct
what
is this
each orbital
has 2 electrons
arsenic has 33 electrons‚•πNot electrons
How many orbitals‚•πyes
but
if i have 32 electrons
i will fill 16 orbitals
completely
and thus have 17
if i have 33‚•πIts 18 total
15 full
Remember‚•πoh wait
cuz‚•πU gotta have one electron in each orbital
First‚•πyeah
oops‚•πThen u can fill em up
Also idk how u got the last one wrong
N=4 means 4‚•πum
no‚•πU can le check
Its 4‚•πbut imagine it were like Gallium
then the n = 4 would only be 2‚•πWould it‚•πyes‚•πIdk bout gallium‚•πwell for arsenic
its 4
but if the question asked for anything less than arsenic
it would not be 4
not this
the hell is this
if theyre blank
theyre blank
why
*sigh
done
with
that‚•πIdk
Good job‚•πmight as well do 6.4 whilst im here‚•πThe next one is also kinda annoying
Cause there is a 24 point tutorial
That normally takes forever‚•π?‚•πThe lewis dot structure one
For us it was a webassign
And to draw
U needed to use MarvinJS‚•πhmm‚•πAnd there was a 24 part tutorial
On how to use MarvinJS
That u couldnt skip
It took longer than the actual webassign‚•πwait
i see it
hmm‚•πDont press skip‚•πwhy‚•πNo matter what u do
It doesnt give u points‚•π*sigh‚•πSo ur gonna end up with a 24 point gap‚•πhi akhil
i did it
with no
tutorials‚•πNice
We had one‚•πmy faithful space heater
has just
stopped
working
you turn it on
and it does not do
anything
the light comes on
and that's it
oh just making a mood board
for French class

thanks to Ramesh for telling me that was a thing
i like how windows
thinks edge
is malware
i try to launch edge
and it triggers antimalware service execuatable
taking like 25%
of my 6 core desktop CPU
to stop Edge
and then it proceeds to slow it down
and prevents it from working
Microsoft needs to fix this
Stupid fuse
Why‚•πcy is malware‚•πcyware

*sigh
but mine will follow a few guidelines
but since unigram is uwp it works nicely on windows
when its done
ok
i see
look i have antennas coming in the mail tmrw
it is too expensive and time consuming
from where to where
I could come over to your house and help you at some point

dont make ur domain
some like
set of random characters
cuz then
no one will remember
it has to be memorable‚•πfine‚•πis better
than
sure
tell me a site
that you do not think
will lead
to twitter help‚•πuhm
uhmmm‚•πyeah no
that one
led to twitter help‚•πWhy r u trying to find 6 letter domains?‚•πcuz imma start there
well actually
i paused
that
and now i am working on my tree crawler
which works
but
its really slow‚•πBut why this?‚•πwhat else should i do
7 letter domains?‚•πNo‚•πmy list of 6 letter domains
is 6GB‚•πBut why so specific‚•πcuz if i did 7
it would like
be bad
too big‚•πU know what sure‚•πtoo long
i wanna ask myself
how
leads
here‚•πhow‚•πi think
every time
it goes to that page
it finds another
%Bamp
and adds it on
cuz
now its
here‚•πI can get a domain
I have a dollar
what do I get
idk
which one to choose
leam is like gleam‚•πthats not bad
ahhhhhhh
my lunch pd changes‚•πwdym really
do you know what lazy static is‚•πyea i go from pd 8 to 6
nope‚•πOoof
Mine is 5
wait
SIX?
buddy‚•π5‚•πok good
i have apcs then
but it's actually my lunch period‚•π?‚•πapcs
period 5
but it's much lunch period
cy would be in accordance‚•πhuh‚•πhe is in
our apcs class‚•πto "help"
except I can barely help people when people are utilizing hammers‚•πNice one‚•πalthough I do help sometimes
dont u just love when the error count keeps going down by one‚•πNah
i like when it goes up‚•πsmh
how‚•πwhen u didnt change anything‚•πwhy
HAH‚•πWait no
the best
is when u have a ton of errors
and u dont change anything
and they all go away‚•πyes
but how does that even happen‚•πfor me‚•πhow‚•πits whenever I use the wrong compiler‚•πalso guys
you should try zig
it's another programming language
I wanna try go
it's supposed to be really fast to develop working stuff
which is appealing‚•πIll compile C using a python interperter
yea
its kinda annoying‚•πbut rust is just like really good
what
accident
why
i also am not setting up gitlab
im doing gitea
wait‚•πwhy would u set up gitlab?‚•πmemory hog
i like this domain name
a lot‚•πthats \
not bad‚•πyeah‚•πcause its is ‚Äúspeakable‚Äù
idk what the word is‚•πI really like minimalistic titles‚•πU can say it‚•πbut now I can do‚•πum why?‚•πwdym
that was what I chose‚•πi dont set it as a subdomain‚•πI do
I have multiple services‚•πpihole would be‚•πno ew
ew
no
subdomains r cool‚•πimma steal the domain‚•πhow‚•πdont do namecheap‚•πi wont
im using the one on tld-list‚•πporkbun
its 1.01 first year
but renews for 9$
um wut‚•πsyll is an SA reference
swyl is a corruption of an SA reference‚•πboth sound fine
dont add a number‚•πyeah
idk how I feel about xyz
but it is cheap‚•πyea 0.59
but then it goes to 8$‚•πI want 3 letters but I'd go with this
I will transfer it‚•πfor something else
thats expensive
.com is cheaper‚•πyeah but i only have a dollar to buy‚•πhmmmmm
i would get either‚•πugh‚•πboth are fine‚•πidk i want something tea-related maybe‚•πporkwa?‚•πidk
ooooh akhil knows french‚•πi do?‚•πporkwa

Baguette‚•πignore this
diesel overwrites my custom schema‚•πvin diesel?‚•πno
cygh
I love lazy_static‚•πonly 422 of them
are /r/ pages
indexing the web is kinda fun‚•πwhy
r
u
indexing
the
web
?
dont be google‚•πcuz its fun
you just give it an entry point
and it like
finds
i have not given it Wikipedia yet
but there wouldnt be much point
since like
wikipedia you can already download the entire index‚•πdont‚•πit runs pretty fast
it runs 500 workers
concurrently
there is a lot of memory overlap
and it cannot count
but
in the end
there are not too many duplicates
^^ it trying to count how many pages it has seen
its fast tho
ideally it would be running on an actual db
and it would be distributed
so like
we could all run an instance of it
it gets approximately 33 results per second
wait
no
probably more
idk‚•πWide cy?‚•πi have been working on pe
for too long
this
shall end
this
must
end‚•πHuh?
Why‚•π*sigh
im like
in that state
where
i should have done work earlier
but i didnt‚•πHuh
U should have
But u didnt
Instead u started indexing the internet‚•πyes
i will now go do work
bye‚•πI should start doing this PE thing
I want to do it tomorrow
it's due on thursday
i think I might have found my domain
could be fun
IVT MVT Rolle's
Hmm
thonking
idk‚•πtime to call linus
"the 10 exabyte project"‚•πOh are you reading about the xkcd guy‚•πno
remember
im trying
to index the entire internet‚•πThat is randall munroe
Xkcd guy‚•πwell
i set
as an entry point
for my crawler‚•πTry the blog‚•πit broke my crawler‚•πHow‚•πit thought
you owned
twitter‚•π...‚•πand then
it just like
slowed down
i need to work on that crawler‚•πHow does twitter
Like my website does not link to twitter‚•πyour website
does
link
to twitter
like all sites‚•πNo‚•πthe issue i believe
is in passing the root
and then
it finds an external link
but
leaves
the root
while crawling that external link
so then
all internal links on that page
its a really badly written program
ima make one that uses an actual database
and it sort of
figures everything out
on its own
that way
you can like
run an instance
of my crawler
anyone
can crawl
for me
and watch
for their enjoyment
where the crawler is
i just need a 10 exabyte database‚•πYes
Or‚•πits like FaH‚•πZlib compression‚•πbut its CaH
Crawling at home
you set an entry point
and then
crawl it
and then it marks things as done in the db
so that crawlers know where to go‚•πUm
Cy at Home
Also RiiR
Rewrite it in Rust‚•πno
it will remain
python‚•πNo
Rust fast
Rust threading good
Think about this‚•πI'ma learn abuncha languages‚•πYou have two threads
K
Then one thread modifies thr data
While the other is in the middle of modifying it as well
Rip data‚•πYes‚•πRust does not let you‚•πCounting fun‚•πAccidentally modify your data
Mutex or it wont compile‚•πIsn't this called memory safety‚•πNo
Maybe a bit
Memory safety is if you like
Free a pointer and then use it again
Also i sleep bye‚•πGn‚•πRust also doesnt let you free pointers
Like that
The pointer goes out of scope
Also idk if it's a pointer
It is an object on the stack
To alloc on the heap you use a box‚•πGn‚•πThey did it
They won the fricken courtcase‚•πYES
how to use cycss
cy2basicstyle.css

RaemeshCSS
ill keep the ae‚•πi mean
but that uses a css class
its spelled wrong‚•πoh
bluetiful‚•πbest button
in whole world‚•πi updated this page
so now
it does not use a class‚•πprice vs quantity graph, the green line by me is apple‚•πYes‚•πwhat
uh
cy have fun on your apcs quiz
bye
i get to program now‚•πyes.
One UI 3 is mine.‚•π11?
11?‚•πyes‚•πnice‚•πi will also get an update to 12
since samsung extended to 3 generations rather than 2‚•πUgh
I will only get up to 11
And I haven't gotten 11 yet
I don't know whether or not I should custom ROM‚•πbtw
the mi a3
had 11
a long time ago
i may purchase another Android One device
jestchers look nicir‚•πwhy is .xyz sketchy
I really dislike that people find it this way
since I cannot afford a .me‚•πNew media experience‚•πI use both keyboards
maybe it's not
and i plan to wait‚•πB
Battery Life ‚Ñ¢‚•πso if I go to school
I would see you‚•πyes‚•πshould I come to school then‚•πyes‚•πI want to
how much
do you have to use zoom in school
since I hate zoom‚•πevery period
almost‚•πsee that is the problem‚•πyes‚•πmy
lunix zoom
broaks‚•πi use my phone
for zoom
in school‚•πHmm
work profile‚•πyes
work profile‚•πI must think further on this‚•πthe thing is this
its the social aspect‚•πyes ik
i hate sitting at home‚•πso if your friends are in school‚•πit makes me sad‚•πlike
it is nice‚•πyes‚•πbut if they all leave
then‚•πbut what about the‚•πits unfun‚•πhealth aspect‚•πyes that too
coronavirus
but also‚•πi am at higher risk than you maybe‚•πgetting up and moving around‚•πi have immune system problems‚•πi see‚•πso
that is the concern‚•πyes
thing is this
i am on the line between going and not
i am going rn
but
like
i only see akash
and like sam and matthew period 6‚•πand if I came‚•πif you came
we could walk home
ensemble‚•πyes
that could be fun
the thing is I am really paranoid
at home‚•πabout what‚•πabout like
sanitation
because of covid‚•πi mean
i can tell you
they all wear masks
and clean all the desks‚•πwhat if
I wanna drink water‚•πbring a bottle‚•πwith a straw‚•πwhat‚•πput it under your mask‚•πoh
no you can take off the mask for like
a second
or just pull it down enough
to drink
or like some ppl
you can go to the corner of the room‚•πmy parents said I could go MP4
so I might do that‚•πI see‚•πthey did not say I could go
they said I should go‚•πhmm
i see‚•πyes
so
idk
the thing is I really don't like home‚•πi see
i mean i imagine it gets really boring and stagnant after a while
to just stay there all the time‚•πyes
like
it saps my energy
to sit on zoom
the entire day‚•πtbh i dont have much of a problem at home
one of the things i like at school tho
is like
i am very social with the teachers‚•πyeah
I can do that too‚•πand its much easier to socialize with them
there‚•πand insult my government teacher more
which I want to
do‚•πi can talk to mrs harding after school‚•πyes
this is a thing‚•πi can fix mrs tan's time
i can show ms baker how to use onenote
i can show Mr Y my app‚•πExactly‚•πI can locate mr Harvey and discuss
the musical‚•πhow about the meetings
no
i mean the classes
like is it bad in class‚•πeducationally speaking‚•πsince the teacher is like staring into the screen instead of at the in-class students‚•πyeah
it depends on the teacher
some pay more attention to zoom
others really long teaching to a class
and so
they focus more on the class
in school‚•πHmm
Interesting
I have to consider‚•πthe thing is‚•πOn one hand it will probably make my life better if I go to school
But I might die‚•πmoving from dual displays
to like
a phone
and a laptop‚•πYeah I know‚•πi doubt it
its not very much in schools
also
the teachers are getting vaccinated
like probably this MP
so if ur doing MP4
then‚•πuhm
hmm‚•πthey will probably start vaccinating children by then‚•πi wanna go before everyone else goes tho‚•πyou wanna see the empty school‚•πand the few people there
such as you‚•πyes‚•πat the same time
if it is so empty
theres like
much lower chance‚•πidk the reports say
very little cases in school‚•πhave there been actual cases‚•πthere have been cases
of course
but
not many
i mean it is a pandemic-level virus‚•πyes‚•πso there will be spreading‚•πHmm
It is risky‚•πtbh as a student
i would not be too concerned
unless you have serious underlying conditions‚•πdo people follow social distancing‚•πmostly‚•πcygh
idk‚•πalthough
its more like
there has to be some implicit consent
so like
if you back away from people
when they approach you
then
they will cease approaching you‚•πI do this
some people do not respect it‚•πok but its a pandemic
you gotta do
what you gotta do‚•πyes
it is a pandemic
I dunno
I have to think
someone make a telegram bot
that integrates into emotes‚•πwhat
would it do‚•πno‚•πbut then
like
wait‚•πit could add sticker packs‚•πso it just appends like
i dont think bots can do that‚•πmaybe
idk‚•πi mean
i could make a bot
that like
becomes‚•πyeah but the issue is it shows up as from someone else‚•πi could do that in like
2 minutes
true‚•π*cygh
theme
good night
if there are too many
So you will need to use conventional methods or your system
that could be a motorola‚•πth√®me
th√®se‚•πykow
theres this
bing image bot‚•πhow does it work‚•πhere lemme make a recording‚•πk
how does that work
that works‚•πi think its called an inline bot‚•πhow hard is it to make one‚•πidk ill read the api docs
and try to make one‚•πlike this
does it work for like
pngs‚•πtf is this game
its like
2048
but with cities
btw
gamepidgeon
telegram
that‚•πvia bold‚•πaw
no‚•πthis is what you want
make all of them stickers
idk‚•πhmm‚•πhuh
how to send pngs
thats no fun
basically it needs to become a webp‚•πthen
make alla them webps‚•πi can do that on my side
it will just be like
storage waste‚•πcy is going to work on this inline thing
is a thing‚•πI can send webps
and they turn into stickers
voila
so then you just need emotesbot to convrt to webp‚•πfirst
lemme
just
make
an inline bot‚•πHmm
It has to be a specific size which is problematic
you could wrap a huge box around
Hmm
No I don't like it‚•πAh
Ngrok
Bueno‚•πyeah
duh ngrok
so I need to compress it and add
this is gonna be fun
and complex
I would like the bot to do this
or not‚•π*sigh
its not
working‚•πhere
its not in here‚•πI would use voir
then yea
on ebay
*cough until your camera doesn't work
so he will leave
4GB ram
why does it work for you
it can be done anywhere
so it only enables gps when the user wants location data
don't worry you should soon grow out of that
but these are all problems that can be solved
can you send me the current names data
they make important decisions
a telegraph is 20 bits per second‚•πwait‚•πVhat‚•πI may try a webhook bot
rocket or actix tho‚•πI mean u dislike rocket‚•πno
some random person told me
"heHOO rocket bad"‚•πRocket es bueno
Its the most popular one‚•πidk actix seems annoying‚•πHola
Um what‚•πbecause anyone who "hates"
no
telepresence‚•πHola‚•πemotes bot for telegram is gonna be great‚•πYes
Hola‚•πakhilvanka: Hello‚•πFinally
Tf was it doing‚•πcdknight: Tf was it doing‚•πCy is cool‚•πakhilvanka: Ramesh is cool‚•πRamesh is cool‚•πcdknight: Ramesh is cool
akhilvanka: Ramesh‚•πC‚Äî‚Äåy‚•πakhilvanka: C ‚Äî ‚Äåy‚•πAdd a weird space in between
The soft space‚•πwait
i got it
C¬≠y is cool‚•πcdknight: C¬≠y is cool‚•πthere‚•πYes‚•πakhilvanka: Haha i can C¬≠y now‚•πyes‚•πWait for certbot u have to run it on ur machine right?
And the ports have to be open‚•πno
not if you use
webroot‚•πWhats that?‚•πyes
it works
my bot
works
and then space
and then
a query
and you will get
moose
or whatever that animal is
10x Moose
someone send the moose
so i see its working
ah yes
yes
indeed
yes
so now
i just implement emotes‚•πit rejects
my thing
card
so ill ask my parents to buy it‚•πramesh‚•πoof‚•πsend moose‚•πor I can just go to namecheap and buy it and use all the money on the card
which is a no‚•πno‚•πsendamoose‚•πnamecheap is bad imo‚•πno‚•πit has a good interface
but is kinda expensive‚•πthen click a result‚•πi hate gym‚•πramesh
it works in here‚•πyes
who doesnt‚•πit works everywhere‚•πthis question is dumb‚•πit is
if i had a million dollars id invest it
to make another million‚•πthats also what id do
cy
what does the inline bot code look like
it requires complex webp manipulation that needs to happen telegram bot-side
I can write that code if you want‚•πthe bot
now
sort of‚•πyou need‚•πramesh‚•πto convert it to a webp
somehow‚•πsend
an emote
through
the bot
ok so essentially do this
on your server
just store
both this version
and a webp version
of the right size
then also‚•πno
you can do that part‚•πadd a search function‚•πthat exists‚•πi store the webp version‚•πin the api
you need an api key‚•πPaste a valid YouTube link to create an in-group PlayTools share.‚•πidfk why tf u need a fin api key
thats dumb‚•πHmm?
Fin api key?‚•πf-in‚•πAh
Idk api keys r kinda useless‚•πwhy‚•πCause someone can brute force it‚•πnot easily‚•πDepends‚•πyou can make a Rust client for PlayTools‚•πIts its number yes‚•πPlayTools has an API‚•πIf its letter and number kinda
If its ascii no‚•πdo u want one
an api key‚•πits also down
cuz its not a thing yet‚•πwate
i gave you an api key cy
just go
you can also search‚•πdoes this like store a session key‚•πno
you have to implement the searching yourself
sorry
but it gives a list of all of them‚•πwait
lemme
just
hold on‚•πthis is the documentation‚•πwait‚•πfor the entire api‚•πbut then
i can only
search
global ones‚•πyou can also search non-global ones
namespaces are private‚•πbut‚•πbut‚•πi wanna search
your namespace‚•πif you are an admin
you can search any namespace‚•πi see‚•πactually no‚•πbut then the search is not that useful‚•πno it is useful
you can use it
you have to fetch a namespace‚•πhold on
how
do i search
the global namespace
like walk me through it‚•πthis
just replace that with your api key‚•πidk where it is‚•πuhm
does it work‚•πgimme moment‚•πthis is gonna be bad‚•πso it sorta works
if you @ the bot
it will bring up
all the global slugs
but its really slow‚•πnah
it's fine for me
no
is it supposed to search‚•πits supposed to
bring up the emote
if the slug you typed
exists‚•πok fine
that works
what about namespace support‚•πum
it cannot search namespaces‚•πit can‚•πit can however
check
if a slug
in a namespace
exists‚•πyes
it cannot list namespaces‚•πwhat is the api to see all things in a namespace‚•πin the api doc
but
with your api key‚•πgimme a namespace
not mine‚•πm
that's mine
I need to remove the path
there are no more paths‚•πhey ramesh
it works‚•πAfk‚•πhow do i list all namespaces‚•πYou don't‚•πk‚•πIntended behaviour
You search the namespace they provide‚•πhmm
wait‚•πYes‚•πwhere‚•πAh‚•πarma kaptions‚•πCat‚•πi want
my
kaptions‚•πMake it
Webp‚•πno like‚•π512x512‚•πi want it to show
the slug‚•πUse the name‚•πin the result‚•πNot the slug‚•πno
i want
the slug
so that they can type it
next time
or ideally both
but the thing isnt working
hold on
meh
it wont
work
but
you can
now do things‚•πYes it works‚•πnow do m/
and it will bring up
all of ramesh's‚•πHmm
Phone‚•πCy
Can u rename the bot‚•πyes‚•πIts a hassle to type‚•πi can
rename
it
no
it has to end in bot
and it cannot be
emotesbot
or emotebot
s
o
it is‚•πWhy not?‚•πemotesinlinebot
not available‚•πAh
Well make it something ez to type
Cause u cant do @ and have it pop up
I hate spotify
I dislike its mobile app
It doesnt work‚•πhold on
there
works now‚•πimma
make it like
webp
stickers
you can actually just like‚•πKwality‚•πnot kwality‚•πKook‚•πHAH‚•πBueno‚•πmmmeh‚•πonce you have the webps
gimme a ring‚•πit needs to be 512x512‚•πmake webps
you are already doing image resizing
make webps
i cannot do it inline
it would take too long‚•πfine‚•πnot in the sense that it would take me too long
but to resize images‚•πI can give you the code to resize‚•πin the middle of processing
an inline request‚•πfine‚•πwould mean
lag‚•πno you only have to resize it when sending
not while proecssing‚•πtrue
but still
cuz also
i reference the image with a URL
so i would have to 1.‚•πim seeing how annoying it will be‚•πdownload
2.
resize
3.
upload
4.
link‚•πit goes into the database
i have to like do weird stuff‚•πima eat a snack
then
ima do AP seminar‚•πThat is true
we will have to see
I see‚•πwait
this may not be so hard
256x256 has to do stuff
okay

cygh
hey cy
if you download images with ?tg=1 it will do it for telegram
btw imma disappear for the rest of the day so bye‚•πWhat ?

it loads forever‚•πit might take a hot second
since
I disabled caching
for development reasons‚•πloading‚•πno don't do that
that won't send
webps
for some reason
just like
mention the bot
then it brings up all the global ones
then select one‚•πstill loading
also cy
are you using a webhook‚•πyes‚•πthen
into the regular code‚•πsure
nrn tho‚•πYeah that's fine
but also the bot is dead‚•πum‚•πif i were you
ICU too‚•πit still no werk
let me try on the wack
oh i was using the wrong bot‚•πwhat‚•πnamespace n owrk‚•πmine is sorta working‚•πhmm

stop caching
cygh‚•πRamesh
2 hours and 30 minutes from now
Is 3:30‚•π?
hah.‚•πStacy's‚•πyes
but emotes
no
this
should render as transparent‚•πYes‚•πbut
it is cached‚•πNo
It's not‚•πit is cached‚•πI disabled caching‚•πhow are you sending the images
does it use a link
or a file‚•πUrl‚•πyes it is cached
add &v=5 to the response
and see what happens‚•πHold on
I'm on phone‚•πokay‚•πWhat url do I need‚•πthe old url‚•πFor photos‚•πand add the parameters
&v=5‚•πJust that
*sigh
apparently
this is not ok‚•πI think
you have to send a sticker‚•πsomething
is wrong with my json
hold on‚•πbut set the input_message_content
I uncached stuff‚•πwait
if you send
a link to a webp
does that act as a sticker‚•πyes but no
see
now if I download that and send it‚•πI see‚•πbut i know the bot can send it too somehow
see
via sticker‚•πyes
but
it has to
be a sticker‚•πmake the sticker‚•πon telegram's servers‚•πbut
there is an input_message_content‚•πhmm
wait‚•πalternatively u could send a file
idk how‚•πfirst lemme undie it
cuz its dead rn
after i literally changed like
nothing‚•πah yes the typical telegram bot
idk‚•πwait
i think
imma figure
it out‚•πah this bot is broken now
or i didnt add it‚•πits not
in the group‚•πima make an inline bot‚•πsomething with the &v=5
is erroring out‚•πremove it then‚•πthen it works
but it doesn't have the v=5
a wonderful
http GET request‚•πI agree
i
have to enable it
oh
it cant see messages
k i think i can do something
Something interesting goes here
Something interesting goes here
that's wrong
Something interesting goes here‚•πi dont think
an inline bot‚•πSomething interesting goes here‚•πcan send its own stickers‚•πim working on things‚•πor its own images
that would be stickers
ramesh
that is
a cached sticker
that is on their server‚•πyes
then you could upload stickers‚•πyou could do that
every time
someone creates an emote‚•πyes look I am working on a bot
why is the query caching
just to send stickers‚•πbut
you need to
upload
the stickers‚•πlet me see
I have some ideas
Now
Hmm‚•πik
how to do it
now‚•πhow‚•πessentially
you need to 1.‚•πyou send a message‚•πupload the sticker‚•πon behalf of them
uploading the image‚•π2.‚•πidk‚•πsend the cachedsticker id
so essentially
you need to upload stickers
when the person creates an emote
and add tg_stickerid to the database‚•πyes‚•πfor the emote‚•πuhm
surely there is an easier way‚•πno‚•πwait imma think more
just wait
k wait
now
uh
what i do is
k so
see this
when I upload thonk.webp
telegram turns that into a sticker
so what you have to do is figure out how on earth that is happening
so you upload a file
and then you get the id
and then you send the sticker
no backend involved
cy
smh‚•πwhere u find that‚•πthe telegram official api
so send as sticker
instead of picture
bot can send stuff like this‚•πbot can send stickers
but
not as inline‚•πyes it can‚•πno it cannot send a sticker‚•πYes it can‚•πon behalf of the user‚•πInlineQueryResultCachedSticker
let me implement it‚•πcached‚•πit can also send messages on behalf of the user
so‚•πbut only text messages‚•πlet me see
um‚•πi tell to you
that
the only way
is to first upload
then
send
as cached‚•πthen it gets complicated‚•πyes‚•πi have to modify the database a lot‚•πyes‚•πwhy couldnt they just
liek
not
hmm ramesh is going to think
see
this is a file id
so if I upload a FILE not a STICKER
it should still work‚•πit has to be the right type
like 512x512 png‚•πyes webp
if you do ?tg=1
it does that‚•πno‚•π512x512 png‚•πPNG‚•πit does
no webp works as well
im pretty sure
uhm
that's outdated
just wait
yes‚•πi want‚•πyou should do that‚•πto accept
payments‚•πDont‚•πwhere is the uploadFiles
now how do i upload a regular old file
for gods sake
cugh
imma
upload a sticker and see what happens
a
and it works.‚•πok...‚•πbut
now it's doing weird wack stuff‚•πi see‚•πlemme inviestigate
telegram says "sticker document invalid"
cuz it gotta be a png
still invalid‚•πi tried to send that cached sticker‚•πuhm
ramesh may be doing a dumb rn‚•πcy is cold
he wants his space heater‚•πmaybe‚•πand it doenst have that
that are aimed more at traditional puzzle solvers
like this news that
i just dont like the stability of linux
an immense, continuous fabric
Then how would it know whether or not there is a meeting on a particular day
imma try on my fone
why does it work for you‚•πthis is annoying
it should work
I actually like uploaded a 512x512 sticker‚•πbut it doesnt
ramesh
lets make
our own
chat platform‚•πmaybe
but not rn
I want to solve this
i am 100% sure it can work
{"ok"=>true, "result"=>{"file_id"=>"BQACAgEAAxUAAWATEHCoYyFJLFtRNDw7YnUVrSQzAAJrAQACjFaYRNMKuKoC3-l_HgQ", "file_unique_id"=>"AgADawEAAoxWmEQ", "file_size"=>50943}}
k it still no send sticker right
so‚•πHola‚•πkomp cy‚•πUh
Sure
One second
uh ill wait till we go to breakout rooms‚•πk‚•πidk
just go to 400
ill join you‚•πk‚•πoh no
kevin is here‚•πis fine‚•πlol‚•πwhy yall muted?‚•πmy microphone
is broken‚•πuse ur phone‚•πi also cant hear anyone
k i cant hear anyone
so you CAN send stickers
z
having fun?
HA
Edge lunix
1. Download webp
2. Generate random name for sticker set
3. Create new sticker set
4. Call get new sticker set
5. Get file id from sticker set
6. Send inline
Or

1. Get incoming inline request
2a. If namespace, get namespaced emotes ‚Üí get tg_file_id from image table and generate response
3a. If local, get tg_file_id from image table and generate response

When uploading: 
1. Resize emotes
2. Upload emote to namespace sticker pack.

When adding new global emotes:
1. Create a namespace row for global emotes
2. Set the sticker pack id there
3. Upload on request
why what is happening now‚•π5 to 100
*cough
It skyrocketed from 5$ a share to around 108$ a share‚•πtf
that's insane
sell now
it's in a bubble whatever that means‚•πNo mabye kinda
U dont want to sell now‚•πu do‚•πCause nobody ‚Äúbuys‚Äù shares‚•πjust take it and leave‚•πNo no no
So essentially
Gamestop is a shorted stock
Means people expect it to drop
So they ‚Äúborrow‚Äù a share
Sell it
Wait for it to drop
Buy it back
And return it
So
If u have a stock
And u didnt short it
U wanna hold onto the stock
For as long as possible
Cause anyone who shorts it needs to buy the stock‚•πI do not understand
but I will do so later
I have to study for APUSH‚•πYes‚•πI have a bunch of 8t
It
It was like my first shortsell in a while‚•πNice‚•πcy is still trying to make notifications work
essentially
you need like
RSA galore‚•πOh no‚•πyou need like
3 different keys
for like
encrypting
decrypting
signing
signature verification‚•πAh‚•πVAPID
gee that's nice to know
I dont want no dinosaurs with laser guns
YES.
YES.
IT WORKED.‚•πYay‚•πonly in firefox tho
now to see if itll work in krome‚•πThats a start‚•πit doesn't work in edge either
but I know that it is coming in
i think it just has to do with the notification handler
like the one that actually produces a notification when a push comes in
there
so as of now
it works on firefox on desktop
and chrome on android
what are your thoughts‚•πLemme see
1st,
Nice piano
Second,
Nice setup
3rd
Yea its good
It actually works‚•πit does
i mean
it doesn't completely
like
i still needed to copy and paste‚•πThe bare minimum works‚•πthe string
the subscription string
from the phone
to the pc
but‚•π^‚•πyes
so‚•πWe can build off of that‚•πi think this is doable‚•πNow‚•πeyeohesse‚•πI gotta figure out
Sekurity
On ios‚•πeyeohesse‚•πCancer‚•πayeohesse‚•πI dont wanna have to pay 100$ to do stuff‚•πa year‚•πIf it just needs a dev key then i might have one
Cause i have a dev account‚•πyeah if that's all we need‚•πJust not the fancy dev account‚•πthen its fine‚•πYea‚•πthen that would cover
the low power part of it
and then
all we need to do
is the real time stuff
as well as the long term stuff
and then
we are good
we have a chat app
well we also need a frontend
but other than that‚•πYea
And sekurity
But thats second‚•πwell sekurity
i mean
https
wss
and ur mostly good
you dont need server encryption
especially if you use telegram
which
does not have
end to end encryption
and all ur data
is in Dubai
or russia
pick your poison‚•πAh
So
U need fancy dev account
My free one has nothing‚•πyeahh
i mean
idk maybe theres some workaround‚•πI mean
I can always
Really shoddily make an app
Cause honestly‚•πyeah i mean
well‚•πId be the only one using it‚•πcuz the thing is
like
this chat app is for techies
so like
if they have ifone
they can download
ur source kode
and install it‚•πYea‚•πfor push support‚•πCause i am not fcking signing my apps
Why is the account 100$‚•πalternatively
you could just connect to telegram
and have it run pushes through telegram
or sms‚•πI mean i could
Making an app would be easier i think
As long as a backend exists‚•πyes
it is hard
to interface
with a
nonexistent
backend‚•πYup‚•πill start working on the backend tmrw‚•πNice
Imma start copying tg design‚•πi think imma do an update id
so like
each message
is associated
with an updateID
each message
or edit
or delete
so you create an unchanging stack of updates
and then
when a client connects
they can simply find the current update id they are on
and then
ask the server for all updates with id's newer than that
and then
you get sync
then i could use redis or something‚•πYea‚•πas a FIFO buffer‚•πWait should i add multi chat integration?‚•πyes
of course‚•πHmm alright‚•πbut the thing is this
it really only needs to do push
you can just have pushes redirect to the PWA
cuz the PWA will work on ios
just without pushes‚•πI essentially just have to redirect things right?‚•πyeah
so like
when you get a push‚•πI dont think thats allowed but ill try
Cause
Sekurity‚•πno it like
opens a link
so the notification
opens a link
and that link
opens in the PWA‚•πI see
Wait ur using a database right?‚•πno akhil im just gonna use a
what do you think imma use
yes i will use a db‚•πYes‚•πMongoDB‚•πOf couse
Json is the best
Better than the rest‚•πJsonDB
CyDB
this tho
since
i get free hosting
with them‚•πWait
Hold up
This could be super ez then‚•πwdym‚•πIf everything gets written to a db in the cloud
I can just tell swift to monitor said db‚•πwdym "monitor"‚•πLike if a new message gets added
Itll send a notification‚•πi mean
but then
it has to poll
the db‚•πRight
I forgot bout that‚•πnormally‚•πUgh‚•πyou just use push‚•πSekurity‚•πcuz the thing is‚•πSux‚•πpush
is nice
cuz its one thing
like
ios has a push service
and that is all that is polling
its probably really easy
to implement push
i mean after i stepped over the bumps
it was ez
to do push
with web‚•πIll see tmrw how to do it‚•πill see tmrw how to make a backend‚•πCause people have made chat apps with swift
But they use firebase‚•πhmm
idk see if you can find ways
for websites
to do push
on ios
without paying‚•πYea‚•πor if like
you can put it in like
"test mode"
or something
so that pushes work
cuz then
we have
one codebase
not many‚•πim gonna convert reality
Ah
The 4 religions of the book
R u kidding me
80$
For metal‚•πakhil go bing bong crash‚•πPretty much‚•πakhil and i
are making
a chat platform
we could call it cymbal
*sigh
im a little brain dead‚•πOf course‚•πryzen cpus are finally in stock
like actually in stock and not like 10 seconds sold out‚•πbois I hav big crisis
i just finished apcs song project
and i look back
and it no therte
like all code

ugggggggggg‚•πlike it no run either?‚•πi just spent like 3 hrs doing it
like there is no code to run
like the project revert‚•πreplit is like
similar to the stuff i make
it works

the loading bars start going backwards
and all the kode
disappears into the ether‚•πahahahhahaha, this is y i stick to rockets

also that site
can be installed
as a PWA‚•πfirefox dropped PWA support today
today‚•πwell
in chrome‚•πyes
i did that‚•πbut
then notifications dont work
because it wont show them
idk why‚•πedge‚•πit gets them
?‚•πsend one‚•πi need the string‚•πnot notif

bye‚•πso it works for you‚•πyes‚•πinteresting‚•πon lunix
i have to do work
bye‚•πbye‚•πwe can talk further
after
7th period tomorrow‚•πi have maths 7th period
haha
ik why
it wasnt
working for me
i had
dnd on
and chrome and edge were using native notifications‚•πI mean we do nothing in class anyway
so I mean we will now hav a productive period‚•πwhat class?‚•πthis is out of context of apcs
and what b happnin rn‚•πalso isnt it just great when u have a group PBT and the only parts u get right is the ones u did
ah‚•πhahahahahahahhahaahaa‚•πwe failed it
less than 50%
the only points we got were my parts‚•πbig sad
ut o
my zoom just crashed‚•πwell my grade didnt drop too much so im fine
nice‚•πwhen joining a breakout room‚•πmichael‚•πit b crasho‚•πmy zoom
is brok‚•πsame
it bork‚•πis take long time
for werk‚•πyuh
ima rejoin
cuz it dum‚•πmmf
hake
hokaye
michael here
his zoom broak‚•πhemlooo‚•πi wanna add the webhook
or just PR it‚•πemotes bot code is literal vomit‚•πill clean it up
I have to remove the API calls and make raw db calls anyway‚•πI mean I can try and find it
its like
somewhere
although
it has the botid
lemme find it‚•πimma generate uuids
e94b38f3d0dc4ee1840f7cbe760a3364‚•πyou there‚•πhola‚•πyes
what‚•πakhil
i just
asked someone with a mac
to try the pwatest
and notifications no work
akhil
send me a pushapi string
from pwatest
on a mac‚•πi clicked it like a million times‚•πtry chrome
cuz with this person the string worked in chrome
but
it wouldn't receive push‚•πi clicked the button‚•πwhich one‚•πrequest notification‚•πno now do subscribe‚•πi clicked‚•πwhat
no string?‚•πthat?‚•πyes
thx
one moment
turn of dnd
and wait for a noti
sent
received?‚•πnope‚•πhuh
sent again
this is weird‚•πnada
just to let u know‚•πwhat
what
hmm
do you have firefox‚•πnope‚•πwhat browser u hav‚•πsafari, edge‚•πah this was in edge
not chrome
ok
but
that shouldn't make a difference
from my testing
i think there is some issue with the service worker
although
the fetch event is not neccesary
for push to work
actually
edge and chrome do not use the same push services
ok so this needs some work
but
ik they should work on mac
once these issues are resolved
I'm in the lunch room
i will now
leave
the lunch room
actually
imma wait 2 mins‚•πwtf
why is the emoji thing required‚•πits so that like
for notifications‚•πtoo bad‚•πthat cannot display the stickers‚•πill just like
üí≠
for everything
...‚•πmy dad sent me the trump money sticker
but
it comes up as the regular money eyes emoji
in notis and previews
I'm leaving
bye‚•πbye
yes
ramesh did some cool thing
called a 512x512 blank webp‚•πI see‚•πmmmmm
aw
meh‚•πSTACY'S
so essentially
i copied
the playtools kode
and now
i will scrape out all the playtools stuff
but keep all the sign in and session management and headers and variables and time and all that tedious stuff
also
im getting a bit tired of inter
its a nice font
but
*sigh
i think imma find another font
for this app‚•πYes‚•πBest OS ever‚•πI see‚•πI shall now open‚•πHow much ram do u have?‚•π32GB‚•πCause u added an 8gb swap
Ah same
Then all u have to do is set up nixops
Make sure u add the thingies
U need an additional line that the guide doesnt show‚•πno nixops for this
this is a nas‚•πWait this is nas‚•πi dont need nixops‚•πRight
Nixops on the other one‚•πyuh‚•πUll find the line somewhere‚•πill figure it out after i set up the vm server‚•πI gotta see how to get docker compose to work
Yup‚•πah the delete_instance thing doesn't work
idk‚•π?‚•πflask‚•πAh
Pithon‚•πim in
i got into ssh nixos
now I can nicely edit the config‚•πBueno‚•πI also got telegram to work right
there‚•πTest 2
Has 12 cats‚•πyes it uploaded too many stickers‚•πHonestly im not even disappointed
Cats r great‚•πhaha
well now I gotta fix the local emotes

it is vomit
i told you
this kode
will give u
koronavirus‚•πjust like
*cygh‚•πlook
it works
what works
works‚•πbarely‚•πi mean
it works more than barely
its just‚•πits not working rn
try‚•πreally
ugly
you need
api‚•πim just scrapping this code
thanks‚•πyw‚•πim using PTB‚•πwhat is PTB‚•πPTB + webhooks
python-telegram-bot‚•πwhat is PTB
ah
ok‚•πuse PTB
for your bot
it also has webhook handling
using tornado‚•πill think about it
rn im making my own chat platform‚•πhah
when you forget to enable inline mode
telegram.error.BadRequest: Sticker_document_invalid
tasty
go boom‚•πgo boom‚•πbam
stress testing‚•πso what it does is this
it stores all the messages
in a dictionary
in ram
well
not a dictionary
a queue
and then
a worker
is responsible
for writing each item to the database
that way
the chat does not have db as a bottleneck
especially since im not using a local db
the instant chat runs in ram, over websockets
but persistence is achieved with a database
the only concern now
is that
if a user wants to recieve message updates
neither the db‚•πwhat
oh‚•πnor the ram
will have‚•πi am doing the telegram bot rn‚•πthe whole
set of messages
this is the dillema
and so
the proper way to get all most current messages
is to first subscribe
then
recieve hyper-realtime updates
then
see what updates you got
then
decide how much u wanna fill in
above those messages
then poll the api for those updates
but in order to ensure that no message is lost
like for example
it has been pulled from the queue
but
not in the db yet
there has to be overlap
between the ram and the db
*sigh
now
to figure this stuff out
heres a question
so
the messages
should i store them
in a giant pool
like
all the messages
from all the chats
are just in a pool
all together
or
should they be stored
in an array
that is a field of the group‚•πuhm
in an array‚•πsee but heres the thing
i need
to be able to
fetch
parts of that array
but not the whole thing at once
cuz if i have to fetch the whole thing
that increases load times
for larger chats‚•πit works
yes just fetch the recent history‚•πso i need to figure out
how to do this
in mongodb‚•πor you use postgres‚•πwhat is postgres
why
is it useful‚•πidk
pagination?
mongo should have it‚•πwhat is
pagination‚•πlook it up
ive like
never used it before
i just know it exists‚•πpymongo
has
aggregation
where like
you can filter stuff‚•πidk
no
it's like
limit in sql
select * from image limit 2‚•πwhat is from
that selects
items
from the list
but
that is a top level list‚•πidk‚•πk‚•πgoogle
well stuff seems to work‚•πstackoverflow
says no
it says
put them
all
in an unorganized collection‚•πstrftime python
yay I got rate limited
retry in 247 seconds
where is akhil‚•πpie thin
beautiful kode‚•πuse rust
idk‚•πi dont see that much better of a way to do this
unless‚•πafter working on this emotes thing‚•πthere was a‚•πliterally‚•πreturnwithout‚•πi hate python‚•πmethod
on dictionaries‚•πNixOS best
hey cy
the entire bot works‚•πyes
this does too‚•πreturn text/json‚•πi am‚•πfirefox renders it fancy‚•πyes
i know
idk why not working
ah wait
i think its
application/json
works now‚•πreturn jsonify‚•πyes
i could do
that
but
meh‚•πthat's probably not compressed so it's fine
um
did it stop recording
no it works
also it doesn't support gifs but who cares
gif support barely works anyway
Cy's code:‚•πas my third grade teacher used to call my handwriting‚•πRamesh's code‚•πill be honest
this is like
the worst code
i have ever
written
like
its usually not that bad‚•πlet's see some of your better code then‚•πum
ok‚•πfine
it's not that bad
yes
ramesh is kinda proud of adding tg support
why
why
why is there a circle
it literally says triangle for the love of god‚•πthe circle
makes it
an arrow‚•πtbh
whatever‚•πuh oh
you get to see my 503 page‚•πcan i have your haproxy config‚•πno‚•πwhy
i want to set up haproxy
thus I wanna see what it looks like
not all of the config‚•πgoogle it
its like‚•πyou can send me like a snippet‚•πthe easiest
thing
ever‚•πhuh
easier than nginx?
since im not even gonna be using nginx
im using caddy‚•πi mean
i only use it as a proxy‚•πyes‚•πim not sure if does web host‚•πthat is all I will be using haproxy for‚•πits like‚•πand caddy
its complicated‚•πyou define‚•πmy set up‚•πbackend
and frontent
and then
like
global settings
and that's it‚•πm ok‚•πand load balancing is literally
the word
like
and proxying websockets
is like
not a question
proxying https
without interrupting it
is like
you say tcp
instead of http‚•πyes
ik haproxy does
tcp proxying‚•πnginx its like
well‚•πbad
ive used it
apache2 is worse
imma do this‚•πthe most basic version of my chat app
is almost working‚•πthat is Very cool‚•πi have to
eat
dinner
with my family
so i will do that

I am alive
But dying‚•πour
chat app‚•πhi
things you missed‚•πWorks?‚•πramesh made emotesmlbot work
100% work‚•πPlease do‚•πalmost‚•πNice‚•πramesh is learning nix rn‚•πNice‚•πthe language‚•πi am leaving
bye‚•πIsnt it called hamskell or something?‚•πno
it's just nix
no haskell‚•πNixe
Ah that‚•πI see what you did there
it works‚•πYes‚•πalso gifs dont work so ur namespace doesnt work‚•πGood
Huh‚•πgifs r gonna be a nightmare‚•πThats fine‚•πill deal with it later
if i want‚•πCause tg specific format‚•πyeah
you have to turn it into like
a‚•πWhat r u gonna do with nix?‚•πnas
im already working on it‚•πI decided imma install tmrw‚•πi wiped out all the drives
nooo‚•πThe labguage?‚•πinstall it now‚•πI cant‚•πsat?‚•πI have a ton of work
Yea‚•πf‚•πCause im an idiot
And forgot to do the stuff‚•πnice
i never took an sat prep class‚•πLuckily
I am really quick at reading
I do it pretty fast‚•πooh nice
i am not good at the sat
so
*was
i had to get good duh‚•πObviously
What website r u using to learn nix
I wanna make a docker-compose thing in nix
So instead of using a yml file
I just write one in nix‚•πyou can autogenerate them
yes
but you have to learn nix first‚•πGracias
Ill do it after writing and language‚•πhaha
that sounds good
yo
what happens if we post emotes to HN?‚•π?‚•πyou post stuff here‚•πAh
Hacker news
Does it even have support for things like tenor?
Cause if it works with tenor it‚Äôll work with urs‚•πwdym tenor
it has twitch support though‚•πThe website
Does exactly what you do‚•πidk how to twitch
gifs
not emotes‚•πYea otherwise the same thing‚•πur saying i could upload it to tenor?
but it's not as easy to remember‚•πYea dont
I just realized u have ez to remember urls‚•πyes
it's also for discord remember‚•πI just tore apart my dads phone and repaired the charge port‚•πwhyphone‚•πYuh they suk
Bc a simple repair like having ur charge port replaced takes like the whole bord to b repaired
Bc they glue in the charge port even tho there is a separate connector‚•πhola‚•πhaha
ima make the chat thing do what chat things do‚•πlike
add emotes integration‚•πhey someone
could you
like
open this‚•πI am sending more messages‚•πfillin
my mongo‚•πyes
im brian kemp
i own guns‚•πI think I stopped you‚•πno
i left‚•πremind me to add spam protection‚•πyes
telegram has it‚•πthat was twenty thousand messages
in
like
30 seconds‚•πso why not you‚•πanyway
stress testing
my mongodb
is good‚•πgood‚•πits not mine
its literally
in iowa‚•πuse your own
smh‚•πi dont feel like it
just another hassle
and point
of failure‚•πI mean‚•πi will if i need more than 500MB
but i could just like‚•πYea‚•πbe space efficient
hi akhil‚•πHola‚•πyou can thank ramesh
for
literally
DOSing the app
before you could try it‚•πGracias
How
How did he manage it‚•πhe like
idk
did like
while true: send()
and as you know
websockets
are‚•πHi‚•πlike‚•πMy computer‚•πhe did‚•πAh‚•πIs frozen‚•π20k messages
in
30 seconds‚•πDamn
Owo nowo‚•πThe mouse wont move anymore‚•πhaha
take that
mine did not crash as much‚•πSad‚•πit just crashed the tab‚•πYeah but firefox‚•πMine crashed
And i wasnt even doing anything‚•πmak lol‚•πMac os is weird
It crashed cause of a cpu panic or something
Idk
Luckily it comes up pretty dang quick
Thats gonna take a while‚•πWas this because of me?‚•πNo‚•πHah‚•πU cant‚•πIt wouldve been funny‚•πIt would have‚•πRamesh has reminded me
i need
dos protection
cuz like
you can break it
with like
one machine‚•πBut i dont have random nginx stuff‚•πspamming‚•πLike cy does‚•πlol‚•πFail2ban‚•πYes
This is good‚•πnixbox‚•πOk maks kinda kool
It has stelf mode‚•πwhat?‚•πWhere if u ping it it wont respond
Fancy ikr‚•πoh
i see‚•πyes
wait
rameshs
entire
pc
crashed‚•πyes‚•πhe went capital‚•πit destroyed the entire thing
i think memory pressure
im doing it again‚•πMemory pressure?
Like blood pressure?‚•πthis idiot‚•πu no get another try‚•πis gonna spam cy again‚•πuntil‚•πHuh
It gonna take a while‚•πi mean
i could test‚•πits down‚•πyes
it is‚•πi cant connect‚•πbecause
i stopped it
and now
it is trying to stop
but before it stops
it empties the write queue
and you filled the write queue with 20k messages
its only supposed to hold like
5‚•πUm
Ramesh good job‚•πi could force stop it
yknow what
why not
lets do this again‚•πHaha
Cy‚•πonline‚•πU need better protection‚•πno protection
wait
ramesh
dont start yet
imma time it this time‚•πI have never seen someone
Want to be dosed before‚•πakhil
akhil
is a virus
ramesh
when you are ready
tell me‚•πI DIDNT EVEN DO ANYTHING‚•πi star the stopwatch
who is connected‚•πme‚•πah
send something‚•πum
it might be me‚•πnope
ramesh‚•πbut ur website is not loading
and doing anything‚•πdosed it‚•πPerfect‚•πits not dead tho
reload
its just ahtat
persistence
will not start
for a while
k so it did 5k in 15 seconds
yeah its about 15s per 5k
so about 333 per second
these are new ones
not adding to the previous ones‚•πwhat's the rate‚•πthis‚•πthis‚•πwdym‚•πu said theyre new‚•πyes‚•πthey're still
333/s?‚•πno while you were spamming
i timed
5k‚•πI did not spam‚•πyou did‚•πprove
i spammed‚•πum‚•πAh what‚•πum
akhil coulda done it‚•πI crashed my computer‚•πsince I don't think I did that‚•πNice
Somehow‚•πum‚•πBy being on ur website‚•πwelcome to the club‚•πmaybe it was akhil‚•πMy comps crashed
Idk the command‚•πuhhh‚•πunix
and linux
dying‚•πI would have done it‚•πuhhhhhhhhhhhhh
remember mongo is running on a server in iowa
„Ç¢„Ç§„Ç™„ÉØ
idk‚•πa solid 8gb‚•πLets see what apple says happened‚•πthis does not rely on mongo
mongo is dealt with in a worker‚•πcelery‚•πno
not celery
it uses python threading‚•πhuh‚•πon a raspberry pi
oh
that's why‚•πoh
ohhhh‚•πmy pc ram is not‚•πeven apple doesnt know what happened‚•πwait‚•πgoing up
i forgot
it was running on a pi‚•πright‚•πlets see the RAM usage of the pi
the pi has a direct 1gbps ethernet link
to the internet
340 mb in use
up from 240
which is the normal amount of ram
it uses
pi is nice
it cheap
and good
for web hosting
should i locally dos it‚•πyes‚•πk‚•πthen turn on cloudflare attack mode‚•πget a kali
live image‚•πthis does not run through cloudflare‚•πno
oh.‚•πum
what‚•πow
owwwww
owwwww
i just
bit
my lip
reallllly
hard‚•πget a band-aid‚•πstupid‚•πit like‚•πput it on ur lip
yes‚•πsticks out
no
we will
stop
talking
about my lip‚•πHAHA‚•πshould my platform
support
deleting messages‚•πyes‚•πofc‚•πlike an ethical question‚•πplease‚•πWe need to delete messages‚•πowwwwww
blood
lip‚•πhow
im confused‚•πi like
bit it
hard
like
real hard‚•πdid u like eat it?‚•πalmost
ima locally dos my server
lets do that
yes‚•πyes‚•πfrom a browser‚•πyes
yknow
multithreaded dosing would be VERY cool‚•πi got
12k
in 8 seconds‚•πbc ur local‚•πyes
wait
lets try
from a replit
no
too much work
go ahead‚•πNo wait‚•πits ws
thats why‚•πThat would be a good idea‚•πws is less common
to ddos
my database
is at 1MB‚•πrust: panic
go: panic
nix: abort‚•πChristopher nolans music for his movies is great‚•πyeah
imma listen‚•πI should do the nix thing‚•πif you want
you can
go into a replit
and install firefox
and dos it‚•πyeah but like‚•πHow?‚•πim lazy
pkg install firefox
idk‚•πI am also‚•πactually
imma just do it through python
wait
we could like
all‚•πit wont work‚•πrun the dos command at once‚•πidk how to websocket
client
i wanna do it with rust‚•πMy computer dies every time i do it‚•πand spawn hundreds of threads‚•πyou will hit a limit
on your‚•πim doing it‚•πbandwidth‚•πummmm
ill run it for like
10 seconds‚•πu have gigabit?‚•πno
also i wont
my brother is doing an interview rn
and like it might crash the internet‚•πah‚•πi would rather not crash the internet rn
my parents will kill me‚•πyes‚•πand so will my brother‚•πyes
lets see
so
ok so
essentially‚•πi can write it for you
i know how to thread in rust‚•πik python‚•πrust threading is real threading‚•πi mean in python
i was able to‚•πGIL‚•πconcurrently download
500 instances
of reddit
at 400 mbps‚•πhaha‚•π400mbps
is like
the highest it gets
up here
on WiFi‚•πmm‚•πakhil
akhil
its
an
and it
works‚•πimma eat
afk
bye‚•πi think
it is time
to make
the thing
work
cuz right now
when you open the chat
1. ramesh doses it
and
2.
it doesn't load message history
which is saved
if
3. ramesh doesn't dos it
so
i need to make it
retrieve message history
i mean frankly
this is a decent simulation
of like
6 months worth of messages
being stored
my favorite app is playtools
it like
ddosses itself
theres a bug
where
the players
will turn into
an uncoordinated ddos network
aimed directly at the server and the database‚•πje suis ici‚•πbonjour
cy forgot‚•πbonjour‚•πhow do use
XMLHttpRequest‚•πuhm
use fetch
not xmlhttprequest‚•πhow‚•πidk look at MDN‚•πwhat does this mean‚•πconvert response to json
for further processing later‚•πso like
but
why not
response = response.json()
jason‚•πidk
it's stupid‚•πoh ik
why
its because‚•πasync?‚•πthen is a function‚•πyes‚•πno like‚•πit returns a promise‚•π=>
means
function‚•πuhh‚•πso it defines
a function‚•πidk i dont like js
the end‚•πthat takes
response
and then
converts it to json
and returns that
then
it takes that
passes it into data
and then logs that
i get
it‚•πi have to get my food‚•πk‚•πi do not understand fold
at all‚•πwhat‚•πtelegram‚•πhow
do
i
what
why
how
it
ramesh
it is telling me
how on earth did it not parse the json‚•πbad json
that's how‚•πbut‚•πi dont know
why is fold so confusing
literally‚•πi need
to
do
cors
cors
i have to like
stop cors
server side
ez
could i ask
someone
to go to
that page
and not dos it
and
test it‚•πI
idk‚•πgo to the page‚•πthis is hard‚•πtype messages‚•πliterally this seems easy
l8r
wait
this is hard apparently
got it on the second try
the first try I forgot a semicolon
k im done with that
FINALLY‚•πk so now
the database is strictly
persistence‚•πcan I break it‚•πno
you can examine how
despite
me
adding
a
synthetic
5s latency
on all calls to the db
the thing still works
and still updates
when you refresh it
it still works
just fine
it does not rely on the db
i could kill the db
and one‚•πhmm‚•πcould hold a conversation
until
the ram
on my pi
ran out
that said
it is bad
to run it
without the db
cuz the only way to get messages without the db
when you connect
but this is good enough
to cover the like
2 or 3
messages
that might not be persistent yet‚•πwhat if‚•πwhen a user connects‚•πthe messages
dont get saved anymore‚•πwdym‚•πlike
if the db crashes
no
yes‚•πit wont‚•πhow do you know‚•πthe only way it crashes
is if i
break it
or
if it runs out
of space
also
the worker would likely crash
if the db died
and if the worker crashes
the realtime still works
but the persistence wont‚•πit seems that nixos
has a firewall
i can access localhost from localhost
but not from elsewhere
et voil√†
√ßa marche‚•πcdknight: it works‚•πif anyone is still awake‚•πwhat‚•πit now
does
things
it now
persists
and
it has
infinite scroll‚•πhmm
link it
wgat‚•πwgat‚•πif you are making a custom chat platform
please
please
please add custom message types
like imessage‚•πwdym
custom message types
xPlane‚•πi have a doc on it
give me a few minutes
idk
even i cant read that
no not that‚•πramesh
give‚•πno‚•πa high level
explanation‚•πim reading
custom message types are html5 boxes within the chat application‚•πso like‚•πthat way they are cross-platform
wait
let me finish‚•πa little app‚•πyes‚•πiframe‚•πit gets embedded
then what happens is‚•πno
not iframe‚•πnot iframe
it can be like
a div‚•πthe app
can call
functions
of the chat application‚•πno basically
when you send a custom message
it will go and send a request to the custom message server
with some chat info
like the room name
and the sender
and like the other people in the room maybe
then the custom message server will take this data and return html
the chat application will mount the html
then
or maybe it's not html
maybe it's like a custom language‚•πhold on
but
so
whats the purpose of these‚•πimessage‚•πno‚•πgamepidgeon‚•πso like‚•πheart rate‚•πto embed games
or bots
or polls‚•πand emotes
whatever it is
yes‚•πhmm‚•πif you make this
you don't have to implement that
I can
implement it‚•πso the way i would do this
is
i would have the message contain a "schema"
as you say
which would contain
a width‚•πyes‚•πheight
and url
and then‚•πyes
like webhook urls basically‚•πhmm
idk i have to think how that would be implemented‚•πI had an idea
then I forgot it‚•πwell cuz like‚•πlike I actually had a very detailed plan on this‚•πif you want the embedded "app"
to be able to operate chat
security and authority are things‚•πyes they are‚•πso you could have apps that cannot operate chat‚•πyou have a marketplace‚•πyes
and so‚•πverified apps
unverified apps‚•πthey have to be authorized
then they can access things
otherwise
they can only embed
hmm
interesting‚•πyes
you could use stickers
that are only embed
and like‚•πyes‚•πidk‚•πso its like
just
a remote server
fetched
thing‚•πalso it could have access to sesnors‚•πyes‚•πbut that would work because it's a webview
btw i actually made an app like this before‚•πi see
the problem is this
how do you prevent
a script
in the thing
from
accessing
the global app's functions‚•πXSS?‚•πyes
essentially‚•πwhy disable javascript
easy‚•πon what‚•πthe stuff that comes from the external apps‚•πwait
is that like‚•πthat could be a problem‚•πa property
of the div‚•πno
dont disable javascript
just like‚•πit needs to be containerized
somehow‚•πim thinking
this is a non-issue for phones‚•πwhy‚•πit's not running
like that
it's running as an app‚•πits a PWA on phones
so its still an issue‚•πum‚•πwhat about a safe tag‚•πwhat is that‚•πits a tag
in html
that
gets rid of
all dangerous things
like scripts
embeds
onclick
all that‚•πthats a server side thing‚•πno
wait
is it‚•πyes
ha‚•πi think it would have to be an iframe‚•πyes
or‚•πbut not a sandbox‚•πyou could come up with your own UI rendering system‚•πno
i could but like
no
an iframe is easier‚•πyes‚•πalso
that "schema"
would have
a webhook url
that
the client
would send data to
to identify
the chat
so like
ppl in the same chat
could like
play the same game
so like‚•πyes‚•πyou send a schema
the schema says‚•πfor each different user‚•π400px‚•πit sends a different‚•π400px‚•πuser
id
to the webhook‚•πsome_url_for_iframe
some_url_for_groupid
but then
the embedded app
has to do the rest‚•πyes‚•πalso it could have "options"
which would be rendered
by the client
and would be able to perform chat actions‚•πhmm
i guess
the thing is if you implement this tiny framework you can build rich interactions entirely with this
like no need for bots‚•πwell
bots‚•πliterally this could cover bots‚•πcan read messages
this cannot‚•πmm
you can do something about that‚•πno the idea is
these things are containerized
so they can like
place things on screen
and run in their own little container
but
they cant do anything else
for security
if you want
you could add their associated bot
which could read messages
and send
and such‚•πmaybe
what if you got the containerized stuff
to run on the chat server
so it can't leave the server‚•πbut whatever it is
it cannot‚•πthen that would be a burden on you to set up things‚•πyes
but also
it would not be neccesary
the dev of the embedded app
simply has to
host a site
that can be embedded
in an iframe
and host
a config file‚•πyes‚•πwith like
their app's name
and icon
and width
and height
and such‚•πyes
what about transparency
like a transparent frame‚•πwhy would you want that‚•πstickers‚•πbut
stickers
can be predefined
except unlike telegram
support fetching from url‚•πor
if you just
implemented transparency
there would be no need to implement stickers‚•πa transparent iframe‚•πmake the core app smaller
it could use js canvases as stuff
and 3.js‚•πno
that's
too much‚•πagain‚•πstickers
should be‚•πthat's not what you're implementing
leave the stickers to other people
"small government"‚•πramesh is a conservative
the thing is
how
do
you make
an iframe
transparent‚•πjust like
you dont do work
they do the work‚•πhmm
that is
interesting
so essentially
in chat apps
would have "screens"
defined in their config
one of the screens
would be the keyboard screen
with this
they would be able to
interact and choose what they want to send
then
once they select what they want to send
the embed
sends an xhr to its server
and then
prompts the user to press "send"
and then
Triangle
sends a request
to that server
asking
what the user selected
and what to send
and then
the server returns what to send
and that is send as a new "screen"
or actually no
there would only be one preset screen
which is the picker‚•πidk‚•πso in place of a mobile keyboard
would be the picker‚•πyes‚•πthis picker
allows a user
to select
games
stickers
emotes
whatever
and then
somehow
send them‚•πi wanna
write my own smb server‚•π*yawn
go do that
imma sleep‚•πsamba isa piece of garbage
this works
hey cy get on the train
nixops is great‚•πi see‚•πdo you know what it does‚•πi might try it
next time‚•πNixops is great‚•πi need
what does it do‚•πprogramatically define vms
and all the services inside it‚•πi see
how difficult is it‚•πso if you want to run playtools if you make a nix service‚•πto set up‚•πa bit tricky
but we did the hard work
so you don't have to‚•πNormally its ez‚•πno
it's broken‚•πWell hold on‚•πi mean
i think
i wanna run‚•πWe technically didnt‚•πPlayTools
serverless
on like
heroku
or google AppEngine
or something‚•πSome guy on github did
Ive heard about this
Never tried it‚•πthe thing is
playtools
can be run serverless
like
completely serverless‚•πPretty sure we get some deal with github dev pack‚•πlike
no workers
are required
so i think
i could get like
realllllly cheap‚•πHuh‚•πatm im designing the Triangle Chat app‚•πtf is xinetd‚•πit like
doesn't look that good yet
im making it a material dark theme tho
and its gonna be kool
and imma have to learn about
client side rendering
cuz the app is gonna be entirely client side
like
a static page
i have to eat dinner
bye‚•π‚Ä¶
client side rendering aint fun‚•πalas
it is time
to learn
jquery‚•πplease no‚•πalas
yes
idk‚•πstop using jquery.‚•πi was using the dom api
but then like
it gets tedius‚•πwhaddya wanna do with jquery‚•πlotsa stuff
idk
maybe ill start
without jquery
ill see how far i get with native apis‚•πyes
do that pwease
im betting‚•πhow do you like
set‚•πby the end of cy's 11th‚•πlotsa‚•πhe is a‚•πcss properties‚•πmac dev
who only writes nodejs
and full stack web apps
uhm
like
idk‚•πwhat is a "full stack"‚•πline by line
idk but
you will know
by the end of 11th grade
my statement is thus still true‚•πah yes
full stack
like
the whole thing
yes‚•πnow I gotta‚•πi am
that type
of person‚•πyes
but then you will write everything in express
and use react‚•πi might‚•πand swear by your macbook pro‚•πno‚•πyes
watch‚•πwindows
is good
they are adding lots of
features
desirable features
like wsl‚•πjust watch‚•πapparently
this year
windows will gain the ability
to run android apps
natively‚•πum
what
google is gonna get mad about that‚•πtheyre gonna start
sans google play services
then
theyre gonna try and make deals with google‚•πmicrosoft play services‚•πto get access‚•πum
how though
using wsl2?
as the android kernel?‚•πidk
but its a similar idea‚•πmeow
port fawhwading in nixos‚•πactually
i think
no
so what
will happen‚•πis
that‚•πis that devs will have to
submit their android apps
to the Microsoft store
stripped of google play services‚•πwhat about flutter
will that work with microsoft's android runtime‚•πidk
also
apparently
wsl
can do gui now
and gpu acceleration‚•πeee
embrace
extend
extinguish‚•πSteveBallmer‚•π"get on your feet"
"aaah"
"aaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaAaaaAaaAAaaAaaaah"
idk that
makes me laugh every time‚•πdevelopers
developers
developers
developers
developers
developers
developers
developers
developers
developers
developers‚•πyes
i need to find the destination programatically‚•πima make the chat frontend
also
i just realized
telegram chats
are not
encrypted‚•πyes‚•πon the server
so the russians‚•πoh‚•πand the saudis
can see‚•πtelegram isn't‚•πeverything
we send‚•πyes‚•πeven facebook
doesn't do this‚•πyes
unless you use encrypted chats‚•πthis chat
is not
encrypted‚•πyes ik
and you can't have encrypted chats
on the desktop
only on y0our phone‚•πyou cant have encrypted
group chats‚•πyes you can
on matrix‚•πno i mean
not on telegram
Triangle will not have server side encryption
but
it will not be
in russia
or dubai‚•πtriangle should like‚•πshould
what‚•πlike
not store any messages
at all
that would be cool‚•πno
i want
a cloud backed
messenger
i want a challenge
if u want
no stored messages
use nochat
it does not store your messages
or use signal‚•πwhat is nochat‚•πit also doesn't store messages
nochat‚•πoh right nochat
fix
nochat‚•πi was gonna add like
something
to stop that
then
i said
no
i have‚•πyou can sanitize it somehow‚•πyeah
<safe>
well actually
no
you just‚•πno I‚•πban‚•πI did this for flim‚•πFLIM
my mom‚•πhush‚•πstudies that‚•πI ‚Ä¶ see‚•πshe like
talks about it
all the time
although
now
she speaks
of
Light Sheet‚•πi see‚•πLSM‚•πLSM
int√©rssant‚•πshe wants
a microscope
that costs
800k dollers‚•πget it‚•πand so
she writes to
ppl
and tell them
i wanna moneys
and then
she needs a workstation
also
she will have to use Linux‚•πyay‚•πbecause
the Rutgers supercomputer cluster
requires linux
i think‚•πI see
doesnt do anything yet
but it is mine
for two years‚•πi see‚•πcy should try nixos
eys
like that‚•πTechAltar‚•πthe beginning song is good
HA
YES‚•πD‚•πYES YES YES
I LIKE IT‚•πappl
has not
piqued‚•πgood‚•πtheir interest‚•πgood
i like that‚•πdoes nix have apt‚•πno
nix is a package manager btw‚•πi see‚•πyou can install it on debian if you want‚•πi see
so its essentially
a list
of packages‚•πnot really‚•πthat it stores‚•πyou can define functions
it's a programming language
to generate a list of packages
with configuration attached
which it then turns into what you'd see on debian‚•πi see‚•πyes
you see‚•πima continue
working
on my chat
frontend‚•πyou should deploy stuff on nixos
it would make things easier perhaps
idk
time to ssh into aws‚•πeww aws
amazon bad‚•πmeh‚•πuse
google
liniode
vultr‚•πmy parents only know about aws‚•πdigitalocean‚•πso they will only fund me on aws
so it's fine‚•πvultr is cheaper
than aws
vultr has 3.50 option
and even 2.50 option‚•πIM HAPPY‚•πwhat‚•πwhat‚•πI can edit router setting now‚•πah‚•πwait how‚•πyes
that
can make
one
happy
optimum
unborked‚•πyes‚•πyes
this
is
amazing‚•πcy
how do i haproxy
just like
haproxy one thing‚•πshould i do
what ramesh
would do
and say
"google it"‚•πno‚•πor‚•πplease‚•πshould i actually
send
relevant info‚•πi mean u should
cause u got haproxy working‚•πhere lemme
ssh
into my server
with haproxy‚•πgoogle it is a way of saying idk figure it out‚•πrtfm‚•πk im in
imma figure this out‚•πif i forward a port
and nothing is listening
does a port scan still see if the port is open?‚•πidk‚•πcause i need to see if port 25 actually gets forwarded now‚•πi needa haproxy http and https
hmm
I see
wait
so your https doesn't do like let's encrypt right
it just sends it‚•πit does
nothing‚•πk‚•πit just proxies‚•πdoes it preserve the host IP?‚•πno
wait
wdym‚•πlike can you get the ip address
of the person who connects
using haproxy‚•πidk havent tried
but also‚•πi need that‚•πthere are so many other things‚•πi mean
tbh‚•πpreventing me from doing that‚•πit should be fine
dw about it
how do i
include a file‚•πidk‚•πforget it
ill just
put it in the big file
interesting
ugh
wireguard is being a problem‚•πcy is
*cough
liking
*cough
client
side
rendering
not liking
he has to like‚•πHa.
i ahte it‚•πcreate his elements‚•πtoo‚•πin js‚•πidk i hate it too‚•πthere must be a library
for this‚•πoh
ramesh is dumb
no ramesh is not dumb‚•πwait
HTML5 templates
are a thing
lets use
ona those‚•πuse
emberjs‚•πwhat if
i can
avoid
that
and just
use regular js‚•πmaybe‚•πits like‚•πidk i gave up around this point‚•πyou make a template‚•πI think it is a good idea‚•πimport it in the js‚•πsince it's less work to get data from the server and put it on the client‚•πthen like
modify it
then
append it‚•πuhm
I think react/vue
is supposed to be for this purpose‚•πyes‚•πit does the templates‚•πi like
server side
rendering
but
im not
using it
idk why
idk if this is really "client side rendering"
its like‚•πit doesn't have to be‚•πjust
a ton
of updating
on the page
its faster in the end
since
you are not navigating between pages
and since its a pwa
the whole thing gets cached the first time
and so
load times
are not a thing
so it just reduces
all the load
everywhere
and it works offline
which is
the most
important thing
for a chat app‚•πidk
how to do that‚•πimma use a template‚•πtry it out
eventually
you will want to try react‚•π^^ from 2013
i might
want to
but
not now‚•πit would be funny if wireguard wasn't working because of scamazon
um
i think i have a typo
no im just a huge idiot
I forgot
I FORGOT
to add the external ip
and then i wonder why it doesnt work
hmm.
haproxy keeps timing out
ramesh is dumb
I just
crashed tmux‚•πi see
i just‚•πhow‚•πgot‚•πis this even possible‚•πthings
to work‚•πi am closer
caddy is trying to spam the letsencrypt servers
but I want it to do a selfsigned
unless of course
caddy doesn't let you
turn of https‚•πcy is happy‚•πwhich would be royally stupid‚•πthings
work
time to add
actual
functionality
*sigh
already at 300 lines‚•πso
nvm
it doesn't look bad‚•πthat's the point
im glad you noticed‚•πform > functionality‚•πyes
atm
yes
cuz
it does
nothing
i am excited
when this is done
i will finally
have a chat platform‚•πyes‚•πwithout compromise‚•πwill you make everyone switch to it‚•πyes
i will‚•πexcept me
i like telegram‚•πyou will be able
to embed
apps
in this platform‚•πwe shall cyee‚•πthe thing is
like
this chat platform is like
not a literal joke
like
nochat
or the zoom chat
what
are
you
doing‚•πsetting up a reverse proxy‚•πhow
long
does that take‚•πa long time‚•πyou have been doing this since like
why‚•πidk
idk how to use caddy cy‚•πcaddy?‚•πso
i have to figure it out‚•πk
imma add functionality
ttyl
ow rite just forgot
this whole thing
has to work
on mobile
fun
ooh my dad is watching something
i didn't know chrome just like
monitored cast devices
i have switched to chrome‚•πyes you can do that
bad
bad
bad
bad‚•πedge
is dead
it like
doesn't work
anymore‚•πget vivaldi
it's like
better than chrome‚•πno i wanna use chrome
so Microsoft gets mad
and sees
they lost a user
to chrome
because edge broke‚•πno use vivaldi‚•πalso chrome is kinda nice since it syncs with google
so
and its the most popular browser
so its good for dev
what i dont understand
is why
Microsoft
leaves
their browser's logo
as
an E
literally like 50% of their userbase
associates "E"‚•πwith internet‚•πwith old, slow, outdated, obselete‚•πexplorer
since it's microsoft‚•πlike
dont call it edge
call it like
anything else‚•πwhat happens if I run reboot on aws
will it destroy everything‚•πidk
replit is interesting
it like
does something similar to nix i think
when you leave a replit untouched
it erases the container
and then
when you come back
it regenerates it
and reinstalls everything‚•πAh.
I fixed it.
no
nix doesn't delete it
nix generates it‚•πik‚•πbut if you DO delete it you can‚•πbut replit has a way‚•πFinally.‚•πto like‚•πLiterally finally‚•πi like how this
brings joy
you can borrow my Haproxy
503 page‚•πno
i wanna make my own
with css
caddy is bad
hmm
ah
it doesnt work
cuz
cloudlfare
Interesting
wont work rn‚•πgreat
now
i
have‚•πit like works some places‚•πto deal with
nginx‚•πand doesnt
I use caddy
btw‚Ñ¢
this is a thing‚•πwhat is
teakettl
wait
it loaded‚•πidk why it takes so long‚•πthat took forever tho‚•πit shouldnt
i shall iperf‚•πso its like
gitea
but like
kettl
but like
teakettl
ok‚•πyes
gitea ‚Üí caddy ‚Üí haproxy ‚Üí web
dont ask
im
crazy‚•πi mean
apache ‚Üí nginx ‚Üí haproxy ‚Üí web‚•πmm
i mean
nixos does a lot of abstraction
it will do even more abstraction later‚•πasdfa;sdlkfa;sdlkfj;aslkdf nginx
not working
i need to serve a web page
and its not
working.‚•πthe speed is too slow for my liking which is unacceptable
yes‚•πi must now
identify
why
hi
did i ask
for
this‚•πno
nginx bad
use caddy‚•πno i will
use
nginx
a;sdflka;sdlkfja;sldkfj
the file
is
right
there
just
open
the damn file
why
doesnt‚•πit's nginx‚•πit work‚•πbeing useless‚•πits good when it works
when it doesnt
its bad‚•πsee wireguard is running at kbps
no it's running at like 100mbps
so
also it loads instantly
on curl
which is strange
hmm
I am doing a change‚•πhere
there
it appears
now its time
to make it
actually
get‚•πi cant‚•πand send
messages‚•πsend stuff‚•πyes
that's cuz
it does
nothing‚•πhuh‚•πthats a job for now‚•πI did not
copy your haproxy config
so
idk y it's slooooow‚•πidk either‚•π20 seconds to load
that is a problem.
i removed roundrobin and it now loads a bit faster‚•πi wuv web dev
a;sdlkfja;sdlkfja;slkdfj;aslkdfj‚•πthis speed is atrocious
literally
gitea should take less than a second to load
literally
I have identified the issue as haproxy
imma use varnish
hmm
wtf is this performance‚•πhmm
idk‚•πHmm
I wonder if I bump up the specs if it will work
the vm is running on lik
500 mb‚•πthe lowest end
ec2
which costs $0.20 less on vultr‚•π1 way  is fast
the other not so much‚•πcy is like so mad
its not
scrolling‚•πthis may be it‚•πit kinda
works now
can u clik
and like
send
*Sigh‚•πyes‚•πk
i believe
that has been
mostly
mitigated‚•πfix it‚•πfix what‚•πrate limiting
is a thing‚•πyes
that i have
not implemented‚•πnot yet implemented‚•πi shall‚•πwireguard is infuriating‚•πbut for now
avoid‚•πi rebooted
the aws
conclusion: the bridge is slow; get rid of bridging and things will be fast‚•πcy is done
for today
it scrolls now
as well‚•πI moved it to linode
and it loads faster
this
ah
this is on fios‚•πI'm on wifi on my phone‚•π...‚•πshould i do that from my nextcloud server
on ethernet‚•πyes
ok
i hate optimum
tf
yes
i get like
5 mbps‚•πi wanteda send an emote
but
bot ded‚•πyes
i killed emotes
imma fix it
im changing it from linode to aws‚•πwhy‚•πlinode
is faster than aws
for me‚•πfrom linode to aws
so ur making it slower‚•πno it wont
it will be the same
the iperf speed and wireguard speed‚•πbut‚•πis faster‚•πwhy
are you‚•πfrom aws to linode‚•πswitching‚•πso I have to use linode for my reverse proxy‚•πfrom aws‚•πand aws for emotes‚•πor from linode
get a load balancer
imma get a vultr‚•πi cant‚•πi see
vultr is just cheaper
so i can get 2 vms
instead of 1
they have a cheaper option
also they have an even cheaper option
that has no ipv4
idk how that even works‚•πIpv2‚•πno it has ipv6‚•πOh wait what?‚•πimma haproxy gunicorn
nginx bad
oh wait i have a bunch of certificates
ahh‚•πThats cool
Im sad
Cause my macs being a bad‚•πi see‚•πAnd cant ssh into my rpi‚•πon ur mac
it is kinda
crap‚•πima fix‚•πon phone‚•πemotes later‚•πUm‚•πas of now
its gonna improve‚•πit will be a bit complex
bye‚•πbye‚•πi gotta homework‚•πI also have to
Linix‚•πLinix Indeed
could someone explain
to me
what the deal is
tmrw
with 
"abbreviated"
schedule‚•πi haventh noth clue
it makes no sense‚•πakhil
are u on mac
rn‚•πum yes\
im always on mac
doesnt exist‚•π404?‚•πno cause u spelt it wrong‚•πhaha‚•πes bueno
doesnt look half bad‚•πwait reload‚•πthe message stays‚•πreload
again
um
it looks laggy for some reason
in the video
its not tho
some advancements were made
it is now
a PWA
and
best of all
it vibrates
like
when messages come in
like just a little click
for each message
most important feature.‚•πhmm
brrrrr‚•πworks on mobile
as a pwa‚•πin a few seconds
i will see
k now i will see
im done with my homework‚•πdont spam
we should switch to Triangle
when its done‚•πif it's a flutter app
yes
else no‚•πwhy do you want a flutter app
you know
it would just be
a web app
if it were
a flutter app‚•πnot really
flutter is not web
literally it's not‚•πwell its not if you like
compile it for android
but then like
i have to pay
moneys
also flutter apps are like
really ugly‚•πno not really‚•πthey like
have their own frame
and their own things‚•πyou can use the cupertino theme‚•πand they are not like
native
if anything
i would use react native‚•πis a flutter app‚•πi have seen that app
i dislike it
it is
ugly
really ugly‚•πnot really
you think it is‚•πits slow
and ugly
idk i could make a flutter app
but its just like
not nice
the only thing it would give me is like
notifications
on ios
what is wrong
with PWA
haha
i just
clicked
a text field
in the flutter demo app
and it crashed
what is wrong
with pwa
ramesh
i wanna know
also
i dont like
ios
ios
needs
to end‚•πchrome‚•πwhat about it‚•πpwas
dont work
are not a thing
on firefox‚•πthen
dont use‚•πthey do work‚•πfirefox‚•πcongratulations
you have contributed to
vendor lockin‚•πit is not
vender lockin
blink
is open source
android is open source
anyone
can make
anything
based on those
pwas are a standard
that anyone can support
we must support standards
cy is mad
because
apple
doesnt
support
standards
theres this thing called cordova tho
that lets you turn web apps into mobile apps
idk if its any good
but imma try it
cuz i have some experience with it
from the 4H app
which was written in Ionic
and compiled with Cordova
it was not
that good
though
the speed
was
questionable
but
the app ended up on the app store and the google play store‚•πf-droid
cy wanted to know what kubernetes is
it is basically a really overcomplicated docker-compose‚•πcy doesn't know what docker is‚•πcy needs to get his homelab skills in order‚•πyes
what is a homelab‚•π‚Ä¶
look it up on urban dictionary‚•πits like
your servers
at home‚•πyes
wait why did I say look it up
I need to get out of this habit
I should define terms that I know‚•πyes‚•πI'm going to try to fix that
let's see
it's also like
managing those servers
in an interesting way‚•πyes
idk
im more into
making things happen
rather than
like
working with servers‚•πI am interested in
writing programs
to make things work with my servers‚•πOk‚•πi also dont like
have‚•πA homelab‚•πyou do‚•πIs‚•πyou have a server
pis count‚•πA lab
That is at home‚•πü§Ø‚•πits like a lab where you experiment with servers‚•πyes
but not experiment‚•πidk i have a pi‚•πit can also do stuff‚•πand it runs
all my web
infrastructure
so its like
important‚•πIn essence‚•πhow do you deploy
your web stuff‚•πIs a computer lab‚•πftp is boring, make a docker registry
and build your services
and then use your private docker registry to run them with docker-compose‚•πidk
i just like
host them
with nginx
or
like‚•πDocker compose is bueno‚•πyes
i should learn how to use docker‚•πI know how to use it but I am going to switch to nix‚•πIt‚Äôs ez‚•πi was gonna learn about docker
but i never got to it
cuz i didn't need it‚•πNix docker has its own thing
I‚Äôm gonna use that‚•πyeah
idk i am into the idea of just doing
and being done
no docker‚•πI like docker‚•πi wanna try a serverless platform‚•πI kinda need docker‚•πtry like
theres a thing thats not heroku
it's self hosted
but not heroku‚•πno
i want something
not
self hosted
because
that is fundamentally
not
serveless
i want to host an app
for low cost
reliably
off site‚•πit isn't
the thing here is that it isn't
since this runs on someone else's server‚•πwhos server‚•πheroku's‚•πbut then its abstracted
so its not relevant to me‚•πbut it is like
not serverless
it's offsite
but definitely not serverless
idk I'm nitpicking
you can ignore me‚•πit will always have a server
but
if its "serverless"
im not paying for
a server‚•πum
you're paying for their server‚•πno
you pay
not for that
you pay for requests
to ur app
unlike paying for a VPS
where its like
ur paying for a vm
which serves stuff‚•πidk
show me a service like that
also I will disappear for a few minutes
I have to do things‚•πGoogle App Engine
PythonAnywhere
Heroku‚•πdon't you love it when your program crashes when you try to run git push
Yes OOM errors are beautiful
song
Yes
I saw that
if you have a study hall
you don't do anything
just go do whatever you want‚•πnice‚•πcy is sad
what is this
even google chrome
has glitches
with filters‚•πaptX‚•πaptX
yes‚•πon lunix‚•πQUALCOMM‚•πdoes windoze
have aptX‚•πyes
natively‚•πInteresting‚•πbecause like
Surface Headphones
have aptX‚•πThere better be
A snow day tmrw‚•πYes
I agree‚•πThey have to
They cant make excuses by making us go virtual‚•πNo they can just make the whole week virtual‚•πEverybody is just gonna be pissed
If they do that‚•πYes‚•πGive us a break‚•πBut they can
Meh idrc
I like Mondays off‚•πI would rather‚•πTuesday meh‚•πthey give us off
like that week in march in 8th grade
when I went to cy's house every day
since it was all snow days‚•πYou went to my house?‚•πyes
imagine that happenign‚•πI don't remember that‚•πill find my hangouts logs‚•πI wish it weren't the pandemic‚•πcy this was in like
2018‚•πYes
Vaksine
I want
Vaksine‚•πNix
is a programming language‚•πI see
My dad is gonna force me to shovel snow‚•πnow I will modify my config file
idk about my parents
i will tho
look nix is really cool
watch this goes to‚•πMaybe I use nix
Should I set up another pi
For homelabbing‚•πthis is wrong‚•πOr should I buy a server
For homelabbing‚•πwait
wtf is wrong with this thing‚•πDon't send reallllllly wide images
They don't appear as images
It's annoying
The aspect ratio must be less than a certain amount‚•πwhy‚•πIdk
Telegram
Let's switch to Triangle
Once it's in order
I can make it such that it works for all of us
Granted we will actually use it‚•πif it works
there
nixos is building my entire service
from git
bing bang boom‚•πWhat would it take for you to use Triangle‚•πcustom message types
and a very scriptable platform‚•πOther than that‚•πthat's it
and like
a decent phone app‚•πThose are both on the plan‚•πthat is not a pwa hopefully
react native is fine too‚•πThe problem is like
Wait
What if I did Cordova
Would that be sufficient‚•πyes‚•πLike the web app‚•πyes that would be fine‚•πBut through Cordova‚•πi want an apk
also firefox support
i want firefox support‚•πThe thing is it would be slower
Than a native pwa‚•πfine
but I also want firefox support‚•πIt works in firefox
And safari
Well actually there's a ui glitch on mobile firefox
But I can fix it‚•πyes
see you need to fix it‚•πShould I post it on GitHub
So you can contribute‚•πyes
and learn git‚•πExpo Go React Native demos‚•πthat works
ramesh destroyed his vm
so we're seeing if it'll load now
from scratch‚•πDude sudo is way to overpowered‚•πafter mysqlbackup was run‚•πU can sudo passwd root
To change the root password
As a user‚•πAhhh I'm kinda scared
will it work
will it work
will it work‚•πItll work‚•πnah
no way
my rpi
can kill itself‚•πNo hold on
Cats are good
My rpi
Can go kill itself‚•πyeah true
welp
it deleted the database it seems
who
not you
someone else‚•πMy brother‚•πuhm
Oh
I figured it out
I think
imma fix this big issue
duolingo
what is yann learning
"lolydodo"‚•πNo snow day‚•πik
its pissing me off
Its so stupid
where do our snow days go?‚•πThere are none this year
So if we get them
We lose winter break days‚•πthats fine
winter break passed already‚•πSpring break‚•πik‚•πWhatever‚•πits a scheme
a conspiracy
they dont wanna give us snow days
this is communism
unjust treatment‚•π*sigh

I just haven't used it yet
not now‚•πYes now‚•πyes I want to
but not now‚•πomg
gunicorn
is like
the easiest thing
im worried
that vultr
will be slower
than a raspberry pi
also should i use a local mongodb
for playtools
or should i use Atlas
Atlas is easier
but it uses my bandwidth
but i have like 500GB
and im about to fix the auto-self-ddos bug
someone
is this clear
like
what would you do
if you were "cy from gunicorn"‚•π?‚•πpresented with that screen
if your name was "cy from gunicorn"
what would you do‚•πclick it‚•πclick what‚•πuse current name‚•πi see
ok
this was unclear before‚•πidk i cant think anymore‚•πbecause the lowest button said "Play Video"
so ppl thought‚•πi think doing hw while listening to music is bad‚•πto click play video
not
"use current name"‚•πhuh‚•πmath, science, yes. English, history, seminar, no.‚•πhistory with music is doing me wonders
idek what i have typed
in my notes‚•πif we joined a voice call
would akhil join‚•πidk maybe
u wanna join?‚•πill ask my parents in a few minutes‚•πI can‚•πcool
okay we might then
i just want this h*ckn nix vm to work
then I will get up‚•πencourage ramesh to join a voice call‚•πand ask my parents
IT WORKS
NIXOS FINALLY WORKS
also
I can join
a voice call‚•πjoin‚•πok‚•πit no work
my mic
broke
can you hear me‚•πno‚•πBye‚•πbye
i got it
to work
which is good‚•πnote to self: offload caddy data dir to nfs mount‚•πserver details

maybe
theres a

can you please
set up an iperf for me
so I can see how fast the upload speed is‚•πwhat do you want again‚•πset up a cheap server or wahtever‚•πon my nextcloud server?‚•πno
on your vultr‚•πno‚•πwhy‚•πi have limited egress
and ingress‚•πhow much is the limit‚•π500GB‚•πyes‚•πand my dad is funding this‚•πim not doing‚•πfor one purpose‚•π500GB
of data‚•πi have gigabit
at home
first try that‚•πsee this is‚•πalso i dont think the vultr is fast enough‚•πwhat is your iperf
to vultr‚•πto do more than like 700mbps
idk i just got it
i dont even have an ssh key‚•πk fine
ill talk later thaen‚•πwhat is mtr‚•πsome like
packet size or something
idk
i was looking into it
no
that might be mtu
anyway I have work to do
bye‚•πhaha nvm‚•πIm wut‚•πon my vultr‚•π2 gigabit speeds‚•πyes‚•πIm done‚•πthat was like
the fastest
speedtest
i ever saw‚•πIm done‚•πit was like
u blink‚•πIm done‚•πand its done‚•πI give up
Im over here
With 40 mbps‚•πno this is a vps‚•πOh okay
Still
Thats fast‚•πa $3.50 vps
the cheapest out there
im spekked out
just me, myself, and my one cpu core
how many gunicorn workers should i run‚•πYes‚•πthey reccomend 2-4
per cpu core
i think imma do 2
do i put my site in /var/www
imma not
its a pain
is officially
online
and fully secure
and
has ddos protection
with Cloudflare‚Ñ¢‚•πalso‚•πcy is mad‚•πfeaturing extra slowness‚Ñ¢‚•πit is not
working
go to the site
then click
new share‚•πstops
working
vultr slow‚•πno
it goes‚•πit doesnt load‚•πwhich is the ip of the gunicorn instance‚•πI use gunicorn
and nginx
for emotes‚•πtell me then
how you got this
not to happen‚•πI set the URL
like‚•πthere is a way to not have this issue‚•πim seeing
idk
try a reverse proxy‚•πwhat are all those headers
for‚•πsubdomain routing‚•πi am mad
this is not a thing‚•πwait
im thinking why‚•πgo to that
thats like
literally
what i have
except im on 81
wait
no its not
what i have
i do not reference a wsgi file‚•πyes
try a reverse proxy
and add those headers
try installing nginx or caddy‚•πi am using
nginx‚•πI think‚•πwell but its also doing ssl‚•πyes
caddy automatically
does letsencrypt‚•πk the headers fixed the issue
i should use caddy‚•πyes
sadly I cannot use caddy
i mean I can it'll just be pointless‚•πi want rate limiting
on my site‚•πyes caddy
has that
as a plugin‚•πbut is it per-ip
the thing is this
nginx has that
through a not-plugin
like‚•πthink about‚•πnatively‚•πthe number of times‚•πthere is a directive‚•πnginx has given you
a headache‚•πmany
many
times‚•πSame
unfortunately I have to use varnish
since my vpn is bad‚•πwhy
oh
the thing is this
cloudflare
will do rate limiting
but
its a pay per request‚•πnvm
caddy has it built in‚•πno but
if you want it
by ip
you have to do it at the top level
which in this case would be cloudflare
that said‚•πno this has by ip‚•πthey
no but
to caddy
it would all be coming from cloudflare
so its all one ip‚•πwait
really?‚•πyes‚•πlkasjfdl;kjaf;ljasdfl;kjsaf‚•πif ur using cloudflare proxy‚•πa;sdlfa;sldfk
alskdjfl;asdf;lsakjfl;safj
*sigh
okay‚•πthe thing is
cloudflare
"charges"
its $0.05
per
10,000
requests‚•πPerhpas
I also have homework to do though‚•πalso the thing is
my app
requres
lotsa requests
mainly what i need
is just database rate limiting
or size-limiting‚•πTry haproxy‚•πlike registering a client has to have a delay
or also
i could use
recaptcha
recaptcha v3‚•πIf you want‚•πim already using recaptcha
i think
a user
just cannot exceed
like
1000 "shares"
and you require a recaptcha score of 5 or higher to view the shares
meh
ill wait
till it breaks‚•πyes do that
i have to do work
eventually‚•πk‚•πI will do this‚•πwhy not use cloudflare
are you using cloudflare‚•πbecause
I cannot forward optimum ports
I think of it as a security risk‚•πwait
what is this for‚•πill explain later
bye‚•πbye
vultr is still not working
im getting sick
of this
goddammit mongo db
why
why
mongodb
is breaking
why
cy is mad
haha lol
i forgot
you have to
tell mongodb Atlas
to let in certain IPs
or else it will block them‚•πFinally got the hack I gosh fully working POG‚•πah
he has
a mak
im like
fighting
with mongodb
and nginx
and vultr
and cloudflare
and certbot
and flask‚•πThe Mac‚•πand gunicorn
üçé‚•πPut sticker on it so it would blend in‚•πI have a hackintosh too
I gave up on it‚•πThink anyone will notice?‚•πNope, no one‚•πramesh
i think
it actually
works now‚•πThis was the most painful thing I have tried to do‚•πyes
installing lunix‚•πZ390 boards need to die‚•πwould have been easier
uhm
did you use opencore?
how'd you make it work‚•πYeah used opencore
I was having problems with it restarting randomly and the solution was in the postboot guide at the very end‚•πdid you make imessage work?
with the like
setting the ID or whatever
i forget‚•πIdk it kinda just worked automatically‚•πAHHH‚•πI didn‚Äôt need to do anything‚•πI spend hours trying to get imessage to work
ASFLKJlj‚•πMy iCloud just linked to it‚•πimma try it then‚•πi just did a vm
i just need apple for development purposes
so i can test‚•πBut rn I can‚Äôt get it to display on multiple monitors‚•πI did this‚•πhi my name is cy
I do maths
and I know
that 0.02+0.04 != 0.04
it has a
dark theme‚•πThis is the reason I can't continue with MultiHangman at th emoment
I mean I can it's just that I can't‚•πshould I?‚•πSure
Go for it
Live life‚•πYes do it
if not you can disable it later‚•πyes
idk if I even have ipv6 support here tho‚•πtry it‚•πno
it doesnt
work
theres no ipv6 yet
Verizon is
"testing"
it
in like
virginia
wait
for ipv6
do both the server and the client
have to support it‚•πYes
Both must support ipv6‚•πI see
does your linode
have ipv6
yes it does
vultr has ipv6
as an option
a free option
so I selected it
im just wondering like
what could i do
with a vps
that only has ipv6‚•πHurricane electric is interesting‚•πwhy are there no power outage apis
this is an injustice‚•πwhy do you need one‚•πto monitor power outages in the area‚•πfor yourself?
or as an app‚•πyes for myself‚•πthe just use like
the websites
provided
by service providers‚•πbut i wanna use an api‚•πhi i like my vultr
*sigh
time to add
more
rate limiting
i have
paranoia‚•πwhat about
2fa‚•πmeh
not needed for this
overkiill
in fact
this service
was going to just be like‚•πoauth?‚•πno accounts
you just
make a share
and then
share it‚•πsign in with google‚•πi could
but
*sigh
ill add that to cygn-in v2‚•πCygn in with MyKettl‚•πno
only i
can use
Cygn in
you get the
sign in‚•π*cygh‚•π*cysicygh‚•πcy sigh
Mesh Net
RaMesh Net
yes
it's free
and good‚•πdo they do serverless
no idc anymore
im just using
vultr‚•πtbh
i still dont understand how you got the word serverless
it is not
without a server‚•πit is
it is without
a server
and it is
a thing‚•πwth is this website‚•πif im not managing a server
its serverless‚•πyou are.‚•πno im not‚•πIt is simply someone else's server.‚•πthey are
its like‚•πso they are installing playtools then‚•πyes‚•πi get cloud computing
i dont get‚•πi give them playtools‚•π"serverless"‚•πthey host it
theres no gunicorn
or nginx
or any of that
they deal with it all
they scale it all
so like
instead of upgrading your vps
you just
do
nothing
it just
scales‚•πbing bang boom‚•πyes
literally
no joke
cuz there is no server‚•πok
i get it
but imma call this PaaS‚•πsure
wait
what are the aas's‚•πas a service‚•πno
like
what are they
theres
IaaS
PaaS
SaaS
vps is IaaS right‚•πinfrastructure as a service
platform as a service
software as a service‚•πidk
anyway‚•πI think
idk‚•πserverless might have been nicer
although
idk
i could go with google
but im just worried like
if something goes wrong‚•πLock-in has entered the chat‚•πthe platform is so complicated
that like
trying to fix anything
trying to understand billing
is hell
Heroku‚•πis what you would call
"serverless"‚•πbut i was like meh
well
theres also cloudflare workers
but those arent really a hosting platform
also
vultr
vps
will let me install mongodb locally
if i want to
so that's an advantage‚•πyes
mongodb is nonfree software‚•πno theres a community edition‚•πSSPL
is not open-source‚•πwhat is sspl‚•πserver side public license
if you host mongodb
you have to open source
as a service‚•πopen source what‚•πeverything
that
you use to manage mongodb
and that integrates with it
in any level
or way‚•πum
how would they know tho‚•πyou make mongodb server
for usage for others
idk someone tells them
just like you can report gpl violations‚•πno one access my mongodb
only i do‚•πyes
but idk‚•πlike
if i didn't tell you
you wouldnt know‚•πWhats been happening here?‚•πyes
if i stole your code
and you didnt konw‚•πbut you cant
steal‚•πis it okay‚•πmy code‚•πi can‚•πsince its closed source‚•πSspl
Means it gotta be open source‚•πthere imma steal this‚•πthat doesn't use mongodb‚•πidc
from mongodb's perspective
it is okay to violate their license?‚•πidk what their license is‚•πfine you make a good point
just like
i think it's fine to violate the apple EULA
since it's unethical‚•πI mean u shouldn‚Äôt
I mean u shouldn‚Äôt‚•πwhere‚•πidc about apple though‚•πdoes it say
that its sspl‚•πIts mongodbs like license
They made it‚•πthis
is why i do not use mongodb‚•πi see‚•πI would rather not depend
on nonfree services
so I will deal with postgres or mongodb
or
if I want a NoSQL
CouchDB‚•πmeh
ill just stick with atlas‚•πalso
another reason you should try NixOS
nixops lets you manage remote nix installs as wel
so if I have 5 rpis
I can just manage them with one code repo‚•πwait actuallY/
also idk if u know but u can make a vm of nixos
like whatever system u have currently‚•πyeah I know
I saw it somewhere
but it's only for testing‚•πyea‚•πno
sspl
does not
apply
to me‚•πit doesn't
but
it depends on a program‚•πi am not selling mongodb as a service‚•πthat is not in the repostiries
in lunix
because that program
is
"nonfree"
to them‚•πwhy is it nonfree‚•πSSPL‚•πSSPL is very reasonable
no dont take my software‚•πno‚•πput a fancy layer on top of it
and then‚•πthen it's not open source
it's source-available‚•πclose source everything‚•πMaybe
Just maybe
you should look up
AGPLv3
and see what that does.
then look up the difference‚•πidc much about these licenses‚•πbetween AGPLv3 and SSPL.‚•πif they dont affect me‚•πJust give everything an MIT license
Thats what i do‚•πwhat is the MIT license‚•πFree open source
Everybody can use
No warranties or liabilities‚•πbut what about use in other services‚•πEverything goes‚•πI see‚•πI will be licensing emotes under AGPLv3
I don't want people to steal it
It is a good idea‚•πDoes github have a AGPl license?‚•πgithub
is closed source
gitlab is like‚•πNo i mean
Does it have an option to license ur project with AGPL‚•πprobably
likely
you would be surprised
at how many licesnses
gitea has
that is if it stops crashing‚•πNice‚•π389 is an LDAP server
hay cy‚•πno
not native
Mattheiu is typing‚•πIs there no tech club today?‚•πwait
idk
oh its an abbreviated day
technically‚•πSo no club?‚•πi guess not‚•πOk‚•πk one more rate limit to put in
playtools
might
actually
be ready
it has a captcha every 4 times someone tries to view a share
i think
its fully sealed
i just need to verify that the api is sealed
and the playerUpdate API
wait
it might be
done
now
hmm
lol i have like 18 tabs open in firefox
and like 70 open in edge
and about 90 in chrome‚•πwho is Karina‚•πa Student‚•πwho is Aryan‚•πa Student‚•πwhat is JSON‚•πa Student
hoi oim bri <stop> ish‚•πhoi
jpo‚•πplaytools is done
it works
and it cannot be spammed‚•πoh NOW it wants to work‚•πits a Jason file‚•πor not
the bot is still dead
Why is GCP so buggy‚•πwdym
also
vultr's speed test is like
a file‚•πim installing iperf on a gcp‚•πon the free one?‚•πYes‚•πi see
dont expect that much
also
expect to incur charges‚•πwhy
i have 300 dollars
of free credit‚•πwell then no‚•πand I used
zero of it
so far
this is like
better than linode‚•πi used $0.36 of mine‚•π*slightly‚•πwait
between what and what
is 5mbps‚•π1 sec
it's from my computer to linode
linode is the iperf server
see‚•πbut
i think
that's an
optimum
issue‚•πYes it is
but the thing is‚•πso i dont think
linode vs gcp
is relevant‚•πIt is
one sec
I will demonstrate‚•πum
what
how does
how do
you get
6mbps
to a cloud service provider‚•πSee this is what I'm not sure on‚•πi think its cuz speedtest does parallel connections‚•πill try‚•πwith WebSockets‚•πiperf with parallel
Hmm
Yes‚•πthat's interesting
cuz like
wget
like‚•πthat is download speed‚•πdirectly to my vultr
one connection
its max speed‚•πYou get 250mbps‚•π120 MBps‚•πover iperf
to my
linode‚•πdo i?‚•πYes‚•πwait‚•πyou can do it again‚•πare you sure?‚•πlemme
set it up‚•πi have gigabit‚•πit's‚•πwait
ramesh
does iperf
do
which way
client to server‚•πit can go both ways‚•πor server to client
no by default‚•πclient to server‚•πso upload‚•πyes‚•πlemme run ur iperf command‚•πyes‚•πits hanging‚•πoops
wait
try now‚•πhuh‚•πNow
run
that command with
-P 20 -w 128K -V‚•πwhat does that do‚•πat the end
parallel‚•πso 1gbps‚•πYes‚•πlemme try single to vultr‚•πyes
Linode is 1.5Gbps with speedtest-cli‚•πdown or up‚•πdown 1500
up 1372
linode gud‚•πvultr is
2500 down
1300 up‚•πI cannot get vultr
can i iperf your vultr‚•πthis was single to vultr
hold on
yeah and my multi to vultr was 1gbps‚•πinteresting
now let me try‚•πlol‚•πso like compraable
to linode
aws was actually 1.52‚•πwithin margin of error‚•πyes‚•πwait‚•πso I will get no benefit here‚•πwhat about iperf
to my house‚•π30 probably
try it
you have to open tcp port 5201‚•πlemme open port 5201‚•πI was thinking I could VPN to your house and then you can VPN to my VPS and then I can get it to work
this is silly‚•πregardless of anything
you will always be speed limited‚•πyes‚•πalso‚•πi wont
do that
since privacy concerns
and stuff‚•πi already have 5201 open on the pi‚•πOkay‚•πso we try that‚•πwhat is the IP
hmm‚•πdo multi‚•πHmm
scam‚•πwhat is scam
wait
it was like
36 mbps‚•πmulti
now how can I take "multi"
and put it into my VPN setup‚•πwhat was this compared to
all the rest‚•πlike
slightly worse‚•πi see‚•πyou were 5.17mbps
and vultr/linode was 6.2 ish‚•πhow about multi
also
how much transfer
did linode give you
and how much are you paying them‚•πidk‚•πper month‚•πnone
i used the free trial
i get 100 dollars of credit‚•πok but like
you have a vps
what does it cost‚•π5 dollars‚•πok
so 1tb transfer
1gb ram
25gb storage‚•πidk
no‚•πi have 512 MB
and 10 gb ssd
but i pay $3.50
per month‚•πhmm‚•πhmm what
wait whaddaya host on Linode
and how much RAM does it use
and can i eat the part you are not using‚•πwdym
you want to use my linode?‚•πno
i wanna know
how much ram
you use
to run your service‚•π115 mb‚•πI see
im using 240 mb rn‚•πthe amount used may go up a lot eventually
cuz varnish‚•πwait
this is emotes
right‚•πno
it's
my reverse proxy‚•πah‚•πvpn thing‚•πhow much does emotes use‚•π365M‚•πah
also
you use Gunicorn‚•πyes
uwsgi is‚•πhow many workers
do you set‚•πidk
the default‚•πso 1‚•πshould I add more‚•πdoes your app support doing that‚•πprobably‚•πdoes it store local variables‚•πwdym‚•πlike‚•πall programs do‚•πno local to the instance
global to your program
but local to the instance‚•π‚Ä¶ yes‚•πfor what
cuz you see
my only "local" variable is viewsWithoutCaptcha
which is a non-vital variable‚•πI like
I still don't understand‚•πok
so
can it be
horizontally scaled
that's another way to put it‚•πwhat does that mean‚•πok it means this
you can have 2 servers
running
the same software
and i can ask either of them
any time
randomly
and both are sure to give me a valid response‚•πyes
uhm
no‚•πso if i login
with one server
i can just
go to the other one
and ask for data
and it will give me it‚•πno
emotes does not do that‚•πPlayTools does do that‚•πunless like
the database configuration is the same‚•πno
they share
a database‚•πthen yes
and it has to share the same file mount‚•πhold on‚•πah
i fixed emotesbot
yes
emotes will do that
for the most part‚•πthere was like
a really nice diagram
and i cant find it
and i am sad
This
yes.
this‚•πYes
what about it
it looks fine
I have made these before for myself‚•πit is the nice diagram
with alla the parts
Triangle is gonna have many of them‚•πYes
my current system has many of them
imma make one‚•πincluding the Collaboration Server‚•π"what if disney princesses were cement mixers?"‚•πcy has left the chat‚•πwhat
why‚•πhe is back‚•πima set up a wiki
eventually‚•πwhat is that
is that ur network‚•πno
it's a drawio template‚•πi should draw a diagram of my network‚•πyou should
imma make a wiki
called boringwiki
in like 10 minutes‚•πhow should i draw the diagram‚•πin rust
or visio
this isn't quite right
Yes
the media has now forgotten what telegram is
and now everyone will think
telegram is a far-right social media platform‚•πim almost done with my diagram
hi welcome to cy's network‚•πnow this is interesting‚•πyes
it is
hi im a raspberry pi
and im using
of ram‚•πyes
I
Really detest varnish‚•πwhat do you think of my network diagram‚•πIt is
very interesting
as in that it's more interesting than mine at the moment‚•πmy network is literal spaghetti‚•πThat is good
also
eventually
and like the tech blog as well maybe‚•πsee everything on my network gets routed through HAProxy
except Mosquitto and OpenVPN‚•πwhy openvpn
why not wireguard‚•πidk i tried wireguard
and it didn't work
and OpenVPN is good enough
i just need it for those times
when you have to manage infrastructure
from far away
like
calum calls me
hes like
cy‚•πI tried OpenVPN‚•πi wanna work on the wiki‚•πit was a nightmare‚•πpivpn
is not
a nightmare‚•πk nvm
i dont
pi
i use nixos‚•πand im in the car‚•πit takes like 5 lines of code‚•πand its like
ok...
and so
i pull out the VPN
and connect
also
pivpn supports wireguard
i just
havent needed it yet‚•πHmm interesting
Also
I was thinking of something dumb‚•πwhat‚•πnvm
it has nothing to do with this‚•πwhat is it‚•πI wanted to assess how someone would react if I randomly told her "I love you" even though I don't
For the sake of social science‚•πgo right ahead
without my affiliation‚•πyes
i mean the thing is
wireguard is easy to set up but then it's like also a pain
once you figure it out it's easy‚•πidk it just‚•πthen when you go to fix it it's a pain‚•πi tried it
and
it didnt
work
at all‚•πit was faster
than openvpn‚•πyes
i hear
its like‚•πim making a diagram‚•πand
when you hover
over the logo
it animates‚•πvultr
tony vultr‚•πits david aninowski
he grew up in new jersey
and went to NJIT
then‚•πand founded vultr‚•πdecided
to make vultr‚•πyes‚•πdid you hear
jeff bezos‚•πyes
I heard‚•πi heard him too
the sound
was one
i did not expect to hear‚•πI didn't
mind‚•πim just happy cuz like
Panos
is now in charge of windows
and Panos
cares
about how things look‚•πi do not care
how things look‚•πtesla
is apple
but‚•πcars‚•πwell also
they share
technology‚•πat least‚•πi mean
apple has no technology‚•πelon has a sense of humour‚•πto share‚•πapple
does not
I have
heard that one
before‚•πdo you know
how i2c works‚•πno
stop‚•πi2c
is fun‚•πthis one is slightly funny‚•πyes‚•πThis is like
the future‚•πthis is‚•π...
Haha
this one IS good‚•πget it?‚•π‚Ä¶
yes‚•πthis is like‚•πfunny
also caddy will get replaced with haproxy‚•πi see
next up on the list
UDP streams
for video
what if
i end up making a video chat app
before i make Triangle
what if Triangle has video calling‚•πi was
thinking of making
a voice chat server
with UDP sockets‚•πno video is way cooler
the problem is that like
no UDP in a browser
so ur stuck with TCP
hmm
video call over WebSockets‚•πoh no‚•πactually
websockets
are not that bad
but
WebRTC
is also a thing
which allows you to do RTC over a UDP link in a browser
wait
hold up
hold up
WebRTC
is actually p2p
so like
if we wanna connect
my browser
would establish a link
to yours
directly
well with a server to facilitate the connection
but
the actual data
is being transmitted
p2p
with a relay backup in case the p2p fails‚•πidk
im like
busy‚•πthis is really cool
im definately learning about this next‚•πnixos is cool
if I want to add my public key
I just
wait for it
"calligraphy"‚•πcy is still lost
about
webRTC
how does
one
just
"connect"
with a peer
cuz if that is truly how this works
then how do group chats work over webRTC
and also
if that's how it works
i can really cheaply and easily
make
a low latency, high quality, free real time sharing service
since i process no data‚•πmaybe
I have no clue here
ramesh is still nixosing‚•πyes‚•πhpX
ignore this‚•πhi ramesh
do you wanna get on a voice chat
and chat‚•πI uh
did that with akhil‚•πlol‚•πAnd then closed telegram
since telegram voice chat bad‚•πExpressJS‚•πOh no‚•πjk‚•πI predicted it‚•πi might use it at some point‚•πWatch‚•πor websockets‚•πYes
flask-websockets‚•πalthough
i can just use
the python websockets module
but then the realtime server is separate from the main one
cuz the websockets module uses asyncio
and i only know how it works in that implementation
yknow whats fun
i think zoom
actually uses WebSockets‚•πvarnish is caching too zealously
i will deal with this later
wait also cy
try control-f5‚•πno its not slow
its fast‚•πYay
varnish go brrr‚•πPeerJS
is a server
for handling WebRTC‚•πcy
you know what‚•πcdknight: you know what‚•πyou know what‚•πcdknight: you know what‚•πhold on im emailing mr y‚•πwe need
inline
not cy
translator‚•πwhy tho‚•πso I can
translate stuff for akhil
the khiller‚•πbut like
why
is that
different
from just like‚•πcyfinfaza: from just like‚•πsince
the bot is not in our dms‚•πah
you want it
in a dm
but then like
you have to
do @bot
then
paste the message‚•πYes‚•πcuz it cannot see all the messages‚•πthat's fine by me
no
inline bot
bots can send messages on your behalf
text messages‚•πyes
but like
you can just like
do google translate at that point‚•πno‚•πalso
i dont think inline bots do messages
i think they do media‚•πi think they do
see how
this is text‚•πi see
but like
just
do‚•πno
ill make one then

it has

I want to see if it works‚•πyou can test
if you want
it doesn't have much spam protection‚•π„Åä„ÇÅ„Åß„Å®„ÅÜ‚•πits mainly protection on the db‚•πhow do I make a playtools

it's just like

it didnt
work
you have to make a playtools from the actual ui
or
from the api
either that or the bot has hit a rate limit
nope
the api works
i think
i havent tested it
but i dont care much about the api‚•πI must find a quote‚•πhold on i think theres still water in my mic *ppppfffftttt* *pppfffttt*
k i was worried u found it in normal user territory but u were in speshul user territory so its fine
k i was worried u found it in normal user territory but u were in speshul user territory so its fine
oh is it not working because i took out the ram and forgot to put it back in again
well i disagree with kevin
the other issue is that I don't have 2 fast laptops
but you must understand‚•π*cygh
it's the quote‚•πcy is updating windows atm

get the website

how does

make one‚•πso akhil can see‚•πi made one too‚•πits my network‚•πWhy is everyone making one‚•πcuz its what kool kidz do‚•πyes
:D‚•πWhat software?
Google draw?‚•πor whatever‚•πFine
there‚•πüëè
that's like‚•πyou are larger
than optimum
you can do it‚•πyes‚•πyes
note that there is no connection to the internet
thats on purpose‚•πlol
its starlink
on LTT‚•πi want‚•πactually tho
like
yes
u want‚•πi think i already signed up for the beta‚•πwell i mean i think you can actually get 5g internet here
hold on‚•πcough
there
not here‚•πum
there is tmobile 5g here
not verizon
although like
even 4g upload speeds
are faster
than optimum
like
i was with akash
and like
his upload
was
500 kbps‚•πyup‚•πbut on 4g‚•π1990s‚•πit was 20 mbps‚•πhaHAA‚•πso like
we just used
his phone
as hotspot
like
seriously
what is it
with this
wait
akhil
do they have poles
in the hills
or is it underground‚•πYay I got a 403‚•πakhil is walking to the window
to look
for poles‚•πwhat
like
polish people?‚•πno
not Poles
poles
if u no have poles
do not expect
fast internet
for a while‚•πwhat?‚•πtelephone poles‚•πunderground‚•πah yes
you see
and there is no fiber underground
in the hills
so
they need to install fiber‚•πyea thats kinda the reason‚•πand i think the hilliness of the hills
makes it hard
my dad told me about running fibers underground
cuz like
his business
is fibers
he makes
fibers
idk
wait
but then
what about
B days
wait
what‚•πIdk
Its under daily announcements on the website‚•πmeh
so that means
i dont go to skool
its rich rebuilds‚•πthis video is
fun
I recommend it
yes
I did that over winter break‚•πCleaning in progress...‚•πnice‚•πI think imma have to go further than this tho
To get all the dust and stuff out
Idk I'll see‚•πI like have barely any homework today‚•πsatisfaction
Optimum is stupid
So now i cant access router settings
Again‚•πi a, typppppign gfom a keyboard with no keys‚•πGood job‚•πi am now yestongo ot

tf
ive been doing this
since
2:45
th‚•πive been banging my head since 1‚•πabout what‚•πi wanna port forward
but cant‚•πthen be like ramesh‚•πand route everything through aws
i might have to‚•πor vultr
vultr is cheaper‚•πat that point i might as well just run the service on a vultr or aws thing‚•πwell
but if you need like
storage‚•πthats true‚•πor cpu
or
i mean
if u dont wanna pay much
you can use the free google vps‚•πyea i may have to do that‚•πthe thing is this
if you go for like
not aws
or google
or microsoft‚•πrn i might as well set up pfsense‚•πthe transfer fees are much different
like
vultr's $20/mo instance
gives you 3TB of transfer
per month
and‚•πhuh‚•π3TB of transfer
costs
$270
on aws
so you're effectively getting $270 worth of transfer
each month
and only paying
$20‚•πhuh‚•πand like
vultr's
$3.50/mo one
has 500gb
which is worth $47
on amazon
if you see where im going
but‚•πyea‚•πthe big three
charge less for compute
i believe
like
google
gives you it
free
literally
free
the $3.50 instance on vultr
only counting compute
is 100% free forever
on GCP
but
egress is $0.12 per GB
additionally
the big 3 do not charge for ingress
so cut those numbers in half
because vultr includes ingress
in your allowed budget
so for your application‚•πHuh‚•πyou're only getting $23 worth of transfer
on the $3.50 vultr
but
that's still
really good‚•πYea‚•πthat said
like
check how much transfer you use
cuz if you dont use that much
use the google f1-micro
which is the completely free one
cuz like
if you use less than 29.16 GB per month
its more cost effective‚•πyea its def more than that‚•πhow much
what is the purpose‚•πrn i need pfsense and an email server‚•πwhat is pfsense‚•πits like firewall/router stuff‚•πwhat does it do
and why is it so data intensive‚•πthats not the intensive
if i run my server through gcp its prob gonna go over 30 gb‚•πwhy tho
how does an email server
use more than 30 gb‚•πthis is my entire server so thats torrents, music‚•πwdym your entire server
you are hosting
torrents
and music‚•πif i do what ramesh does
^
if i actually just host an email server on gcp its probably gonna be fine‚•πlemme just say
according to cloudflare
in the past 30 days
of which were cached‚•πhuh‚•πso in actuality
only 2gb of transfer occurred to my server
so technically
if i hosted those on google
i would be paying
$0.12 per month
but instead i host them at home
and pay $0.00 per month
but u cant do that
but u get the idea‚•πYea
Idk im gonna try making this work
It worked before‚•πwhat
what work
optimum?‚•πAccesing my router settings
Yea‚•πk
although
i dont think they do port 25
but im not sure‚•πYea ik
But 587 works
Which is another smtp port
So it should be fine‚•πi see
ok
wait i take back what i said
you would actually get 1tb total transfer
since with a vpn
your ingress and egress would be almost equal
but they only charge for one
the higher one
on vultr‚•πfor gym
i picked
yi jian mei
and some kpop song
hey cy
do you have a docean droplet‚•πno
why‚•πi wanna
iperf‚•πbut like
hold on
wait
JP has one‚•πYes
I used to have access
SSH access to his‚•πjust ask him
to iperf‚•πHe stopped using it
A long time ago‚•πi see‚•πwe shut it down‚•πuse their speedtest tool‚•πthey like
dont have one right‚•πthey do‚•πI still have a backup of the database from our droplet‚•πwhat were you using it for‚•πenvoyez-moi
matrix server‚•πi see‚•πbtw
we are learning stuff in calculus
and it's like
telling me how people make CAD software‚•πand...?‚•πit's interesting
i could write my own‚•πi see‚•πwhat
like

scalpers
im allergic to biology‚•πyourself‚•πalso haha imagine ever taking an sat subject test‚•πi never did‚•πyou never did
i thought
you studied for it‚•πno
akhil maybe‚•πI never took biology
and this was during normal times
so I am lucky‚•πbiology was fun‚•πyes it was
i sat in the back‚•πprobably my best class
ever‚•πand read fiction books‚•πi got like an A
and i didn't study
at all‚•πI got like an A-‚•πand i was interested‚•πand studied only the night
before the test
they also made a rounding mistake
A- A- A- B- is actually a B+
but nooo they gave me an A- anyway‚•πum
they round up
always‚•πwhatever
this is a class‚•πAh
The famed A+
The unattainable‚•πyes‚•πIts real‚•πthe class where
I‚•πThe stories
The legends
They were true‚•πThe class
where my final average was this
in 9th grade‚•πAh‚•πseminar‚•πThe famed B+‚•πlol APCSA‚•πoh
I got like a 99%
lol APC‚•πThe famed APCS

Seems nice‚•πalso google gives you $300 free credit‚•πGuess im with google‚•πtheres nothing there
i need a domain
what do i choose‚•πy
do you need another domain
if someone wants another domain
now i must haproxy with intelligence‚Ñ¢‚•πalso vultr is on speedtest‚•πoh‚•πbut its not as fast on speedtest as it is with iperf‚•πlemme see
i have to install it

that upload speed is a lie

except
its not china
west

hmm
idk any westbrooks
i only know a cy eastriver‚•πu spelt ur name wrong
Haha
was about to make the same joke‚•πcy is very tired
he like
had to walk
for an hour
in the snow
hes sorta dizzy now
cyze at komp cy‚•πyes
i saw‚•πa keel is not‚•πi will be‚•πy'know
i left
because my parents are arguing too loudly
and I don't feel like sitting here when my parents are arguing‚•πmay i ask
why
werkzeug
is better
than Gunicorn‚•πyou are
comparing
apples to oranges.‚•πif i spam my gunicorn server
on vultr
it dies
and hangs
if i spam my werkzeug server
on my pc
but through cloudflare‚•πah
it's because‚•πit just like
doesnt
hang‚•πyour computer
is not a potato vps‚•πok but im monitoring the cpu and ram usage of the vps
the cpu never goes over 20%‚•πram?
disk?‚•πand the ram has gone down
over the course of this test‚•πuhm
what does gunicorn say
make more workers idk‚•πi have 2 workers
on flask i have threaded=True
for werkzeug‚•πadd like
10 workers
see what happens‚•πim testing things‚•πI wish
my VPS
ran NixOS‚•πwhy cant it‚•πit's a pain
to set it up again
i dont wanna use up my credits
i mean if I do
cant i just make another account‚•πwhy not use vultr‚•πozarka
it
refuses
cards
Ozarka
nope‚•πi wanted to use pointers‚•πit wont work‚•πbut
no
it works‚•πthat is not a pointer
rust does not have pointers‚•πyes
it is not‚•πrust only has references‚•πa pointer‚•πwhat is a pointer again‚•πan address‚•πis it like a mutable reference‚•πin memory‚•πyes
but references are also that
right‚•πidk
i dont use references
i gtg bye‚•π*sigh
bye‚•πif anyone is still awake
i have lost my mind
*i think
yup
i had lost my mind
it said
and i read
so they changed it to "Apple"‚•πMy computer refuses to let me log in
Which is a bad‚•πOof
Its snowing
Hard‚•πYes but my computer wont work‚•πwhy‚•πI fixed it
without doing anything‚•πms tan says
she would
"gladly use"
cydingbat‚•πMake it‚•πit may be time‚•πI could also collaborate if you want‚•πyes
a collaboration
always good
2x speed
well more like 1.75x speed cuz theres coordination overhead‚•πYtteribum
Itterbium‚•πhmm
how would we go about
making
codingbat
i think you just make a user
that cant
access anything
then you use Microsoft Monaco‚•πuhm
I would use docker‚•πno but
what if‚•πYes‚•πlike
with python
someone runs‚•πyou cant escape a docker cy‚•πos.system("rm -r")‚•πit cant‚•πmy point is this
they could‚•πDocker cant delete the OS‚•πI finally made‚•πbreak the docker‚•πhaproxy work
then you make a new one‚•πbut like‚•πhealth check‚•πthey can keep breaking it‚•πrate limit them‚•πno
you need
a way
to have them be unable to access anything‚•πill think about it in a bit‚•πum‚•πi have
apush‚•πlike go into coding bat and try and break it
it doesn't break
lol codingbat just blocks the import command
wait
wait
hold on
what if
we used
webassembly
yes
cuz you know you can make webassembly compilers
python has a webassembly runtime
so whats to say java cant have one
hmm‚•πyes
but no
that is a pain‚•πyes
but then
how
im looking for implementations
and i cannot find‚•πdont do that
use replit
good luck implementing swing
with wasm‚•πi mean heres the thing
how to run code on a server
hi ppl
how do you do‚•πi do‚•πi do too
ramesh‚•πhi‚•πdo you wanna make a codingbat clone with me‚•πYes
in rust‚•πi mean
what part of it
would be rust‚•πthe container manager‚•πbut like‚•πthen I will make a python api‚•πalso‚•πand you can then
wrap over it‚•πalso‚•πmy rust thing will be like‚•πlook at codinbat
see how fast
the code runs‚•πyes I know‚•πi think
its interpreted
not compiled
in codingbat‚•πno
import rustlib

output = rustlib.execute(java_code)‚•πum
ok...‚•πto do checks
you could like pass a closure
output = rustlib.execute(java_code, lambda x: execute_right_function(x))
but then you have to write the answers in python
output = rustlib.execute(java_code, correct_java_code, test_inputs)
idk something like this
does python have this
this would make this VERY easy
you could run j4rs in a docker container
hmm
idk
i like rust‚•πi think
if you disable the ability to import
anything
but like
math‚•πI don't want that
I want docker‚•πand arraylist or whataver‚•πso you can do whatever you want‚•πramesh
what if
someone
breaks
the docker‚•πhow
tell me
how‚•πby running a command
that breaks it‚•π1) you can restrict the interpreter
and prevent them from running anything
if they find a way around that
you kill the docker container
and spin it up again
it takes like 2 seconds‚•πwhat if someone else is in it
compiling code‚•πit
makes
a
new
container
for
everyone‚•πbut like
isnt there
overhead
per container‚•πalso you don't have to use docker you can something lighter
not much
docker is rather light‚•πi should learn about docker‚•πtry podman or something
or you could literally use chroots
there are lots of solutions‚•πyes‚•πoh also
disable networking‚•πIts lighter if u add alpine into it‚•πno‚•πIdk how to do that yet‚•πeven ligher‚•πIve seen podman
I wanna see what it‚Äôs about‚•πmy problem is that i have no place to test something like docker‚•πi do‚•πUr computer‚•πmy desktop
since it runs lunix‚•πi have 600 mb of space
on my desktop‚•πtry it on a server
pis can run docker‚•πbut my pi is running everything else‚•πU can def get an nginx container up‚•πi could get like a vm
in virtualbox
and run stuff there‚•πI mean u could‚•πi could boot into Linux
but that's a pain‚•πyeah do that‚•πits a pain tho
i have to like‚•πMake sure u get compose‚•πi think a chroot might work‚•πi think so too‚•πDocker by itself is nice, compose makes it better‚•πalso what about jvm
or whatever‚•πKvm?‚•πno
jvm
java virtual machine
or whatever‚•πno
jvm has access to the overlying system‚•πcan i boot my linux ssd as a vm‚•πI think it would be easy to use like podman
yes
use hyper-v tho‚•πhow‚•πadd it as a disk‚•πhmm‚•πto your vm‚•πi would have to enable hyperv‚•πyes do this
also I think we could make a reallllly light podman with no networking or shell access
and then run all the processes
if they do "rm" it will throw a command not found‚•πi see‚•πAnd
you can have like runtime containers
so the containers dont actually story code
so if someone actually does destroy the container somehow
it will just send it to another runtime contianer
therefore you dont need hundreds of containers
and then you load balance the different containers
we might have to write this in go
this
exists
you can literally configure it
at the JVM level
theres probably more
loading
loading‚•πcy is getting a headache‚•πwhy‚•πwebassembly
is being
a pain
in the tukkus
its like
the kode is there
but its like
no
you cant
do anything
cuz its
more than 4KB
so
you have to run this function instead
so i run it‚•πthis wont work‚•πand it tells me
like
and i have no clue wtf that means
like
at all
cy is mad
the function runs
but
all
the values
are
0
*sigh
imma eat food‚•πmake
java
Cy do you want to make java‚•πWdym
You mean cydingbat?‚•πyes
but I have to write the backend backend
with docker
and then you can just build on that‚•πU will have to explain to me
How ur backend works‚•πI will‚•πI'm eating rn
Bye‚•πbye
I think I could make the runtime server work by today
It just has to compile the class
add it to the classpath‚•πwould you like to call‚•πand then exec it
yes
I can call you‚•πk
wait
just
one moment‚•πsure‚•πbrb‚•πbrb‚•πum
ok‚•πI like
actually got it to compile‚•πramesh
i can call for like
13 mins‚•πuhm
not no
also
you dont need to
liek
use javac‚•πwhat do you use‚•πReflect.compile‚•πwhat is that‚•πI'm looking
Use jOOR
You can add dependencies
to r4js
no
j4rs‚•πwhich should i use‚•πhavent used google dns
use cloudflare
ppl like it
wait
oh you mean
for dns resolution‚•πyea‚•πstill cloudflare
maybe with google as a backup
or your isp/router as a backup‚•πyea‚•πdoes chrome have this‚•πwhat
how‚•πedge is fun
im sad
that it doesn't
work
the fanciest button yet ‚Ñ¢
heretofore there has never been a button this fancy
periodic table but the elements are webassign checkboxes‚•πAh yes
We have a test on this stuff tmrw‚•πyes
i should
study‚•πIdk if its gonna be ez or hard
It looks like its gonna be ez
Ill check it out later‚•πyeah it no work on mobile
ramesh and i have been working on it
a lot‚•πI still
have to implement a custom class loader
ugh
no longer libreoffice
just libreoffice community‚•πWait when was that due‚•πToday
By the end of the day‚•πoops
i dont like it when teachers make homework due at odd times
like if its period 1-4
then sunday midnight ok
but like
per 5-9‚•πBruh u were supposed to have ur vid done on Friday tho‚•πand like dr p
makes things due like
saturday
midnight
right
ill do it
i have to do 3 things then tonight
French things, half the AP seminar TMP presentation, and science studying
also matthew‚•πTbf
Science is super ez‚•πyeah‚•πIts all on the periodic table
U could get a 100 without studying‚•πi mean
if i ask u
order these 3 elements by ionic radius:
Boron, Zinc, and Sulfur‚•πI dont have my table‚•πidk im too disorganized and distracted frankly‚•πBoron, zinc, sulfur
Isnt that the order
Smallest to largest‚•πi mean
boron sulfur zinc‚•πIm trying ti figure out how to read this chart‚•πi did the french
now that is done
i liked Sherice's response to what her ideal city would be
she said
myself
population of one
so i asked her how she was gonna connect to the internet
cuz what else would i ask
when someone says they wanna live secluded in the middle of nowhere
lol French not done
font is
different‚•πi accidentally
set my firefox global font
to lexend‚•πlol‚•πso now‚•πDM Sans / DM Mono‚•πwait let me find a way to cause an error‚•πis what i have CodeTools set to
lol
lexend‚•πyes
maybe imma change that
to something
liiiike‚•πand that's all it is
it says im maggie
and i could take a better one
finding the balance‚•πno there will not be an api‚•πi knwo
the font‚•πmeh‚•πmak
apple
meh
js
google wrote something in nix
nah it's not official
sad‚•πwho looked at CodeTools this morning‚•πme‚•πk‚•πy‚•πidk‚•πalso are you going to make codetools open source‚•πidk
perhaps‚•πYou should
people can like
contribute to it
if they have an incentive to
for example I could add vim keybinds support to monaco if I wanted to
which I probably do
Or if someone like finds a problem with it they can fix it for you‚•πthat is true
then my code has to look good
or else people will come‚•πI mean
you can improve it over time‚•πand hold me accountable
for bad code‚•πthey really won't‚•πlol ramesh‚•πI mean maybe this is since
Usually my code is pretty decent in quality
since I hold myself to an unusually high standard sometimes‚•πremember this conversation‚•πYeah
I mean
you should use an object relational mapper instead of manual mongo queries
or
well it's not relational but mongo still has an ORM‚•πidk this is my first time with databases
this template‚•πI have been doing databases since like 7th grade
but like
in a bad way
you could literally sql inject someone
and destroy their server‚•πyou cant sql inject me‚•πYeah
since you use mongo‚•πmongo injection‚•πbut my later SQL programs cannot be inecjted
like
emotes‚•πthe thing is
what im doing is working for me
although‚•πit can be a pain sometimes to sit and write queries‚•πobject relational mapper‚•πMongoid on ruby‚•πidk what is the advantage
how much more do i have to do
compared to how much
i save‚•πidk
for future projects
also what feature need to be added to codetools‚•πwdym‚•πlike
what features are missing from codetools‚•πright now?
like‚•πyes‚•πeverything?
other than writing and running
and even those are incomplete‚•πhaha‚•πthe thing is
you can write and run‚•πi think you should make‚•πbut like‚•πit
format the output‚•πnot safely
it needs rate limits
what i need
is an auto rate limiter
for my database
so i dont have to go and instate all the rate limits myself
so i could just like
add a rate limit property
but‚•πhaproxy‚•πi think
i can come up with a way
to do this
no
rate limits
like on playtools
on the my account page‚•πuhm
well I am not adding that to JRunner5 so you have to do it‚•πno imma do it
the rate limits prevent ppl from spamming
and filling the database
with nonsense
that way i can use the 500mb free cloud hosted mongodb‚•π*sigh
this is another problem with it
what if
I don't
want to use
the free cloud hosted mongodb‚•πwdym‚•πwhat if
I want‚•πthen dont‚•πto use my own mongodb instance‚•πthen install mongodb‚•πand then
edit the code?‚•πand switch the connection string
i mean you have to do that anyway‚•πso what are you going to do
when you put it on github‚•πreplace the connection string with <connection string>‚•πthen
what happens if you like
push it again‚•πtell ppl to make a mongodb‚•πit will get overwritten‚•πi could make it an environment variable or whatever‚•πyes
maybe you should do that
that's what emotes does‚•πwhats happening‚•πhi akhil
howdy do‚•πi took chem
es bueno‚•πready player two is good
read it‚•πok ok ok‚•πworth reading‚•πshould i read it
i read the first one‚•πi will after i get some projects finished up‚•πi will after i get my life finished up
i literally have like
0 time‚•πhow
ive been chillin‚•πi spend my time on like‚•πi have too‚•πCodeTools‚•πdoing homelab stuff‚•πyu[‚•πI may not work on JRunner5 more until later‚•πshould i just make them all ubuntu or try getting alpine to work‚•πget alpine to work
it is a pain
but it'd be worth it‚•πit is a pain
hmm ig‚•πor you could use‚•πthey are connecting
um
i mean
technically i could‚•πvultr works with nixos apparently‚•πshould I?
its kinda stupid to do it that way tho
its more like allocation at that point
i can
do it
its not hard at all
cause i have everything else set up
its just a matter of, will nixops keep the configuration when it is done?
cause i dont wanna keep doing the script over and over again
wait
this could work‚•πI  have to work
somehow
bye
try it‚•πcya
ill try it‚•πwhat does this do‚•πits a glitter pen
Mrs Baker really likes her glitter pen‚•πhaha
lol‚•πah
irony at its greatest‚•πdo you watch techmoan‚•πi do‚•πi do too
one of the few channels I watch‚•πI see
HAHA
i like that
video‚•πthere are more on that channel‚•πtime to watch
rich rebuilds
there is not enough racial diversity in what i watch
or gender diversity‚•πI mean
you just watch what you want
I don't really care about the diversity‚•πimplicit bias tho‚•πsince I don't have any‚•πand the algorithm
meh
implicit bias is really hard to deal with
but essentially
only watch what you like
and dont not watch something on the basis of race or gender‚•πwhy should i
im worried my parents will yell at me for watching women‚•πramesh‚•πhi
I know that's not true
I can't do anything about it‚•πno
ramesh
you must
not
*sigh‚•πour past observations dictate our current fears‚•πRich Rebuilds is good‚•πmm
also you tell me
nothing
almost nothing
interests me on youtube
I don't watch much there
so what exactly am I going to watch that concerns gender diversity‚•π^^timestamped‚•πI don't
car
especially not appl car‚•πits literally like
not that‚•πidk
I used to watch
these
things‚•πimma watcha video
bye‚•πmonospace‚•π?‚•πmonoscpace
it was not
monospace
before
right
or am I insane‚•πit was not
until
i changed
it
but only the solutions have changed
all the rest of the ui is still sans-serif‚•πdo not
use
monospace for UIs.
ever.
ok we are done‚•πthe ui
is not
monospace
its DM Sans
and the monospace is DM Mono‚•πdo you know how to tell if someone is french
online‚•πum
maybe‚•πjust see if they add spaces after question marks and exclamation marks‚•πah‚•πdo you do that
when typing french‚•πno‚•πje vois !
i know
i know it's not vois‚•πare you gonna do it?‚•πno
btw racism is a joke according to louis rossman
i like

Are you getting a new won‚•πno probably not
it was bork when we moved in
so we call a gie to fix it
so we kall the gie agen
hopefully the transformer is not
to the board
its an older dryer
well
older than the washer‚•πHaha‚•πi think the washer is like 2013 model or something
the dryer is 2006 i think
although idk what the deal is with this washer‚•πthat beeping noise
is slightly relaxing‚•πi like it
but i dont think its relaxing
that machine makes lots of other noises
that are more relaxing
like the one for turning off
or turning on‚•πAh right to repair
Thats an intresting topic‚•πtis‚•πCause honestly its kinda useless over here‚•πwdym‚•πRight to repair benefits certain people
Like farmers
Thats the best one i can think of rn‚•πthe deal with right to repair
is that
you should be able
to repair your stuff
when it breaks.
without going to the manufacturer
repair should be its own business
and companies are not allowed to monopolize it‚•πWell thats why farmers is the best party this affects‚•πnixvm
should be resistant
to rm -rf /*‚•πZedge‚•πf

lemme demonstrate
i apologize for sideways
one ui3
is fun
win dot, win v, win h
very useful‚•πwhy
is your keyboard
so large‚•πwin v is the best
i use it like
alla time
ery day
clipboard history
with no extra steps
needed
i have gotten used to like
copying something to clipboard
then overwriting it
and then
just using‚•πI‚•πwin v‚•π∆í‚•πhuh‚•πyeah but this requires no setup
its just like
win v
and it works for images‚•πi mean i dont ever overwright my clipboard
so is good‚•πit lets me copy 2 things
like if im on stackoverflow
and i want 90% of their code
but not the 10% in the middle‚•πi think images are supposed to work
but they don't‚•πalso it shows up right where the cursor is
which is nice
so its really fast‚•π∆í‚•πlets see what do i have for homework‚•πimagine
having so much hw
i have none‚•πi‚•πthat's just for 5-9‚•πhave a little‚•πi mean ill prob do apush notes
but yea‚•πa lot of my work is for AP sem
among other things
lemme try and finish it before 2am
i can work on CodeTools then
in fact what i should really do
is find the thing i least want to do
and do it‚•πformat
the output‚•πnixos is docker‚•πit is‚•πbut for an os‚•πliterally not
can you

I recomment
i have a reallly old verison of this
but it taught me everything
teakettl is now dark mode‚•πi do not
like
that
dark theme
its like

ill install it
you can write your own gitea themes‚•πwhere are themes‚•πi need this plex theme‚•πthat one's not bad‚•πidk how to download this‚•πgalaxy buds make a fun noise when they reach 0%
in class on zoom
with only the right earbud

ah the feature i was waiting for
in the dev tools
that shows you which codecs your headphones support‚•πAh
gitea is run by chinese companies

maybe you should varnish‚•πim using cloudflare
i think‚•πit takes a while
maybe
add this to codetools‚•πi think that's a you problem
it took me like
0 time‚•πit caches after the first load‚•πyes and i did the first load so‚•π^‚•πi would except like
its semi-broken in firefox‚•πit works for me
yes
no it is very broken‚•πidk why
actually its also broken in chrome
when you resize the window
i mean i made it in like 15 minutes
so like‚•πI feel like
Idk
i still haven't figured out my kettl design‚•πlol heres another problem‚•πhaha‚•πalthough i think i can like
find when the mouse leaves the page
and remove them
the main issue is that i need a div
that covers the whole screen
and that breaks for some reason
oh i think i know why
if you have one big div
that extends past the screen
and is set to align senter‚•πalso‚•πthen this middle div‚•πwhat software did you use
to make the cy2 logo‚•πInkscape‚•πÏû¨ÎØ∏ÏûàÏñ¥‚•πcyfinfaza: It is interesting‚•πit also means
that is interesting
or just
interesting‚•πI need to make this cursor a js library
that you can just like

wait
i know
how to do
what i want
to do‚•πcylib‚•πyes
that will become a thing‚•πwith
basicstyle‚•πyes
basicstyle
for the latest version
hmm‚•πyeah
it's not
fancy‚•πhi ppl
go to a website that does not have a security policy or whatever
then go to the console
and paste this:
oh also the site has to be dark theme
cuz the mouse only works with that rn
also you can add parameters to createFancyMouse()‚•πit like
glitches‚•πwhere are you‚•πffx‚•πsend link
oh you mean the pointer
reappears
wait no its when you scroll‚•πi wanna make the kettl homepage be like‚•πidk if you actually want it you have to make your site not break with it‚•πa ps2 menu
yes
exactly this‚•πthis has improved‚•πhi cy i think i broke playtools‚•πok...‚•πlemme
make a share‚•πum
you put spaces
as the username
and the title‚•πyes
dont you love that‚•πi mean
i assume
the teacher
will not do as you did‚•πcygh
i wonder what happens if I ddos playtools‚•πdont do that‚•πhow do i get to the api‚•πyou search for the screenshot
i sent‚•πcygh
nvm
im
i have work‚•πme too‚•πalso
were there any
codetools updates‚•πno‚•πk
are you going to like
show this to mrs. tan tomorrow‚•πi am‚•πi will be there two
since
I wrote some of it‚•πk
hi ramesh‚•πhi
i
slep‚•πi may show her it rn if no one stays in the main room‚•πhaha
do that
I will stay there two‚•πppl r like
not leaving‚•πyeah
i left
if you make codetools
open source
I would probably contribute
jfyi‚•πwait what did mrs tan tell you after i left‚•πum
nothing
i was talking to someone else‚•πk
what would you contribute
other than like
jrunner5
are you trying to tell me you would actually do web frontend‚•πmaybe
maybe I would do the backend stuff
the thing is I don't know mongodb‚•πthere is not that much backend stuff tho
its like
all one file‚•πI would see
what I could do
and maybe do some dumb fixes
small things that you can't get to‚•πpen-testing‚•πand maybe
just maybe
I would
format the output‚•πlol

in terms of projects this is like the one kinda fun one
im prob gonna replace a country
so its either the entire British isles, austria, poland, turkey or i might make a country between France and Germany engulfing belgium switzerland
if i make one toponyms is kinda easier
cause i have to just blend the regions cultures together‚•πinteresting

Thank god‚•πthing is i dont use vim or emacs
but i thought you terminal people would like to know‚•πIve been using vim
Its nice‚•πthe irony
the world is full of irony
‚ÄúThe Story of an Hour‚Äù by Kate Chopin is worthy of inclusion in the canon of great American literature, because it demonstrates the unseen opportunity that women may find unmarried, through beautiful use of imagery and irony.‚•πNice pun
Is it even called a pun?‚•πis trump gonna be banned from reelection‚•πIdk‚•πthese ppl are like
saying‚•πIve been drawing japan‚•πthat trump's lawyers were like
really incohesive
and rambling‚•πUm

bad‚•πtoday
i have like
5 hours of hw‚•πI do too‚•πbut i might actually get to like
work on CodeTools‚•πmm‚•πyou know what is also ironic
?
the fact that this weekend
i probably will be working on my homework at like
2am
on tuesday
i like french
ramesh
translate that
directly
wait
i wanna see what google says
Diffusion lanc√©e il y a 6 heures‚•πcyfinfaza: Broadcast started 6 hours ago‚•πok
oh my god google spell check in french
it like
gives blue lines
and when you correct it
it gives you a red line
because what it suggested
is wrong
so then it wants to switch it back to what it was
but then in doing that
it makes the blue line again
and then it starts recursively generating more squigglies
so when you fix one
5 more appear
and when you fix those
suddenly you spelled something wrong‚•πdamn
did u switch the doc language from english to french?
i usually have to switch it to spanish for it to worl‚•πno it auto switches which is nice

since its the 14th most visited site in the world
they can just like
put a ddos node in each client
and then have the clients perform ddos‚•πhuh‚•πon who they dont like‚•πthats smart‚•πits like
what PlayTools was doing
to itself‚•πah right‚•πapparently tho
Durov then left Russia and stated that he had "no plans to go back"[38] and that "the country is incompatible with Internet business at the moment".[37]‚•πgood job‚•πoof russia

idk how these charts work‚•πAh yes
Robinhood‚•πcuz like‚•πGME‚•πCBS sports or whatever has like 10M

but
YouTube has like 5B‚•πHuh‚•πi think these are just trends‚•πno
this is bad
why is AmongChat not higher
huh
so signals always been higher than telegram‚•πi think‚•πwait thats 2020‚•πthat
"signal"‚•πno one knows about telegram‚•πis a more popular term‚•πor that as well‚•πidk‚•πsee telegram has to do what reddit did
during the superbowl
reddit made a 5 second ad
it was awesome, but u couldnt read it
but that gets exposure‚•πi see
i just looked at it
"our whole marketing budget"‚•πdude ads are expensive‚•πreddit is made with Python‚•πsuperbowl ads go for like 4 million
really?
thats cool‚•πlol reddit dev tools‚•πholdup
how is reddits salary‚•πlol‚•πi dont think it will be much imo
like not as much as a software dev somewhere else
im thinking a solid 75k
ah vanish‚•πlol‚•πyes
i found a sheet of glass
it is the best thing ever‚•πwhat‚•πi found a sheet of glass
like good glass
its the glass from a scanner‚•πah
i have several scanners
that is nice glass
it is very
optically
clear‚•πikr
its so nice
ive been using it as a tracing thing rn
i set my phone light under the glass‚•πakhil üíö his piece of glass‚•πpaper above the glass
i can now trace things
with super nice accuracy‚•πI see
i have this like
lab glass window
its the nicest glass
its like a lens
but
it is not a lens
its just
glass‚•πyes‚•πand it has a matte finished chamfer‚•πthe world needs better glass‚•πwhat‚•πnice
am i seeing glass?‚•πits corning
they make glass‚•πit is awful‚•πno akhil
this is the only company
that is allowed
to use a such logo‚•πfine
i will allow it
cause they actually make some decent glass‚•πmy dad's company
they also make glass
my dad is like cy
i need to go pull a preform‚•πu mean
cy is like cy‚Äôs dad‚•πwait
what
wait
no‚•πthis‚•πhe brought a preform home once
it was a bad one tho i think
cuz preforms are really expensive‚•πthose r cool‚•πhe makes fiber
his company was trying to sell to verizon
this technology
that allows them to place 5G mmWave nodes
directly on suspended fiber cables
that way they dont have to buy property
they can just use the fiber cable property they already have
this one time my dad comes home and hes like
cy
I have been yelling all day
because I was at the furnace tower
and I had to yell to the person at the top‚•πoh god‚•πbecause the furnace is so hot it releases enough EMI
that no wireless comm works
and they were not gonna run ethernet up there‚•πhuh
interesante‚•πin fact
he had to yell
to a relay
who yelled
to the operator
my dad is interesting
he enjoys sitting and solving algebra
*standing‚•πah yes
huh‚•πmy mom got him a standing desk‚•πi wanted to build a standing desk‚•πlike a movable one?‚•πyea
motors and all‚•πactually
the non motor ones are more expensive
and better
cuz they go faster‚•πhuh‚•πwell for good ones‚•πlike slideing ones?‚•πyeah‚•πhuh‚•πcuz in order to hold lots of weight
and not use gearz
idk how they do it
they have standing desks at school‚•πi may look into it‚•πin the AP sem room‚•πand make one
i really wanna get a standing desk‚•πthe ones in the AP Sem room are mechanical
but they dont hold much weight‚•πi mean all the teachers have ‚Äústanding desks"
that are fixed‚•πno the ones in the AP Sem room are like
full on
standing desks
on wheels
and they
move
up and down
like the whole thing‚•πoh thats sick
not this
thats kinda eh‚•πalso
did I tell you‚•πi generally dislike anyhting on wheels‚•πthe school got new computers
then they took the monitors
and placed them upside down‚•πpls tell me they are good ones‚•πand they took the chairs‚•πtf?‚•πcuz ur not allowed to use them‚•πwhy?‚•πthey have like 9 or 10th gen core
and USB-C‚•πwhats the point of buying new ones then?
oh heck yes
are they dell optiplex?‚•πyes‚•πah‚•πI think they have a plan with dell‚•πyea school discount‚•πactually some of the rooms like the AP CS room
dont have monitors anymore‚•πhuh‚•πthey were doled out to the teachers‚•πssh/vnc into them‚•πno they are also unplugged
and the ethernet cables are like‚•πawww‚•πomg
in like
the biggest
disorder‚•πoh god‚•πi got one though at some point
and plugged it in
and got 1.2 gbps
to my laptop‚•πremember the computer we installed vnc server on?‚•πyes‚•πi think it may still work‚•πhow could i forget
akhil
it would still work
if it were on‚•πare they all just unplugged?
like all the comps?‚•πwait
holdon‚•πcause animations are on‚•πi just tried to reach it
and it told me
no authorize‚•πcause kids remote into them‚•πand i lost access to "A's Team"‚•πthats cause i removed u‚•πah‚•πi needed to add ramesh to get tech support‚•πhuh
aw
you dont have windows
with Quick Assist‚•πik‚•πQuick Assist is literally the best‚•πyea
that would have been nice
but he didnt vnc into my comp so its still useless
unless they get it on linix somehow‚•πQuick Assist?‚•πsomething along the lines
something better than vnc
cause vnc is just garbage‚•πthe nice things about quick assist are
1.
good connection
2.
draw on person's screen
3.
invoke task manager even if they cant
4.
restart their computer remotely, and then automatically reconnect when the computer restarts
and auto log back in
5.
most important
its preinstalled
idk there are certain windows things
that are just
useful
and not anywhere else‚•πyea
ehh
having been using mac for almost a year or two now
macos has all i ever need or want
like yea quickassist is useful‚•πi mean my list of things on windows
are quickassist‚•πbut i never see myself using it‚•πConnect
aka Miracast
and OneNote‚•πyea i have airplay but thats kinda different‚•πthis is like
so useful‚•πi never draw so‚•πdid i tell you‚•πi take notes in le terminal‚•πhow at Drama club‚•πyea‚•πlol terminal frog‚•πterminal is nice‚•πbut like the connect thing
its like Sidecar‚•πits convienient to make .md files in it‚•πbut it works on all the things
windows‚•πi want to try this so badly
but i dont have an ipad‚•πso i can use my laptop as a second screen
and interact‚•πhuh
see this is what i wanted to do
get an ipad pro and a mac mini‚•πyou dont understand how useful this was at drama club
like
it like
saved me‚•πhuh‚•πlike
you do not understand
how much easier it is‚•πnot like‚•πto be onstage
with the light board
rather than off stage
with the light board
like
cuz what we had to do before‚•πnot like‚•πwas have one person on stage
and the other
at the board
and then
we would yell
to each other
or use walkie talkies
but then‚•πah of course‚•πone person would inevitably be better than the other
with the system
which was usually me
and so like
not like
but so what i could do
was pair my laptop to the light board one
and then‚•πgood job‚•πtake it to the stage
and get
the screen
and the controls
on stage
from my laptop
it was
amazing‚•πhuh‚•πmr Harvey was like
blown away
and then it solved all our problems
i could go and debug
on stage‚•πthats convienent ig
i would never see myself using it
i think apple has something similar to it
lemme check‚•πalso universal standards are nice
like USB C‚•πyup‚•πapple uses USB C
which is good‚•πusb c is a godsend‚•πas you can see in that picture
im using mr Harvey's charger‚•πif the macs used a fricken lightning
i would have killed something
i wish i could
the downside is i need like a massive brick
that can supply like 87 watts‚•πHarvey's laptop does 120w
over usb c
cuz dell magik‚•πdell es bueno‚•πthe limit is 100‚•πi like their laptops‚•πi dont think his XPS 15 does charging at 5w‚•πidk what mine does‚•π5w charging is a nice feature
my Lenovo has it
well more like 5v charging‚•πhuh‚•πcuz it means
in a pinch
if you forget your charger
you can use any USB port
or like in a car‚•πhuh
i mean i wish i had usb ports
but‚•πno
like
any usb port you find
that supplies power
if you have a type a to type c cable‚•πhuh
wait
then
if ur comp has a usb a that supplied power
and u connect it back to ur computer with usb c
infinite energy?‚•πinfinite power
yes
ik
also if ur in a place where there is no high voltage‚•πi have found out the hardway
to never charge a macbook pro with multiple usb c things
cause it charges on any usb port‚•πwhat happens‚•πso if u plug 2 things that give power in
it just rejects power completely‚•πlol
Lenovo just like
idk what it does‚•πu gotta like do a full reboot for u to make it work‚•πits just cool with it‚•πi think apple released a update that fixed that
and allows u to pick
but i dont wanna update‚•πthe thing about it is for 5v charging you need a boost converter‚•πcause big sur‚•πcuz laptop batteries are usually dual cell
usually in 2s2p configuration
or 2p2s
and so they are 7.4v
and that means they charge at like 8.2v‚•πhuh
like electrons‚•πno
stop
we are done
with electrons‚•π1s22s22p6
oh we r just getting started‚•π2series2parallel‚•πwe havent even done covalent bonding yet
oh and redox reactions
those r fun‚•πdid you wanna go into Biomed‚•πidk im bouncing around stuff
but yea its something i would like to do‚•πi see
you could do stuff in my mom's lab
she took a high schooler last year‚•πlabs r cool‚•πshe does imaging‚•πhuh‚•πshe wants this
as i have discussed
already‚•πyes‚•πits 800k
i think
wait no
that's the cost of the whole project
its more like 350k‚•πthats expensive‚•πit is
but ppl giv money
*yawn
i should do
more hw
i have been doing hw since like
12:05
- dinner
and this discussion‚•πU should
We got edison bulbs today‚•πi have another math section to do‚•πI am both so fascinated and terrified of them‚•πwhy
wait
real ones?
or LEDs‚•πIdk
I think they real‚•πare they dark orange
or light yellow‚•πLight yellow‚•πLED
wait
i think
wait
are the filaments thin
or thick‚•πIdk
I havent looked into the bulb itself‚•πdo the filaments look yellow when they are off‚•πKinda‚•πyeah LED‚•πThey r more orange
They look so cool tho
Cause they dont have a diffusion layer
Its just clear‚•πwait
i sent an image
this?‚•πNot exactly
Kinda‚•πwe got some like that
well‚•πDifferent shape and stuff‚•πsome with clear
for the chandelier‚•πMine r clear‚•πcuz we have a center hall colonial‚•πThey look so cool‚•πyes
cuz you see that chandelier was drawing
so much current
it arced every time it was turned on
like to the point that‚•πUm‚•πthe switch
had black dust
coming out of it‚•πUm
Thats not good‚•πand the switch got warm‚•πUm‚•πso we switched to LEDs
which required 1
buying leds
and 2‚•πBueno‚•πbuying a ladder
since the thing is so damn high up‚•πI understand
We have a thing on our staircase
Its so high up there‚•πyes
heres a question
why are white LEDs
hardest to make
and why were they the last kind of LED to be made‚•πIdk
I feel they would be the easiest‚•πno
that is
not
you see
the reason
is that #1
white
is not a color
its all the colors‚•πAh this‚•πbut then theres the chemistry of the LED
different chemistries make different colors
thing is
our eye only sees up to blue
as well as red and green
red came first
it was ez
no prob
now
theres this trick
called fluorescence
where you shine light on something
and a different wavelength comes out
but‚•πWavelength huh‚•πunfortunately
it only goes down in energy
so
if you have red
you cannot make blue
or green
so only red
but then
they came up with green LEDs
so now you can make yellow
although i think they came up with chemically yellow LEDs too
but blue
blue is not easy
no it is not
it was like
*checking Wikipedia*‚•πNice one‚•πit was not
until
the 1990s
that the first blue led
was invented
each color
has to be invented
also
forgot to mention
before red LEDs
came IR LEDs
but so this Japanese guy
came up with a Gallium Nitride formula
for blue leds
but it was like
really dim
and expensive
it took
a long time
for it to become brighter and cheaper
but
with blue LEDs
you could now
make white
fun fact
white leds
do not use red green and blue
they use only blue‚•πCymk?‚•π+ a phosphor coating‚•πHuh‚•πit means
that
wait
*getting image*
this is RGB
but
this is Blue + phosphor
which is much more like incandescent light‚•πHuh
Interesante‚•πnow the samsung 2835 is a thing
and so now
white leds
are commoditized
good white LEDs
i have 1200 samsung 2835 white LEDs lighting my bedroom‚•πAh right
U should set up the rgb‚•πi should
um
no more words
the thing is like
i need another PSU
to run them
i really like my 2835s
they are really bright
and color accurate
but unfortunately
they emit vinyl chloride vapor
so my mom says i have to take them down
so i dont get cancer
*sigh‚•πOf course‚•πidk its probably not that bad
its only when they are on
and they heat up‚•πIts prob a little
Otherwise they wouldnt be allowed to sell them‚•πits china
so like
its the coating‚•πBut overtime it could do some damage‚•πthe tube they are in
i leave them at 30% perceived most of the time
which is 10%
aka i think about 4.4 watts
my watch is just at like 9%
idk why
its usually at like 65% at this time
i need to do 20 more math problems
and you have switched to Capitals
which means
you are probably going to sleep‚•πYup‚•πPsychoanalytic Lens‚•πCorrecto‚•πcy pays attention
*sigh

lets get started.
lol this question assumes i know anything about baseball
it assumes i know what the "pitcher" is
To move up to AP or not
for Gov/Econ‚•πi prob am
as well as ap econ‚•πwait
r they different classes
or is it gov and econ
one class‚•πit is gov an econ
one class
there is a seperate class
called ap econ‚•πah
i might do AP Psych‚•πidk i kinda want to get financial literacy credits out of the way‚•πsummer‚•πand ap econ convers those‚•πjust do financial lit over the summer‚•πi might
idk what to do for electives‚•πare you doing AP Physics‚•πyup‚•πwell then its easier to choose electives
since you only have to choose one‚•πyea one elective
i need to check if i got all my elective credits out of the way‚•πi need arts and financial lit‚•πi got arts this year
and we did cad last year so thats 21st
or whatever that category is called‚•πi should have not done IED and CAD
i should have done animation that year‚•πyup
i just did animation
it was ez‚•π*yawn‚•πthe USA
it is not worth it
emphasis and theme
how can this be done
in what‚•πthe usa is not worth it‚•πnice‚•πor something better than our iPad 4 from 2012
so its either a weapon‚•πor‚•πI think it works on my hardware
I wonder why that is
but with LoRaWAN
The red one would be smaller
i will never need to type that character
its sorta meh
well actually if you paste it in chrome
that is interesting
but uwp is made with .net framework
but yknow it could also not work
yes
tbh i should go
right click on file in onedrive
on which ima connect raspberry pis
I hast indeed
o wait
And the router status leds
where cy spent 3 days a week for 2 years
no thats 3
there are just slightly too many
and maybe take a different approach
and some of the new surface devices are actually slightly repairable for the first time
i just dont use it as primary
what is that‚•πs/‚•πit would‚•πs/‚•πIt's a life vest‚•πs/
s/‚•πbut she was like
I see
Um
i dont think cet is a word
there were some others i did not work as closely with

upi
my power supply smells weird
I forgot mine
so i removed it
ima doin LoRaWAN
and its being a pain‚•π/‚•πShould I do lvm
In china
my power supply smells weird‚•πthe hell‚•πi taught my brother how to use espeak
That is good
that is anticompetitive
i couldn't get them on fedora or ubuntu either
of my dad's money
that is also dissapearing tonight
Yes I am now aware of that
i see‚•πupi‚•πum cy‚•πlol‚•πso it will never work
wdym
otherwise it is ce
and lights
be vegetarian
but what if i am in west asia
but a whole computer

all your devices have 5g

AMD RX 5700 seems similar

there are some other things though

you must look beneath the surface
that
and I have rebooted the pi
frankly the only reason why i have taken a slight liking to iphones
What about it

run sts on a human
because the human's output will be very clear
such that it can be run through stt
on a computer
yes‚•πhmm
i just wrote a program‚•πno imma do this
you know how there are live translating humans
they translate what they hear
into another language
that they speak
in real time
so what i would do
since the stt can understand my voice so well
is i listen to my grandfather
then
"translate"
from English to english
and have the stt listen to me‚•πtranslate from english to french and try it

i had to on monday
it was bad‚•πalso like
my laptop
is having
GPU failure
it got much worse tho like‚•πhaha‚•πit would black out every time i let go of it‚•πthats bad‚•πidk why
it was doing this earlier with Google Slides
like a month ago
google slides just started like
disappearing
kind of like that
but it would turn white instead of black
also on this laptop
so like
I'm not sure
i am running the windows dev channel

Go to it‚•πi clicked one once
it said‚•πOr ddos it‚•πWarning.
You are about to see naked people
and i was like‚•πThats not good‚•πid rather not
its not much
but
it paves the way
for what's to come
*sigh
the problem with 0 bytes is like
if i change one character in my code
i cannot save it anymore
since that would be one byte more than i have
so i cant even code anymore
i even have NTFS filesystem level compression enabled on my downloads folder
which saves some space
14gb
i could enable it on the whole disk
lol that's why theres no space
theres an update
time to go to 4h fair planning meeting
maybe i will get to make them a
i like making‚•πHuh
U bottom out of storage really quickly
I make it a habit to have 80+ gb left‚•πlol they are making us rename ourselves to our favorite fair food‚•π100+ if it drops below 70‚•πmine is bubble tea‚•πNice‚•πthey are figuring out how to rename themselves‚•πHow‚•πtbh i wonder that too‚•πIm still so astounded‚•πits like
my pc works just fine
like
everything works
zoom works‚•πWait‚•πbut
if i try and save literally
one byte‚•πSo if one cookie gets loaded‚•πof code
it says no
error
no save
no space
no the cookie wont get loaded
or itll get loaded temporarily into RAM
or
it will delete some cache
and put it there‚•πhuh
that‚•πtbh idrk how it works‚•πis very old icons‚•πlol‚•πthis is what happens when u use unnotarized mac apps‚•πi need to listen to meeting
bye‚•πadios‚•πsee im in a zoom meeting
they really dont use that much bandwidth
amazon bad
i mean like
even Microsoft has a larger renewable energy portfolio than that
and they are like really small
compared to amazon
this is part of the reason i support google cloud over amazon aws
uh wat
ok it wenaway when i reloaded it i was werried‚•πthis is a thing in canada
when I went for a college tour there they had to read a similar statement‚•πlol‚•πyou

CodeTools‚•πMy dad's excimer laser blew up
and now theres fluorine gas all over his lab
he only has one excimer laser left‚•πwhat is an excimer laser‚•πOh no
Not the most electronegative element‚•πsome extremely powerful UV laser
that costs like 50k‚•πThats cheap
Tesla vs laser‚•πlol
except now they cant do the experiment their client needs
he got an email that said
The laser failed (in a big way)
i am making improvements to CodeTools
^^this works now
its not much‚•πAPI‚•πbut it represents‚•πI am working on
MultiHangman‚•πit represents that
the backend
has changed‚•πCy sees‚•πnow i will implement things
you know what my favorite thing about JavaScript is
the print() function
literally‚•πI am going to use elm‚•πprints the document
on paper‚•πno more javascript‚•πgo in any browser
any page
f12
console‚•πI really hope mcconnell asks a question‚•πkay codetools works now with the new system
which makes absolutely
no difference
to the user experience yet‚•πfrontend
vs backend
understandable

then maybe work on this some more
the flipgrid says its due today
the problem is in order to do that for my "selfie" i have to put my mouse on the ground to click the capture button with my foot

and im lost
high level: only allow certain html tags
low level: < followed by not < or > and followed by not [list of allowed tags] followed by >‚•πramesh casually testing the new emotescli and deletes his namespace‚•πlol
cy trying to understand the difference between var and let‚•πconstant vs not constant
no like immutable
vs mutable
in rust it's let or let mut‚•πum
what is mutability
i still dont get it‚•πwhether you can change it or not‚•πbut
then
what is const‚•πlike
a default value
a setting maybe
something that DOES not change
like an immutable
might be different
for different runtimes
like user input could be immutable
a const wouldnt be‚•πhm‚•πhmm
why hm with one m‚•πcuz im lazy‚•πare you sure
you haven't seen others do it‚•πso var is function scoped
and let is block scoped
and const is immutable‚•πidk
maybe
i hate js
bye‚•πbye
hey ramesh‚•πWhat
Is it‚•πwould you like to see
some changes
that i made‚•πIn a few minutes‚•πok‚•πok

is hard‚•πramesh
i can do
whatever i need to‚•πi know‚•πwhen i need to‚•πit's just that

je suis en train de faire quelque chose‚•πYea its just i see alot more sketch mega stuff then others
Cant‚•πI really want to make this programming language
what do you think
i sent three snippets‚•πIts good‚•πIdk I have thought about making programming languages‚•πimma write mine in rust
it'll be interpreted‚•πYou have to really know what you are doing‚•πyeah
tokens‚•πIdk you should try
I might work on CodeTools today‚•πgood‚•πNice‚•πAnd get multiple tests set up‚•πI think im watching a movie about a mom killing her daughter‚•πHuh‚•πimma

Ba?
it cant be‚•πyes
its solid barium‚•πbut like‚•πthat means its barium

lemme just learn apache cordova
then I can port directly from an existing web app
i oughta learn some of these js frontend frameworks tho
like react
i know about ionic because the 4h app person used it
to make the 4h app
i was not 100% satisfied by the result
see since its a web framework
you can like
run your app in a browser

its almost working
but then like
not working
cy does not like js arrays
they dont =
python:
JavaScript:
can you tell that one makes sense
and the other doesn't?
i repaired my code
smh
javascript
dammit javascript
tf is this
it exists
dont tell me
it doesn't
exist
hi my name is javascript
and your array
an array.
lol its my fault as usual
btw ramesh

hi everyone
who is doing the 4 days in person
i may be switching to virtual

I dont think u can change rn tho
Mp 3 started‚•πno by tomorrow
you have to decide
virtual or 4 days in person‚•πIve already submitted virtual‚•πk
ramesh you will be happy to hear‚•πOooh
See
Now that it's 4 days
I probably will never go to school
if it were two I would have probably went mp4‚•πlol‚•πthis is annoying
I really wanted to go to school‚•πi almost have fun stuff working with codetools‚•πalso
codetools isn't working
as in
monaco won't load
at all
.‚•πyes its in active development
the code is
corrupted
rn‚•πuse git
i use git
so i can go delete everything
and not have issues‚•πplease wait as i locate where my promise ends‚•πmy internet is having issues
either that
or no
the internet is having real issues‚•πsmh javascript
brackets‚•πuse elm‚•πi dont like
brackets
they get really messy
and then eventually
you end up with one missing or one too many
and it all goes down from there‚•πthis is regrettable‚•πlol
so many errors i forgot what i was even making
please wait while i remember
k it does nice stuff
go to the editor‚•πam
the
new test doesnt work‚•πwhat
pitcher
please
um
it works for me
how do you reproduce this issue‚•πlog in as Username
Password
then try going to the editor in any browser
including chrome‚•πk dont edit anything
or it will probably break
since it does not support multiple clients on one file‚•πI didn't‚•πwait ik why its not working‚•πmonaco is broken‚•πits because
your content is outdated
i must erase your content
wait
hold on
i cant do that yet
wait
please wait while cy edits his code
and makes it actually generate the right stuff
k reload and try again‚•πit runs
but does nothing‚•πpitcher
please‚•πoh
it works‚•πok‚•πMake it like
more obvious‚•πmake what
more obvious
i mean
i can put an arrow
like this?‚•πyes‚•πthat is being added rn

and added a script to turn off your lights
f‚•πgee thanks vscode
for putting a fcking space
before every
single‚•πah‚•πquotation mark‚•πcy swears now‚•πhe does
when hes mad
your code just like
errors out
and you wonder why
and then it turns out
and you use that like 20 times
and every other string
now ends with a space
a;sdflka;sdlkfja;sldkfj‚•πand I
I use emacs‚•πi thought i had fixed it
but now it wont save args
it is being nice now‚•πyes‚•πyou have not implemented the structure i requested‚•πwhat did you want
again‚•πso it cannot detect which ones have runtime errors
lemme look‚•πjust send me the protobuf
for what you want
and ill do it eventually‚•πum
you mean a .proto file‚•πyes‚•πlemme see if i can make one
why are you using required btw
its bad practice
and not a thing in protobuf 3‚•πim using
protobuf 2
dont make it protobuf 3
it doesnt work with kotlin‚•πyes but they explicitly state
do not use
required
even tho its a thing‚•πokay
get rid of it then‚•πno you can do that
imma just make a protobuf for what i want
this is what i sent you last time:‚•πis that
protobuf‚•πno its not‚•πgive me protobuf‚•πi will try to do that
hi ramesh‚•πthis
is what you want‚•πyes‚•πthen you will have it‚•πok‚•πnot today‚•πok‚•πnot tomorrow

it does type conversion‚•πOh then thats fine‚•π== allows type conversion‚•πI thought it was comparing integer with a string‚•π=== "strict ==" means no type conversion‚•πHuh‚•πi just still cant get over the fact that like‚•πInteresante‚•πpython^^

ig
whats this
in the powershell terminal?‚•πyou need to install ipfs
lol‚•πhow tf do i do that on powershell‚•πim being like ramesh
if i send it on telegram would that work
or should i send a link‚•πa link would be better
i can curl the link and get it‚•πhere download it from ipfs's official gateway:

you need to install brave

which livestream is the one that shows everything‚•πall of them
they r the same livestream‚•πone is 360‚•πr all the same
which one?
idk they all will probably do all the stuff
i wanna see the jetpack
its cool‚•πim installing eyes

no‚•πtbh idk what that even is‚•πipfs
so tor is basically what ipfs is
but the http version‚•πim just going through a directory i have called "PortfolioSite5"
uh
no
that is not‚•πwhat is tor‚•πno
tor is
similar
but
not
that
at a
ll‚•πwhat is it‚•πtor is like a vpn
a distributed vpn‚•πah
I see
that seems very cool‚•πlike
in school
you can use tor
to access
blocked websites‚•πhum
do you‚•πyes‚•πdoes it work
wait‚•πalso sometimes its faster downloads‚•πokay well then I will use it‚•πlike if for some reason its really slow in the US‚•πso with tor you can access regular websites‚•πmost of the tor relays are in europe‚•πnot just
the onion ones‚•πyes‚•πif it just
like
is faster
why doesn't everyone use it‚•πno its way slower
but
in certain edge cases
a mirror in europe
will be faster over tor
by like
10%
simply because the tor relay‚•πi see‚•πhas a faster transatlantic connection‚•πI may investigate this
also
tor is full of FUD‚•πwhat is FUD‚•πthey try to FUD you against tor‚•πlol
tor is nice
their main thing tho
is that
they are 100% anonymous
like
if you use tor
literally no one
can identify you‚•πwell
there are other benefits too‚•πwell no they can identify you
but
they cant see where your requests are going‚•πmm
is this why you have brave‚•πso that's why people use it for dark web
so no one knows they are going to sell drugs
?‚•πbrave
has tor built in‚•πum
i didn't know that‚•πit does
you can go try it
go to the facebook onion site‚•πdoesnt brave also have like discord builtin?‚•πidk
but personally
i might try vivaldi‚•πwait i like brave now
it has both IPFS and Tor built in‚•πi should go ask my dad about tor
so he can yell at me‚•πlol
the main problem with tor is like
a lot of sites block it‚•πah‚•πwhich is annoying‚•πwhat if you try to access like‚•πno they have to explicitly block it‚•πhow
does one do this‚•πidk‚•πim curious‚•πits not that easy
but you can identify certain characteristics
like certain ips
idk‚•πis this‚•πsee i dont normally get this‚•πmicrosoft edge‚•πno its brave
with tor‚•πoh
it literally
looks like edge‚•πcuz you can use tor for bot spam
cuz ur ip changes
every time‚•πyes‚•πyou reload‚•πddos
interesting‚•πslllllllowww‚•πwhat about speedtest
misclick‚•πlol gaming over tor‚•πHa
do you play games cy
hCaptcha‚•πtor triggered cloudflare‚•πugh
oo cloudflare has that?‚•πits ddos protection
byewtifil fonts

latex is awful
verbose trash
also it's really hard to change the font‚•πits not awfu‚•πfine
i might try to learn it‚•πi mean u should

im not sure what i think of it‚•πEs a bueno song‚•πah‚•πyes‚•πim now listening to akil sawng‚•πur not doing ad hoc tho right?‚•πwhat is ad hoc‚•πlike terminal
where u make every flags‚•πit is like

keycloak is beckoning‚•πwhere can i find
hi res

Can u use OAuth2 to sign into other services?‚•πyes‚•πLike aws as an example
If u can
Imma try making one work‚•πimma try
but mine uses nix to automate stuff‚•πthere we go‚•πHmm‚•πsmloadr‚•πAs long as i can like link OAuth to like gsuite or something and use that for all my accounts‚•πwhats the deal with oauth‚•πIts an authentication thingy‚•πyes i know
but like
apparently this is a thing‚•πYes
Google
Does something very similar to this idea‚•πbut i dont get it
do you host it?‚•πYes‚•πfor your services
i see‚•πTake google
U sign into auth
It adds token‚•πyes‚•πThen all the services redirect to that for login‚•πor i could do telegram style
no passwords‚•πno
insecure‚•πwhy‚•πbecause it is
like
what if someone gets the phone‚•πtrue‚•πyou should enforce 2fa‚•πno
i will not‚•π2fa is good‚•πenforce
2fa
i dont like 2fa
its really annoying
not unless its really nice 2fa
TOTP is awful‚•πbut this isnt what i want
lol‚•π?

On the second floor‚•πwait‚•πand annoying‚•πwhat if
if you have a wife and a child
if you could only
spend the rest of your life with one
which would you choose‚•πum
a wife‚•πwhy
i think there is an answer
which is I can have more children‚•πcuz it would be depressing to not ever see the child grow up‚•πuhm
the child grows‚•πthen they are not a child anymore‚•πUhm‚•πthey are your child
you contributed to their birth genetically‚•πidk‚•πSee hold on a second
This is only for you
So technically the wife can be with the child right?‚•πum
no
no loopholes btw‚•πAww‚•πDankPods liked the Galaxy Buds Pro
which is um
interesting‚•πSpend the rest of my life right‚•πyeah‚•πSepukku for the win‚•πwould you pull an antigone?
you get reborn
revived
can't do that
you can only die of natural causes
or like‚•πHey hey hey‚•πold age stuff‚•πPoison is a natural cause‚•πno‚•πWait so u say revived right‚•πstop trying to mess with the constraints‚•πIf i commit sepukku‚•πu dont die
or how about if you commit sepukku
your family goes with you‚•πDamn this turned dark quickly‚•πso akhil
choose
wife or son/daughter‚•πSo this
A lifetime‚•πyes‚•πIs defined by the period of usefulness
So
If i become obsolete at one point
I have ended a lifetime
So
If i end my lifetime but am not physically dead
I can create a new lifetime
Avoiding this entire dilemma

im kinda mad i didn't learn react or angular or something
and now im suffering from the consequences‚•πhaha
id only use elm
js is like‚•πidk i want to reuse components
and now i have to resort to
copy paste
i mean i could use Jinja
but like
idk
ideally i want to "build"
my webpages
like make the components
and then have it compile them all together‚•πimo
i like vue‚•πidk that's a next-time thing‚•πget a mac
it makes this easier‚•πin what way‚•πnix tools
clean ui
great ecosystem and really good support for webdevs

i first have to clear the webhook on my telegram bot‚•πmake downstairs a thing‚•πno
downstairs is my actual servers

this feels like 1950s movie soundtrack tbh
lol guess what
i like 50s music

not all the songs
some of them are most certainly not 50s soundtrack
actually i think it was just that one
i will stop talking about this album
and work on codetools‚•πramesh is still
doing things‚•πi am dying rn‚•πwhy‚•πwindowz‚•πlol‚•πand hw‚•πwindows "just works" for me‚•πno its not that
i need a 900$ license‚•πtf‚•πyes
windows server
is horrendous‚•πwhy the f‚•πalso the drivers dont work‚•πare you using‚•πwindows server 2019 datacenter/standard‚•πwindows server‚•πcause‚•π"learning purposes"‚•πits a server‚•πprobably‚•πi mean
i can get 3 years on evaluation‚•πthen get a job
and pay for it‚•πuse‚•πso i probably will do that, then reinstall in 3 years‚•π3 years
or pirate it‚•πLinux‚•πdoesn't have gpu-p‚•πill do this‚•πwhat is gpu-p‚•πwell hold on‚•πbut like‚•πi can do gpu p
rn‚•πhe doesn't have to‚•πlike it work‚•πbut you dont need windows server for it
gpu-p basically lets you have
one gpu multiple vms with the same gpu
without spending 90000 dollars on a sr-iov gpu‚•πyes
i need windows server
to run AD and KWS‚•πcy: what is sr-iov‚•πand mabye DNS
And WDS/iPXE
tbf
u can get like a nvidia tesla card
for 60$ on ebay
like a k10 i think‚•πbut those are bad
but like
so is the 710
apparently you can gpu-p linux as well
but linux to linux
using lxc
not real vms‚•πeh
its not the worst ngl
it gets the job done
idk ill prob install rancher os rn
this'
is docker madness‚•πyeah
that's how ovirt works‚•πwelp lets see if this works‚•πthis one is

as I said before
idk why
i like it‚•πbyewdiful div
loooooooooooooooooooooooooong‚•πis this even english?‚•πah
im stupid
my protobuf wasn't working
now it does‚•πnice‚•πshould I upgrade to 10gb ethernet?‚•πYes
or get 100 fiber‚•πim not that rich‚•πit would go well with your ryzen 9 5950x

right
i do have four now
the old two were replaced with two new
will be*‚•πim working on codetools
im redoing the editor for like
the 3rd time
i may just make it a single page
that changes its layout based on the content
idk
then i would have to write js in excess of what i would like to
excessjs
watch out this is about to become a jamstack app‚•πjrunner5 updates are basically almost done
success is standard here‚•πoooo fancy‚•πJSON.stringify is the standard around here‚•πso securityexception wont always work
it throws a securityexception first time
and then it does weird stuff the next
hi cy
i am going to make a point
one sec
protobuf
json
this is a 15 argument test‚•πum
you know you can like‚•πjson is
huge‚•πfirstly
its what like
1.5 kb
not even over a network‚•πfor a lot of traffic‚•πand secondly‚•πit's going to get bad‚•πyou can make jsons more efficient‚•π‚Ä¶‚•πby using shorter names‚•π‚Ä¶
how
no
protobuf doesn't even use names
also
readability matters when doing thigns‚•πprotobuf is not readable‚•πhuh‚•πjson is readable
protobuf requires all this extra stuff‚•πthe protobuf
creates an object
which imo
is easier to use than json's dict indexing‚•πimma go work on CodeTools
*continue
working‚•πim done with the protobuf update‚•πon codetools‚•πill test it a little bit more‚•πok‚•πalso cy
can you send me your emoji method
i can debug why it is throwing a server error‚•πum
its not
wdym
hi my name is cy
and i tried to use JS spread syntax
and guess what
the
entirety
of
Google Chrome
came
to
a flaming
end.
welp
now i know how to instantly crash ppls browsers
wait
its working now
why is js so bad
im like how do i copy an object‚•πemoji
long emoji
Welcome
try typescript maybe‚•πmeh
rn
i need to figure out
why
monaco‚•πemoji‚•πis not doing‚•πcan you send me the emoji method‚•πlanguage features‚•πplease‚•πwhy‚•πi want to
figure out
how big it is
and then figure out why it throws a server error‚•πits the size
what happens is
its too big‚•πyes
i want to see
that for myself‚•πso the protobuf doesn't get fully transferred
and so‚•πyes‚•πthe library throws an error‚•πje veux voir‚•πflask returns the 503 error page‚•πici‚•πand then‚•πnon‚•πjs cannot parse it as JSON
and so it says
bad.‚•πi just want it
here
for me to see
thank
um‚•πwait ramesh
did you add timeouts
to jrunner5‚•πno
do you want
a timeout feature
I can add one‚•πyes‚•πif you tell me how long‚•πotherwise like‚•πyeah yeah‚•πum
timeout of like
15 seconds‚•πk
uh
how do I crash it
ik‚•πum
idk‚•πwhat do you want
you can like
handle this exception
basically
you can also change the timeout
by changing a constant in the module‚•πyes‚•πalso this thing gets really mad if you get a compiler error
on the solution method
no‚•πum
ok‚•πit just does undefined behaviour
imma fix that‚•πk‚•πthis is basically gonna become
*cygh
why
the
heck is there even a resultType
cy
this is not a great design‚•πmethodResultType
solutionResultType‚•πno i mean
compilerError
shouldn't the solutionResultType have a compiler error in the enum‚•πum
both methodResultType
and solutionResultType
should be of type
RunResultType‚•π*cygh
there is an outputresulttype‚•πyes...‚•πi was saying
we get rid of runresulttype
and only have an outputresulttype‚•πand?
but
then
how do i know
if there was a compile error‚•πwe add
the compile error
to the outputresulttype‚•πbut there are 7 output results
or 0‚•πwdym‚•πor 5
or 10
or 20‚•πno‚•πor 2‚•πit only does 1 output‚•πor 4‚•πif there is a compiler error‚•πbut
what if there are 0 inputs‚•πthat's not valid‚•πyes it is‚•πyou can't just‚•πthey want to check
if it compiles‚•πput an argument in‚•πramesh
you can add‚•πChange it back‚•πa solutionRunType‚•πThat was correct‚•πor whatever
do what i said‚•πcy's duolingo bird is coming to me
i dont
understand what you uhm want
can you like
tell me again‚•πi want to know
if the code
compiles‚•πatm
you can know if either one didn't compile
but you cannot tell whether it was the solution or the input‚•πno i want to know both if they solution and if the input compiled‚•πk so then
what im saying is
why do we need resultType then‚•πthere should be no results if the resultType is CompilerError‚•πwdym no results
so it just
disappears‚•πyes‚•πwhat if I did
Error
instead
or just um
kept is as it is‚•πi want to be able to do this:‚•πand added
the compiler error to the output types as well‚•πresponse.methodResultType
and see if it is success
or error
if it is error
i want a methodCompilerError
that i can read‚•πum
what about
what I have now plus solution output type being compilererror
I will add a compiler error to the solution output type
which basically
enables you to do
what you asked for‚•πum
send me the protobuf
before‚•πk‚•πum
why is CompilerError a thing here
it shouldn't be
also
get‚•πso you know which one failed to compile‚•πrid
of
the required‚•πi will‚•πthey all fail
cuz its a compiler error
if its a runtime error
individuals can fail‚•πtrue‚•πif its a compiler error
the whole thing fails‚•πyes
that is what is in place rn
it only returns one result
even if you input 15
with the compiler error info‚•πshould i write another protobuf for you‚•πno
i just want to understand what is wrong with this‚•πthe compiler error
must be
in the root‚•πwdym root‚•πthe top level‚•πthere is no level
there is one level‚•πno‚•πoh‚•πasldkfjhalsdkjfh‚•πi see what you mean
okay‚•πok‚•πAgain this still has that‚•πsend me the whole
protobuf‚•πum
that's what we have rn
I see issues with it‚•πno its not
such as‚•πwhat if the solution is a compiler error
but the input is not‚•πalso wait actually‚•πsee
there's no point in this
you could just add a compiler error
to the output enum‚•πa;sdlfkaj;sdlfkj‚•πwhy
literally why‚•πwdym why
this is the correct way‚•πi dont see a difference between this‚•πramesh
the difference
is that
the compiler error refers to the code‚•πand this‚•πrather than the inputs‚•πthat's
why
it doesn't matter
you get one
output‚•πno
remove all outputs
if it doesn't compile‚•πthen how do I relay to them
the message‚•πthis‚•πof what didn't copmile
ah
there's no need for it to be in the root
unless like‚•πits just more logical‚•πi mean
i dont really think it is
besides
it's extra code
urs is like more lines than mine
the schema is more complicated‚•πit is larger but less complicated
it makes sense
rather than being weird
if my code doesn't compile i wanna know why
if my code doesn't compile
it shouldn't just
run
one of my tests
and fail
and tell me
that my test failed
it should tell me that my code didn't compile‚•πit does
tell you that your code doesn't compile‚•πwhat if my code has no tests‚•πthat
wont work at all
no matter
what you do‚•πbut that needs to work‚•πwhy
what if you just put in a dummy argument‚•πno you cant do that
how does this joor thing work‚•πi can compile it
it will just be
like why is putting a dummy argument not okay‚•πwhat if the function divides 4 by that number
and that number is 0
then it fails‚•πit wont run the function
if the function doesn't compile‚•πwhy cant you compile
the function‚•πoh btw
if it is empty
it will still return an output
with the empty stuff
or a compiler error if there is a compiler error
does that make sense then‚•πno
if there are no inputs
there should be no outputs‚•πno
I am trying to reuse stuff‚•πramesh
you have to compile the method right?‚•πyes‚•πok
so
if the compile fails
say compiler error
put the error
then return
how hard is it‚•πthat is what
i was going to do
except the compiler error
is in the output‚•πlemme write you some pseudocode‚•πno
the problem is that whatever you want can already be done with this‚•πits not about functionality‚•πit might not be how you want to do it‚•πits about logic‚•πbut it works‚•π*sigh
i like logical solutions
that make sense‚•πI think
it will make sense‚•πso that when you want to change them‚•πwhen you see it‚•πlater
its not
a nightmare‚•πthis code is already bad
also
i have to like
add a whole 'nother layer of logic for just compiling
with no args‚•πyou are telling me
it does not just
compile the code
then run it‚•πit does
but it requires args‚•πand you can just‚•πthe way it works is‚•πomit the run part‚•πit makes more than one
function
and each function
runs the method with arguments
and those methods
are in the class with the inputted method
so if you try compiling with no args
it will not compile
since the method that runs the input method with arguments
requires arguments
otherwise it throws a compiler error‚•πso
its the java
that's doing each iteration‚•πthis won't compile
so basically
to do a compile check
i need to not add these methods
and try compiling and seeing what happens
then return that in an output‚•πwait
why cant it just like
it generates
run tests
for each test‚•πyes‚•πso if there are no tests
it will not generate
the functions‚•πhmm‚•πto run the tests‚•πyes this is possible
I am very illogical‚•πand if there are 5
it will generate 5‚•πin fact
it shouldn't generate tests
if the array is blank
so
the fields should be
optional
not required‚•πlol
um
didn't i tell you like
last time‚•πthat's not
the same thing
as dont use it
fine
kotlin bad
im working on empty arguments rn
this is random
but i can probably call someone rn‚•πum i can call i guess
if you want
if you gimme a minute‚•πi guess we could talk about codetools‚•πok

wait
what happened to codetools
:(‚•πcalum is ddosing my infrastructure‚•πdid calum
destroy it‚•πkind of‚•πbecause
my account
is full of shares‚•πoh yeah lolol
cy gave me login‚•π...‚•πlol
Username/Password‚•πum
haha 69 69 haha‚•πlol
also playtools is dead‚•πplaytools is back up
but only with the help of cloudflare
playtools is too easy to ddos
*dos
i want to make a threaded tcp proxy that does what cloudflare does
and does robo checks
cy has an idea
i will embed rate limiting identifiers in the session cookie
these do not require db access
lol nvm i fixed it with NGiNX
i enabled rate limiting
lo and behold
calums software no longer works.
the problem is this:
what if they are at school
then what‚•πright
hmm‚•πwell‚•πwhat if you just
blocked non browser user agents
so that would be a starting barrier‚•πbecause you can
*cough‚•πchange it
but‚•πddos it
from a browser
that's the easiest way‚•πmeh‚•πjust run that
in the console
and bam.
server dead.
the thing is
i want a really fancy system
that like‚•πyou could just like‚•πdoes robo checks‚•π5 second
requirement
like the
checking your browser thing‚•πramesh‚•πfor every page‚•πthat's not just a 5s delay‚•πi k now
it's cloudflare‚•πthat is a js challenge
it tests to ensure you are a browser‚•πno
theres also this‚•πalso you can just start 400 threads
then in 5s
also those dont always just pass through
they sometimes fail
and then you have to do a captcha
playtools already has a captcha
on the share viewer
it returns a required captcha every 20 requests
each worker will lock
after 20 requests
and then it requires a captcha
to unlock it‚•πidk the school ip is hard
i think
if you tweak your rate limiting rules
it might still work‚•πyes that is what im thinking
the thing is this
its min 0.1 rps per person
to run a player
unless you start playing and pausing
or loading content
or all that
so it ends up being more like maybe 0.5 rps
so that means
at 10 rps limit
20 users
can use it
although
if the client can just
retry
tbh other than the school issue
nginx rate limiting is highly effective‚•πwe are getting somehwere‚•πits really fast
and nice‚•πwtf
wait‚•πthe problem is like
i have to take the site off cloudflare‚•πwhat the f
actual‚•πwhat‚•πthe
function is not in the docs
but
it's there
or like the struct‚•πi set the rate limit to 20 rps
with burst=15

lol ez‚•πhow so‚•πlinuxize?‚•πsong‚•πez such that that is fixed now‚•πramesh can UI design‚•πthat
font
no
nooo‚•πi mean
tbf
this application is like
actually useful
if someone wants to use it‚•πi like making my own everything‚•πI do too‚•πi wanna make a low level multithreaded tcp server‚•πI did that already
for jrunner5
and multihangman (but thats udp)‚•πi essentially want nginx
but mine
such that
i can implement
whatever i want
at the lowest possible level
i may work more on codetools
codetools is also about 0.5 rps max per person average
but it introduces a whole new set of funness‚•πthanks
when I open the file picker
that is good‚•πungraceful wrapping
has been added‚•πwhat is ungrateful wrapping‚•πit does not look for spaces
it just
wraps
oh also ramesh
its like
broken
haha lol its not bork
i just
forgot that
arrays start at
0‚•πyes
in protobuf‚•πlol forgot twice‚•πhaha
i think it's really funny
that we just send random responses to each others' messages
that are like
off topic
and not responses
who are those three people‚•πhi my name is cy
and i definately
can read that‚•πm
that's
a you issue
it works‚•πbetter‚•πwhy is it having a compiler error
when all the outputs are valid‚•πthose tests did not run‚•πnice
monaco at it again‚•πctrl f5
this is the dev server
so fun things happen‚•πyes
QmR3WaYJEqiDAEqvt6JQ9oDKLr6esBtCuNardgJpBhYAem‚•πits takin a hot second‚•πwhy hot
it's some random japanese song
lol‚•πwait actually
its "hot minute"‚•πidk why‚•πnot "hot second"‚•πidk‚•πnot loading‚•πtry
in the ipfs desktop client
no‚•πim listening to other music rn‚•πhaha‚•πcalum spent like 45 mins at 4h
trying to replicate python requests.Session()
in javascript
so he could dos playtools api‚•πthis is
a weird cover art‚•πum
ive seen weirder‚•πi mean
the song is good‚•πtime to test the scalability of my solution
and add another tab
remember
each tab
has a different language
and has to autosave‚•πwhat
about
i18n‚•πwhat is that‚•πinternationalization
translation of your interface‚•πnope
no
sorry
not
doing
that.‚•πwhy wont the ssh library work‚•πidk‚•πthere is literally no password
when I run ssh
there is no password.
then when I try to log in with no password
and I get a‚•πcy is hungry
he did not eat dinner
the frozen pizza was so bad
that cy just
did not eat it
he also did not eat lunch
or snack
that said cy is sitting in a chair
doing nothing
so he doesn't need much to keep going‚•πmaybe
idk why this is broken‚•πcy fixed it
he like
changed things
incorrectly
the codetools dropdown now has Test Challenge
which does some stuff
it was remarkably easy to implement this
thanks to my scalable code
i like this 404 page‚•πdone‚•πramesh is a rust fanboy‚•πI use other languages too
I just want to get good at lower level‚•πlearn how to program microcontrollers
that's the most fun low level stuff
i was doing that at some point
where you actually modify the registers
and deal with buffers
and deal with interrupt tables
and flag bytes
bit masks
peripheral and clock management‚•πeh
I am gonna learn assembly next
I got a book on it today
where you do have to modify registers fyi‚•πidk i just feel like‚•πassembly is low level
you get to play with memory addresses‚•πlow level is less relevant on OSs‚•πjumping around
i want to write an OS‚•πits actually relevant with microcontrollers‚•π*sigh
cy finds a way to point out something is wrong with what I am doing‚•πyou can write a microcontroller os‚•πeg
protobufs
assembly
etc‚•πidk im just suggesting‚•πi have like
zero interest in microcontrollers atm
but that may change because things
aka kitchen lighting
with light strips and esp32s‚•πLoRa‚•πsince we like got a new kitchen
I might use MQTT
if I can figure out what that is‚•πlol
its a pub-sub system‚•πi mean
can you give an example‚•πwdym‚•πlike
where would I use it for example
give a scenario
of what happens with mqtt‚•πsending commands to IoT devices‚•πyes
that is basically what I am doing
what about the sub part‚•πwell the device is subbed
and the user pubbs
but also
the device can send state data‚•πhmm
this seems very useful
you could do health checks‚•πthat is
mqtt‚•πwhat
protocol does it use
like is it tcp or udp‚•πTCP‚•πm
I see
Imma look into it‚•πits remarkably easy
to use‚•πin rust‚•πum
what are you writing in rust
that uses mqtt‚•πa qt
gui‚•πoh
its probably not that hard
I installed Tasmota on my china plug
that way i could control it via MQTT‚•πhmm
how much is a chinese plug
i want a chinese plug
so I can automate lights‚•π$7‚•πlink
imma buy one rn‚•πalthough
if you pay $9 more
you can get one with it all preconfigured‚•πhow do you flash the firmware on this again‚•πcuz installing Tasmota on a china plug is not very easy‚•πdont u have to like
disassemble it‚•πwell there are two ways
one is to dissasemble it
and solder wires to the ESP‚•πk no‚•πand flash it‚•πthats out‚•πthe other way
is to use Tuya-Convert
which is this thing
that runs on raspberry pi
and hijacks the plug's auto OTA update system‚•πi like that
now second question
is chinese plug safe
or is it something bigclivedotcom will disassemble to show how bad it is‚•πmy plug has not melted
idk it seemed fine to me
the construction was high kwality
oh also‚•πhmm
continue‚•πHomeAssistant is a thing‚•πyes‚•πidk i did not use that
i used Mosquitto‚•πimma write my own software
like I always do‚•πno Mosquitto as my MQTT server
then i wrote some software‚•πwait does mqtt have to run on the plug too
i dont get exactly how mqtt works‚•πyou need an mqtt server
and mqtt clients‚•πah
my deployment tool 100% works basically
now
except my xml merge algorithm is having small issues‚•πA recent Chromium update causes graphical glitches
having to do with the backdrop-filter rule
i know this is an issue with chromium
because
it affects chrome and edge
and i have seen it on multiple machines‚•πfirefox
has the same issue‚•πno this is a different thing
the elements just
dissapear
go to playtools
or codetools
and mess with the header bar elements
or the run code button
which rely on GPU rendering
and you will see glitches
for example
the run code button
green lines will appear to the right of it
oh also this recent update just causes browsers to die
when reloading pages
this has now happened twice‚•πhave you tried
firefox‚•πi have‚•πdoes it have these issues‚•πno‚•πthere is a logical solution
don't you like logic
Use Firefox.‚•πfirefox does not look nice‚•πuserChrome.css‚•πthe antialiasing is bad
the scrolling is bad
oh also
v8‚•π*yawn‚•πlike‚•πspidermonkey is fine‚•πfancymouse.js
worked in v8‚•πi bet if you made the same thing in firefox
like‚•πbut not spidermonkey‚•πin firefox
tested it in firefox
then it would work‚•πno i made it work in firefox
by lowering the refresh rate
then it worked
i didn't have to lower it that much
it still looked good‚•πwhatever
this works‚•πcool‚•πthis
makes a vm
and installs nginx
and k3s
doesn't that seem useful
at all
what about my vm
yawn
i dont need this kind of ego boosting
it's fine‚•πyour vm‚•πit exists
imma‚•πyes‚•πmake a test server‚•πk‚•πand start deploying stuff to it‚•πk‚•πbut i gotta add the most important feature yet:
emojis‚•πlol‚•πso you dont see
you see‚•πyes‚•πsomeone got bsd running on a m1
the nice thing about kodi is that it has basically chromecast support
since you can cast youtube videos to it
and whatever else kodi supports‚•πChromecast is nice cuz like
everything supports it‚•πi mean
my parents literally only use chromecast for youtube
so i could probably get them on kodi and they wouldn't notice
minus‚•πthing is like‚•πinstalling the app‚•πmy dad got like
Disney plus
then he was like
i wanna watch it on my tv
then he was like
*sigh
time to install apps
and I was like wait
just chromecast
and the he chromecast
and then he happy
cuz he doesn't have to install apps on the tv
also then I get control‚•πah‚•πfrom my phone
automatically‚•πI think kodi can play disney+‚•πare you sure‚•πI am seeing‚•πmany companies were like‚•πhere‚•πhi my name is unigram
you are typing and |
s s s | |s ss|s orry I died
kodi
i remember i used kodi once
idk‚•πIt got better‚•πandroid tv is really nice
until it dies
and says‚•πI wanted to try android tv on my pi
but the builds are broken‚•π"WiFi is disconnected"
and then like
just doesnt
work
Chromecast is really nice tho
like
much nice‚•πnvm‚•πlol
i mean
the pi's gpu is like
so bad
although that said
kodi somehow managed to be fast
ik if i try and play a 1080p video in Raspbian it just like
does not work
but when i tried it in OSMC
it worked‚•πkodi doesn't use x11‚•πvery well‚•πthat may be why
it like
uses gbm
which is more low level‚•πidk i dont watch much tv‚•πsame‚•πmy brother and my dad watch tv‚•πbut i was thinking
I could replace our bluray player with kodi‚•πwe have an androidtv
and also a FiOS Cable STB
i do watch some tv
i watch the news with my parents
after dinner‚•πmm
I have to do work
bye‚•πNBC Nightly News with Lester Holt

hi im ebay
i hear you want an
iphone
i like microsoft edge
it lets me save my downloads to a custom location
so if i have to download 100gb of google data
but i only have 25 MB of space left on my main drive
i can save
it‚•πdo you use linux‚•πto an external drive by clicking save as
no
i mean
yes
for my servers‚•πbut do you use THAT linux
the linux with that logo‚•πno
‚Äèhi ramesh
no
that did not work
hi ramesh
‚Äè so now i can type like thgis  and see it come out like that‚•πthgis‚•π‚Äè no just copy and paste my message into the send box
‚Äè this is quite fun i have to say
but it only works on some platforms
unicode is weird‚•πoh
rtl‚•πh4emuQVYqRMynNMYc‚•πthis website
looks good‚•πwhats the point of rust
like i dont get it
what is it used for‚•πc dependency management is bad
so I don't use C
thus I use rust‚•πbut what do you make in rust‚•πwhatever you make in C
and C++
rust is more C++ than C though‚•πso like computation stuff‚•πI guess
and desktop applications‚•πi mean
desktop applications
are not really
c
*cough
electron‚•πOk
Electron isnt that bad
All the electron apps run fine for me‚•πelectron is terrible
the worst garbage there is‚•πthe thing is
why use electron
just make a
website‚•πWhat?‚•πelectron is just a website
with its own install of chrome
and so it means each electron app
has its own chrome runtime environment
where it runs a website
tbf vscode is electron
and its not bad
but as you can see
its literally chrome‚•πyes
that is the one
good electron app
Google Git‚•πHmm?‚•πtell me
how that is
not
balanced‚•πTf is ur AgI_3
Its just AgI‚•πwhat
wait
ow wait
silver is that one element
that is 1+
in the transition metals‚•πI think so
Idk i just know silver usually isnt solluable‚•πI remember now‚•πGood job
Idek what charges the transitions r‚•πlemme see if changing it to AgI works‚•πUgh i have a quiz tmrw on this stuff
And i do not remember anything‚•πi hope i dont have a quiz
i mean
this webassign
is due
tuesday‚•πPretty sure everyone has a quiz
So urs is prob most likely on tuesday
Unless pernia is nice
And didnt give un quiz‚•πwho's in my class
do we have a quiz?
lol akash probably muted this channel
does my expression convey my level of surprise‚•πNope‚•πlol i forgot
theres a calendar‚•πU have a quiz?‚•πno‚•πWait
That says calendar
I cannot read‚•πlol‚•πUm
What
Yea no way a tests next week‚•πi do not know when my test is
apparently word 2021 is gonna have a document dark mode
so white documents
become dark grey‚•πHuh
I mean my pdf viewer does that‚•πcuz like
the document is the main source of eye searing brightness‚•πOh those ions on the bottom r nice‚•πi convinced my dad to buy me storage
i said it was "for school"
because zoom said
"you are low on storage, and that might cause interruptions"
and zoom is a school thing
right?‚•πUm
Nice one ig
How
Did u manage this
Im still so astounded‚•πhow much u have‚•πIdk 256 i think?‚•πi have 512‚•πI download random stuff
And i still have like 70gb left‚•πi have 62.6 MB left
i like how when windows runs out of storage i cant like
save my code
but
i can still do like
really complex things
it hits 0
like a literal no joke 0‚•π...‚•πlike you dont understand
0 bytes
like
like i said
i add one character to my code
ctrl s
save error.‚•πDamn
Idk‚•πits going down my the minute‚•πI havent ever had low storage issues
Like once i dropped to 30gb left i think
And i ran my software‚•πmy phone has a similar issue‚•πAnd i got back up to 80
Um
Why dont u back up ur videos
To like somewhere else‚•πthe majority are on the SD card
i could just move them to the SD card
or like get a bigger SD card
i have a storage issue
i just like
fill storage‚•πIdk i think my phones also pretty low‚•πlol but you have 4x less storage than me‚•πBut apple just offloads apps i dont use
I never have any storage issues
Ever‚•πeven my extra space is filling up‚•πWhy dont u
Clean the drives
Like ya know delete stuff u dont need
Or clear some caches and log files‚•πtbh idk what is even taking up my space‚•πMabye rebuild some indexes‚•πlol wtf windows‚•πIt‚Äôs going down‚•πyes‚•πBy the minute‚•πthere was this time
i was in a French supermarket
in france
and i looked at the price
on the price tag
and then
the price just like
went up
before my eyes
and i was like
wait
hold up
wait
that price
just changed‚•πOr u may have thought it was a certain price
I never had that happen to me in a French supermarket in france‚•πlol
no but then like
one second‚•πI am downgrading nixos rn
so I can cachix
so you dont have to wait 2 hours for launchnix to build‚•πYay
What is cachix?
Is that just like a way to use the nixstore for files?‚•πi took a closer look at the price tag
and i was like
that price tag is thic‚•πOoo
Is that eink?‚•πthen i looked at the one next to it
and its battery was dead
and i was like
wait
it has a‚•π^
Looks like eink‚•πyes
it is‚•πThats cool
My French supermarket in france was boring
It did have a mcdonalds across the street from it tho
That was fun‚•πlol
but then like
idk
it was like‚•πWait‚•πthe first time i saw electronic price tags‚•πHow do u charge them?‚•πidk
also they had lots of different types‚•πDoes someone have to like plug it in?‚•πsome big ones
some small ones
some long ones‚•πFancy‚•πalso
there were ones in the freezers
and i could tell
they were not enjoying themselves
in the freezer
they were like really faded
and burned in‚•πOh god
Eink was burned in?
Thats a feat on its own‚•πno eink has memory
and you have to clear it
but it gets increasingly hard to clear the physical memory of the display
the colder it gets
cuz it relies on the movement of suspended particles
in a gel
in a membrane array
in the display
its called electrophoretic display technology
yes
a microencapsulated electrophoretic display
aka e-ink
another brand of tags
in another store
these are RF
as opposed to the Pricer ones
which were IR
Li-Fi
this is the kind of thing the Europeans do
idk why
but this is the kind of thing they do
they update the prices of groceries in real time
so they can make the most profit
and its clearly worth it
cuz why else would they spend money on these tags
i mean do you understand how many items there are in the store that need tags
thousands‚•πOf course
Make it seem cheap
Lure someone
Change the price when they blink‚•πlol‚•πStonks‚•πyes
wait we hit 0‚•πYay
Happy new year‚•πlol
at least it cant create any more crap
that i have to delete
wait
what if i could like
dynamically resize my drive
so it always has 0 bytes left
until i need storage‚•πUm
I dont think u can do that
Thats more like for ram‚•πmaybe i should decrease my swap now that i have 32GB ram‚•π*cough‚•πidk
my new ssd arrives wednesday
its a Samsung
unlike my current store brand one
my laptop had the fastest SSD
it was from like 2017
but it was 2017's best ssd
but it was 256gb
and i was like
larger than 256gb
so i replaced it
along with the battery
and the screen
and the thermal paste
I replaced it with a Sabrent Rocket 3
imma do some kemistry
bye

this question has a typo
#2
what
also i cant view the images i send on telegram
since i dont have any space to download them‚•πNope
MoBr_6‚•πthat's not a thing but ok‚•πThats what the answer was so
Also u havent balanced anything in it either‚•πyeah it worked now‚•πNice‚•πImprovement‚Ñ¢

i will be forced to sleep earlier tmrw
and thus
i will be able to stay up later tuesday
when i need it‚•πthats
An elaborate scheme‚•πit is‚•πJust to stay awake‚•πi have tested it tho
if you have 3 days of planning ability
you go to bed late
the night
2 days before

spotify gives me 6 daily mixes
but
somehow
when i click them
they play
something different

no
i want swing
what is it with my computers and GPU failure
also
did you see codetools actually working
something is just drinking my storage

the whole thing is essentially done
now i just need to make a file manager

hi codetools is semi broken in firefox
the padding-bottom property doesn't work‚•πrewrite jrunner5 in jython‚•πlol didnt i say that was an option at some point‚•π1090p‚•π1080i‚•πNo thats worse right?‚•πyes its worse
its cable tv‚•πYea its not good
1080 is also ehh
4k is where its at‚•πits interlaced‚•π1440p is also nice‚•πp is progressive
i is interlaced‚•πprogressive
yes

i don't say liberal‚•πhaha‚•πsince trump says libral
not liberal
um‚•πOh this looks cool‚•πit
has nixos support‚•πYes‚•πThe 8-Bit Guy wont be making a new video for a little while
hes in texas‚•πTf are those searches
Usps does not deliver sunday
Fedex probably does
Ups sometimes does
Texas it does not snow
It freezes
Yes that was sent bout a couple hundred messages up
It kinda sucks
Its like kinda flooded‚•πno
I sent that to akhil
in my DMs
none of the nvflash things worked
since you don't need to do it like that

what
was that tag
the machine tag for the optiplex
i forgot it‚•πwhy
do you even‚•πi just want to know‚•πremember
what
idk what it is‚•πhaha
do you even have it still‚•πyes
can you solve the challenge‚•πlet me do it‚•πmake all the arrows green‚•πhow do I find
oh
does it show what the right output is‚•πno‚•πthat si a bad
fix it
oh‚•πi may add that to the draft/publish feature of the challenge editor
i changed the description reload‚•πah
you removed it from the js‚•πremoved what‚•πthe solution output‚•πyes‚•πso
how am I supposed to solve it then‚•πread the instructions‚•πyes
make it
a + 10
imagine it saying 10‚•πreload the page maybe‚•πbut you did 1‚•πlol i did‚•πlemme make one
cy
make the description use markdown‚•πthen i need a markdown converter‚•πyes
python has one
i used it in flim
my forum‚•πa client side one
tbh i probably could make it md‚•πno
do a server side one‚•πramesh‚•πit will turn the md into html‚•πexplain to me‚•πthat's what I did‚•πhow a server side one‚•πoh
wait im dumb‚•πlol‚•πwhen calling render_template
use the server side renderer
ok no
just use a client side one‚•πdoes markdown do images‚•πyes
also
does the starter code method name have to have a description‚•πwdym‚•πno
does it have to be
myMethod‚•πyes‚•πk‚•πfor now‚•πk
how do I share‚•πurl bar‚•πreload I made a change‚•πto what‚•πwait
im making another one‚•πyou can only change the description and the solution after sharing‚•πi changed an input‚•πno
that will not update
not until i enable publishing
i can tho
go in the database‚•πhow do I make another one‚•πand delete my editor
you dont
not yet‚•πim making a new acc
1 sec‚•πi mean i can make you one
if you want
a new one
under the same account‚•πcan you
i want‚•πok
hold on‚•πlol
try it
did you get it yet‚•πum
i broke it by making an infinite loop
hold on‚•πdid you try recursion
also imma fix this
so the timeout is 15
or 30
and you get a Timed out on every input‚•πi am trying to do it recursively
but‚•πit is too slow
^‚•πi could just do it with a loop
meh‚•πwell do it then
nice job‚•πlol so neither of us can do a fibonnacci‚•πI did it

‚Ä¶
you copied my code‚•πmine is better‚•πwhat is yours
i did mine very lazily‚•πits the same‚•πmhm
actually
it could be even better‚•πum
i mean
sure
i was gonna have it done in 2 lines
but your tests‚•πthat wont work‚•πyes i know‚•πgee talk about terrible code
it expects you to have stuff in this place

it's just AWFUL‚•πi am trying the fib again

225 MBps‚•πThats fast‚•πwell i mean these drives can do like‚•πThats fast
There we go‚•π3 GBps
it would probably have been faster to do it from the direct slot on the motherboard
but like
imma test something
imma hibernate windows
then replace its boot medium
no that wont work‚•πHi cy
Use
Clonezilla
Works like a charm‚•πso does macrium
you just say
clone this drive
and it says
ok‚•πClonezilla is not commercial‚•πidrc as long as it works‚•πYes
I would use clonezilla
Since it works‚•πim already using macrium‚•πAnd i know it works
But u use macrium
Is fine
Also why get a samsung‚•πidk my dad was like in a hurry and hes like‚•πhaha‚•πsamsung gud
samsung best seller
samsung in cart‚•πI got a sabrent rocket‚•πi did too
i have 2 of those‚•π‚Ä¶
i mean
i have an inordinate amount of ssds
like uncountable how many I have‚•πi have one which is my secondary drive for my pc‚•πI just have spare ssds lying around everywhere‚•πand one which is for my laptop‚•πthey are 2.5 tho
like I have a pny ssd
another kingstone ssd
like
5 of those‚•πkingstone‚•πand then I have a sandisk ssd
and the sabrent
then another one from a laptop‚•πi will have some spares‚•πand some others‚•πi have the old one from my laptop
which is really fast
but its really old
its like 4 or 5 years old‚•πcy see‚•πand i will have the one in my PC
which is the MicroCenter storebrand‚•πah
I also have an intel ssd‚•πstorebrand dish detergent‚•πin my mac mini‚•πstorebrand ssd‚•πinland‚•πInland
yes
i dont need huge speed
but like
this‚•πyes
idk I didn't want to spend money
so I just got a sabrent‚•πyeah same with my previous ones
the new gen 4 ones can do 7GBps
the samsung 980 pro‚•πiperf
no
hdparm
well have fun with it‚•πyes‚•πit will probably boot fast‚•πno my boot time is consumed‚•πi can get to zoom in my vm‚•πby my BIOS‚•πin less than one minute‚•πtaking its sweet time
to POST‚•πyes same
but something random happened‚•πit takes like 10 seconds
to post‚•πand my computer stopped taking 1 minute to post
it would literally sit there for a minute‚•πshould i update the bios‚•πyes
but it will delete all your bios settings‚•πlol like i have any‚•πi do
for XMP
and AMD SVM‚•πshould i get a ryzen 5000‚•πyes‚•πno i should not‚•πthe performance boost
is incredible‚•πi dont need it tho‚•πget a 5600x
so
then you can build another server
with ur current cpu‚•πmy computer is pretty fast‚•πServer‚•πi should do hw‚•πyes
I will too
bye‚•πi have a 6000 word interview‚•πyes
bye‚•πand i have to turn it into an oral history report
*sigh
bye
*cough
*yuck
the amount of dust
in that computer
*asdfnaLSDKJEC
im like
eating it
its in my mouth
however a problem has been solved
old
new‚•πthis‚•πjsdksdf;jfdljkfdsjklsfd
cy is a trator
confirmed
cy its me akash and benjamin chee
its like ied - christan + akash‚•πokay
so
cy
you have to filter an expression
or a string‚•πhi ramesh I know why it didn't work
i think i successfully deleted it‚•π‚Ä¶
did you
back up in github
like
download it
now
before you push it‚•πthen pushed it
but
not in like the file manager‚•πvscode has it
make 100 copies of it‚•πso it only deleted previous versions‚•πokay
good
also now you can specify the timeout time
no not yet‚•πtime to make it public?‚•πyes
ill check it too
after I finish apush
and jrunner
now we know you are a child.
let's stalk you.‚•πlol‚•πhas been updated‚•πhas been updated‚•πprotobufs were updated btw
so you have to look at that
optional‚•πyes‚•πc'est le temps de faire apush
adieu‚•πplease understand i will have 0 time today perhaps
but now that it is public you can make the changes
lol‚•πshould I make a competing codetools frontend‚•πsure‚•πsee tbh idk if I want to lol‚•πlol
didn't think so‚•πmaybe
imma change my mind‚•πno
you will not
write it
in rust‚•πI will‚•πhow is rust supposed to work on frontend‚•πwasm
also‚•πno‚•πI will be contributing‚•πthis will not use
wasm‚•πbecuase i dont feel like reinventing the wheel
also
we should use nixos to deploy this
can I tell you why‚•πwhy‚•πyou can write the deployment
in a git repo
and then
you add one line to the default configuration
and it will deploy
the entire
application for you‚•πok‚•πand then‚•πbut i have to do the whole thing‚•πwhen you update the deployment
it will just pull it
and work‚•πthis‚•πalso imma write it
so
it's fine‚•πso get ready to explain
everything‚•πnix has a very‚•πand have me write it‚•πdeep learning curve
no
it's
painful to learn
also it's not like any programming language you've seen‚•πwell then we will not be using it‚•πno we will
i will be writing it
and I will tell you
how it works
and then you can contribute to it‚•πif i cant write it‚•πit's not that hard
if‚•πi dont wanna have to deal with it‚•πyou actually have documentation
eg. me‚•πi need to be able to run this and work on it when i do not have access to you‚•πyes‚•πand thus‚•πI will teach it to you‚•πi must write
the config
and do the install
and all that
so you may teach me‚•πyes
but also
im thinking jrunner5
will be distributed
ipjrunner5‚•π*sigh‚•πtherefore
we can handle
lots of requests‚•πi mean
if you can manage that
and have it be reliable‚•πyes‚•πand cost effective‚•πI will do that
it will use haproxy somehow‚•πload balancing?‚•πand maybe wireguard
but ill make it easy‚•πonce again
i should know
everything‚•πwhat
for jrunner5?‚•πi need to know how it works‚•πthat is my software
if you wish‚•πif its gonna be in my software‚•πi mean
i dont know how half the things work in my software
but if you really want fine
i just
need to figure out how to render challenges‚•πbut like if i wrote a bunch of code that is vital for your service
and didn't tell you how it worked
and it was not the way you would have done it
and your service has to have 100% uptime‚•πtrue
what if I maintain the jrunner5 part‚•πand if i was graduating 1 year before you‚•πand you maintain the other part
but I will tell you how it works if you want‚•πi gtg to math bye‚•πbye
this
hmm
right
it doesn't work
whatever
idk
ill deal with it later‚•πok‚•πwhy wont this work‚•πwhat wont work‚•πi cant center text
horizontally and vertically
it works on one monitor‚•πLATeX LOL‚•πcss
not latex‚•πoh css
then i can help you
send me your problems‚•πflexbox
solves all problems.‚•πi was doing transform‚•πno NO
stop
send me the code
i will fix it‚•πwait lemme try flexbox‚•πok‚•πif that doesnt work ill send‚•πok‚•πnope‚•πsend alla code
i fix code
using my extensive knowledge of flexboxes‚•πhave fun trying to fix that one‚•πum
how should i test it‚•πit has like a million calsses‚•πare security exceptions‚•πwithout the html‚•πhandled at all‚•πits sent
the font wont work for u, just try it without it‚•πwait
centered vertically?‚•πyes‚•πok hold on‚•πit should be dead center of the page‚•πthis is what i see rn
right?‚•πthats what i get‚•πok‚•πon my mac
on my monitor its somehow kinda centered‚•πlemme fix it hold on‚•πwhat color should timeouts be
red?‚•πyes‚•πk
I need to find a way to set the timeout
and put it into mongo‚•πyes‚•πalso
WHAT IS THIS CSS‚•πhaha‚•πhe‚•πi was just copying stuff‚•πidk
yeah
see‚•πthat i had the priviledge‚•πshould I get the venn diagram‚•πlol‚•πit might be insulting
akhil is the left‚•πyup
100%‚•πalso this doesn't work on mobile
just letting you know‚•πyea ik‚•πmobile is really annoying‚•πill get that working later‚•πvertical centering does not work on mobile
in any way shape or form
unless you are making a PWA
it will always be off center‚•πwell i can horizontally center it‚•πlol‚•πso it should be fine‚•πok
oh also
that solution wont work in firefox
i forgot the firefox magic tags
just add‚•πum what‚•πto your body css‚•πcy
why did you use
main
not master
*yawn‚•πcuz that's what it defaulted to‚•πyeah
i dont like that
i will intentionally keep using master‚•πit said use main
not master‚•πi am a luddite
yeah
since main is inclusive language‚•πleader/follower ‚úî‚•πnow to figure out
how to
mongodb
and CyUI‚•πlol
dont break it
or do anything differently‚•πI am not breaking it
since I like‚•πfrom how i do it‚•πi wont
at some point though
I may force you to switch to mongoid
no
like
the orm‚•πmeh
we will see later‚•πas in
i will do it for you‚•πno
you will not do anything
for me‚•πhard fork‚•πthat i do not understand‚•πdo you not understand‚•πthe timeout should just be a constant‚•πno
i want people to be able to set it
for performance reasons‚•πare you in a class rn‚•πbut it will have a default
no‚•πcan we call‚•πwait
no‚•πwhy‚•πI cannot‚•πwdym‚•πI can't
call you‚•πits like literally school
as if you are in a class‚•πno‚•π*smh‚•πtell me this
why can't teachers
set timeouts
if they want to measure performance‚•πok fine
add it to the challenge object‚•πand we have a default
I will‚•πthe challenge object should have no timeout
unless‚•πif I can find
the‚•πit is explicitly set‚•πplace
to add it to the ui‚•πwell rn the ui has no config box‚•πnvm
i think i found it
also
make your code nicer‚•πlol
its not done‚•πi mean
it's probably better than akhil's‚•πlol
its not done‚•πyeah‚•πwhy cant you call
i wanna see what you are doing
to my app‚•πi can call
in a few minutes‚•πok‚•πdid you really set it to not reload templates‚•π?
um
idk‚•πfine‚•πi would like to see the changes you are making
so if they break
i know how to fix them‚•πim
coming
wait
my
microphone
wait
wait
tell me
what to do now
since I reattached my webcam cy‚•πone moment‚•πum
it works on the solution end
also the configuration must disappear if the user is a user
yes
I figured that out
no
not that‚•πi have to inglish
bye‚•πbye
JFYI
The testchallenge
nvm
imma fix it
merge it‚•πi dont like some of the changes
but i can merge it‚•πsuch as what‚•πcan we call‚•πno
what
is it‚•πi dont like typing‚•πi have to do something soon‚•πand i wanna show‚•πso that's why I cannot call you‚•π*sigh
like
the
idk i already forgot‚•πwell then‚•πill just merge it its dine‚•πwhat like
the
site key thing‚•πwell theres that‚•πthat is a good thing
what else‚•πi would rather that be a template filter‚•πi tried that
but
I can try again if you want
like I get why‚•πmake it such that anywhere i wanna use the site key
i just call site key
and not have to pass it in‚•πyes
ok ill add that
what else‚•πalso there were some other things but i have to run it to ensure they are bad
imma merge it‚•πk
ill make another pr for the template filter‚•πok
ramesh it is dying
it cant find the timeout‚•πwdym‚•πhold on
imma fix it‚•πis this a schema thing
oh
i bet it's‚•πit is
hold on
what‚•πit is that
uhm
you forgot to copy a new
protobuf‚•π?‚•πno
something is old about your jrunner5
yes
you must pull a new jrunner5‚•πyeah the other problem was you messed up the modal
the animation doesn't work anymore‚•πright
but just setting opacity‚•πlemme fix that‚•πdoes not work‚•πyes it does‚•πoh
try it
the two modals
overlap
and when you try clicking on change title
it tries to change the configuration‚•πhold on‚•πidk if template filters are it
also i gtg
bye‚•πbye‚•πmongo bad‚•πAh yes
Not mango
Avacado‚•πthis is hilarious‚•πLaTex
in webassign‚•πLmao
I gotta figure out how to do some stuff with nix
I need to figure out a better secret deployment method‚•πwelcome to honors precalc
it all comes back around‚•πah hell yes
wait

thats crazy‚•πTRIGUNUHMETRIK EYEDENTITEES‚•πyes
they r very cancer‚•πno i like them

PLEASE
i think
imma start
with that
bye‚•πah im dying kinda
ah have fun‚•πwhat is gatsby‚•πreact‚•πah‚•πbut kinda‚•πi should learn react‚•πwell i mean gatsby super fricken ez
u just give it html
its a fancy JSX language or smthing‚•πi see‚•πi need to figure out how to draw fricken boxes in html/css‚•πdiv
border: 2px black;‚•πthey have to be like rectangles
filled‚•πbackground-color: black;‚•πhuh
i was just gonna svg everything‚•πor that
but like
you can put stuff in divs
and they auto resize
if you need that‚•πill prob put svgs in divs‚•πwhy
do you need
blocks‚•πidk‚•πif you need a rectangle
use a div.
do not use an svg.‚•π<div id="rectangle"></div>
ah wait
thats
way easier‚•πwhat‚•πusing divs‚•πstop using ids
use class
not id
id is bad‚•πyea i will‚•πespecially for this‚•πthats example code
that i found on the internet‚•πok
^^literally written by a 7 year old‚•πI cant even read it
Its getting flagged by my content blocker things‚•πlol
its not a virus
its just like
so wrong‚•πTell that to adblock‚•πthat it is dangerous‚•πHaha
Uh what?
Wait
Is this an ad for a really garbage wifi repeater?‚•πnoooo, wait is it
wait was it misleading me‚•πYes it totally is
Its about a wifiblast‚•πi totally was hooked by that thing
it was gonna change my life
why you gotta be like this akhil...‚•πHaha
Oh trust me
It still will
Its a magical device‚•πtbf
it probably works fine as a wifi repeater‚•πYea
But i would not buy it
Id get like a reputable brand
Like tp link or smthing‚•πits $6‚•πUm
Its 6$ + like 5 more bucks
Cause its the wrong outlet‚•πoh‚•πPlus tax
Plus customs
Itll be like 19$
WAIT WHAT
Its 40$ on their website
Sorry
39.95
Thats a bargain
Oooo
Yes
I like to pay 1 cent
Where does it ship from?
Actually shipping would prob be like 2$‚•π$0.01 + free shipping‚•πheck yes
its a box
its also my demise
*coughs
that
and another reason
wdym no its a totally legitimate brand
whos comcast?‚•πlol‚•πall ik it comfast
i did it
im an idiot
whats the fcking difference between positioning relatively and fixed‚•πum
everything
ramesh wants to run his rust code on an Xtensa CPU
and he found a rust compiler that would compile to Xtensa‚•πWhats xtensa?‚•πa cpu architecture
Wait
Espressif released the ESP32-S3
ESP-IDF has its own mesh networking protocol
i think that is what we were using at the hackathon
the ESP-MESH protocol‚•πso firefox
they finally
had a brain
and added this‚•πYou dont understand.
I just
used
windows RDP
over an esp8266
like my 50 cent microcontroller
broadcast a wifi network
acting as an ap
and a router
and i used windows RDP over it
120 MHz tensillica Xtensa
240 kb ram
lol "quarter of a megabyte of ram"
no.
32kb ram
lol "120 MHz"
no.
80 mhz.‚•πi like percents‚•πI see‚•πsuperfast‚•πthat's like Gearbest
it tells you
this product will ship in 3 weeks
then theres a button
"Expedite Shipping"
you click it
and it says
this product will ship in 1 week‚•πum what?
u dont pay extra for expedited?‚•πno you just click that button
and the shipping time just like
changes‚•πquick
what do i put‚•πbill wurtz‚•πwhich one?‚•πLong Long Long Journey

oops
ooh no pe
mr howards computer wont work‚•πLucky‚•πi think that's what he said
so
hes like on his phone and hes glitching out
i realllly wanna set up WebRTC‚•πI realllly wanna get the webpage to work‚•πi know web design
so send me things
and i can help you‚•πI will in a bit
I wanna see how to do relative
Cause fixed is nice‚•πoh relative
relative lets you use fixed‚•πBut some things r kinda off‚•πbut in boxes
so
what you do
is you make a div
make it position relative
and then make more items
put them inside
and make them position absolute
then use top left bottom right‚•πHmm
magic‚•πwhy className?‚•πgatsby needs className
not class‚•πi see‚•πdoes the same thing‚•πi really need to learn one of these frontent frameworks‚•πits nice‚•πlol yellow
no kidding‚•πcause u can do components and stuff‚•πyeah‚•πooo‚•πi should have done codetools in one of those frameworks‚•πmabye
actually
depends on how codetools is
if it runs client side gatsby works wonders
if its server try next.js‚•πits mostly client side‚•πthis then
it has a web ide i think‚•πi wanna use react
cuz i really need to bind things‚•πthey all use react
its that some do things a bit easier
and allow u to use like sudo html‚•πpseudo?‚•πyes but sudo‚•πno
but
idk‚•πi love
the pages feature
any js u put in pages
becomes a page‚•πare you in a class rn?‚•πi mean yes
but its gym‚•πlol‚•πbut shes about to let us leave
so‚•πif you wanna call
after she lets you leave‚•πsure
i need to get an svg to load in gatsby
oo we using cycloud now‚•πyes
um‚•πtf is this‚•πwdym‚•πi dont see u‚•πhold on
reload the page
rejoin the call‚•πmake a call
speak
i cannot hear u‚•πlol‚•πthis is why
we use anything but cycloud‚•πit worked flawlessly with ramesh
also check ur speakers
cuz my mic is working‚•πmy speakers r working‚•πcheck ur speakers
my mic
is working
lol i muted you‚•πyes ik
how come‚•πidk‚•πi can choose a microphone
but not a speaker‚•πjoin the google meet
Dr P:
They inject you with Technicium. It's quite fun!
It's better than having to drink Barium Sulfate...‚•πI have to use an android vm
to add
a spotify song to the apcs playlist
really spotify‚•πlol
why cant you use linux‚•πI can
but I don't want the app
on my computer‚•πlol that's ur problem then‚•πthey disabled the feature
on the website
Remember
I don't use spotify‚•πwhat did you do
Jrunner5 literally like‚•πnothing‚•πcaused my computer to be so slow it couldnt even register key presses‚•πhow did this happen‚•πi dont know
but actually‚•πdid you spam it‚•πi think this has been happening a lot
no
i did nothing
and actually
yesterday
this same thing happened
where my input became laggy‚•πare you sure it's‚•πbut i didn't check the task manager‚•πjrunner5
and‚•πit is‚•πthat should not be happening right?‚•πnot some other java application‚•πbecause
#1
i dont run any other java applications
and
#2
i stopped jrunner5 and now all is well‚•πwell
it might not be closing threads properly‚•πprobably‚•πmaybe‚•πidk run a jrunner5 continuously for a while
like 2 days‚•πah‚•πand see if you see the same thing‚•πwait‚•πand send it some jobs‚•πlet me
send it like
500 jobs‚•πbut like
no jobs were sent to this one
like very few
like
20 maybe‚•πhas this always been happening‚•πwell like i said‚•πa few days ago right‚•πit caused my input to become laggy
like realllly laggy
but actually
yesterday
my input got laggy
not as laggy
but laggy
which it never does‚•πk imma run a bunch of tests‚•πand i started this instance yesterday
so it seems to gradually get worse‚•πthat makes not much sense
unless
the threads are not dying‚•πlets call
and talk‚•πno‚•πwhy‚•πdont feel like it rn
i may in a few minutes‚•πok‚•πnow once this is done
if it does not decrease
then I think I know the problem‚•πoh also it was only using 1MB ram
look at the screenshot‚•πyes
becuase it is compiling atm
now it uses 0 cpu‚•πno in my screenshot‚•πyeah im trying to find out why
it is no longer sending jobs
and this is happening‚•πJython
*sigh
why kotlin‚•πthis is a threading issue
not a kotlin issue
if you don't do threads right in any language this happens‚•πidk its probably easier to do threads right in python‚•πno
so like this‚•πum whats up with the 718 MB ram‚•πidk‚•πin mine like i said‚•πit hasnt run the gc yet perhaps‚•πit was 1MB
i suppose‚•πyou should find out how to consistently reproduce it
to have this state‚•πok
lemme try some things
so i just run it 10 times
each time the cpu usage goes up by 10%
also i think you're right about the gc
cuz mine was at 250MB when i tried it this time
should i run it and wait‚•πit might take a while‚•πi stopped it
should i do it again
and see if the ram goes down
after some time‚•πno im not interested in ram
im interested in cpu‚•πok‚•πmy computer is getting slow
it like
the threads do not close
hmm
wiat
wait
wait
wait
umm
ramesh has idea‚•πGoogle Earth runs on WASM‚•πSo
if you
use a while true
it doesn't close a thread
but if you do a normal thing
without a timeout
it does close a thread
which is interesting‚•πso then
make the timout
timeout
while loops‚•πand destroy the thread‚•πyes‚•πsee‚•πcorrect‚•πI have to do some investigation
so now we have the issue‚•πok‚•πwe shall try to fix it‚•πi just realized
if it was written with Jython
you could like
manage the whole thing from within one application
no TCP
no protobufs
it just calls a function
would have a java running component‚•πum
no
unless flask works on jython‚•πwdym
jython is a python library‚•πno
wait
no
wait
wait
wait
wait
can i call you‚•πyes...
one moment‚•πsame
eye am ready‚•πjoin‚•πnextcloud‚•πyes‚•πfine no
we can do it here‚•πwdym
just like‚•πwait
i gtg
hi
i can text
i cant speak‚•πdo this:
find a java/kotlin mqtt client‚•πk
then‚•πthen
make it do something
like
i forgot exactly i have to check
then use MQTT explorer to see if you can send/recieve‚•πok‚Ä¶‚•πthen the whole thing will be run on mqtt
no more TCP server
so that means
the jrunner client needs no open ports‚•πok
ill look into it‚•πi actually really like this idea
we should call about it later
cuz like all you have to do
is start a jrunner thing
and it will automatically allocate and balance and do everything‚•πexplain to me how mqtt works
just like you want me to explain how nix works‚•πits the simplest thing on planet earth‚•πtell me what pub sub is‚•πlisten to me
ok
so
i recieve "hello"
does this make sense?‚•πyes
what about this
if I publish "hello" to test1
how do I read
hello
does it poll‚•πno
no polling
it holds open a tcp socket‚•πthen
ah
then
how does one
like
what I get from how jrunner5 will work is
someone pushes something to jrunner5‚•πi will explain to you later i have a whole plan
i have to do english‚•πk
by e
it is inherently unsafe to run Thread.stop()
Do not use this if you want your program to work.
thread.stop()‚•πthread.join‚•πthread.jion
if thread.running‚•πdijion‚•πthread.stop‚•πla france
I can call
and tell you my plan
or i can meet with Mayukha
if you do not respond within 20 seconds
i will meet with mayukha
I will meet with Mayukha
bye‚•πSprings are annoying‚•πI have solved the annoying thing
by stopping threads
It works.
the cpu pinning should no longer happen
thread stop is safe for my use case‚•πi can call now
i finished with mayukha‚•πMe? I am busy‚•πwdym
i thought you wanted to know the plan
for the mqtt scheme‚•πNot now‚•πwhen‚•πNot today
Or if today
Via text‚•πok
i might do some things with it
myself
or maybe ill just do the java implementation
actually‚•πK‚•πi might just do that‚•πWdym‚•πto learn this kotlin stuff
so i understand it better‚•πIf you want‚•πok
imma eat snack bye‚•πsatisfying animations
i have to watch that for spanish
i do not want to‚•πactually
it will not be MQTT
WebSockets are better for this purpose
lol i have to watch a French yoga HIIT workout video and follow along with it
and it has to be longer than 20 minutes
so uh...‚•πwhat‚•πcuz it involves knowledge of who is "online"
and data translation
so it works out better to do it all with a websockets server
cuz you get more fine grained control
and so its more efficient‚•πthe problem
is that jrunner5 should not be a websocket server‚•πno
its a websockets client‚•πso how does this work‚•πthere is a management server
that replaces MQTT/Mosquitto
and it does all the code running
so the client connects to this server
and when they wanna run their code
they place a run request to the server
then the server opens a thread
finds their code in the MongoDB
then sends that code to one of the jrunner5 clients‚•πim not sure if this is necessary‚•πthen ends‚•πwhat is a gunicorn "worker"‚•πthen
an instance of your app
so like
its as if
and used Haproxy to load balance them‚•πso then
how will a ws server
improve performance‚•πno its for that distributed thing‚•πno‚•πso the server is in my house‚•πNo‚•πor in yours‚•πNo‚•πor at school‚•πThis is
for
unnecessary
not for
just
i already had an idea on how to do this
that requires no code changes‚•πwhat was this idea‚•πone sec
k‚•πwhatever the solution is it has to be lightweight‚•πit is more or less
but not 100%
it runs a vpn server between all the nodes‚•πno
bad‚•πand then haproxy balances the vpn‚•πno
no‚•πi can use
hole punching
over a vpn‚•πno
that is so‚•πwhy‚•πinefficient‚•πwhy is it inefficient‚•πbecause you dont need all the capability of a VPN
or of HAProxy
you just
need to tell clients
hey heres code to run‚•πyes‚•πand they need to say‚•πhow do you plan on doing this‚•πhey server
here is the output
websockets
no
no
stop‚•πwhy is this bad‚•πno NAT hole punching
because
there is
a trivial solution
called websockets‚•πweb sockets are not trivial‚•πyes they are‚•πalso‚•πthey are like 20 lines of python‚•πwhere is the load balancing
done
with your websocket solution‚•πit is done on the management server
if i could call‚•πno‚•πthis would be explained faster
but ok‚•πno‚•πso‚•πalso
why‚•πwhy what‚•πwrite your own load balancing algorithm
over haproxy
that is a bad idea‚•πno
listen please
ok
so
this is the chain of events
next
A jrunner5 client wherever it is‚•πenjoy your supervisord
anyway continue‚•πconnects to the managementWS
the managementWS adds it to its list of runners
^^ repeat as many times as you want
then next
a client
a user
opens the page
they connect to the managementWS
then
they send a run request, along with a contentID
the managementWS
at this point
starts a thread
contacts mongoDB
gets the code
then
formats it all nice
then
it selects from its set of jrunner clients‚•πOkay
continue‚•πand sends the run request‚•πI have refined my idea‚•πto the jrunner client
then ends the thread
then
when the jrunner client is done
it sends a message to the server
saying
im done, heres the result.‚•πok‚•πthen
because its a custom server
it can read the content type
and if it is a challenge_editor
it can go
and save the match output
in the mongodb
otherwise
simply pass that response back to the user‚•πok
now can I
I have changed my idea‚•πok...‚•πslightly
basically you have one endpoint
and then
which then
wait bad
one sec
yes
so you need
a master client
and the master client will basically send a request to your jrunner5
which is the same thing as you said except I wouldn't use websockets‚•πwait
what is the master client‚•πthe master client is a separate thing‚•πcan you guide me through the whole thing‚•πit is basically a sieve‚•πlike i said for mine‚•πim still thinking
one sec‚•πoh also
with mine
the jrunners are hot swappable
at any time any one can connect or disconnect
and as long as there is at least one‚•πyes I know
okay so
the master node basically has a bunch of open connections to jrunner5 servers
the jrunner5 servers when started will connect to the master node
then the master node basically does load balancing
I would like to offload this to some other library
maybe haproxy can be a master node
but basically then it sends the data into the connection
and out comes the result
then it acts like a jurnner5 server
as we have it now
and just returns the protobuf‚•πso i see
but
what is this "master node"‚•πit does not run jrunner5
it is a lightweight server to literally just load balance‚•πbut
how does it connect to jrunners‚•πthe clients connect to it‚•πno jrunners
how does it connect to jrunner instances‚•πit has an open tcp connection to every one of them‚•πso then you have to change the jrunner code‚•πthe connection is just‚•πIm assuming this is client side load balancing right?‚•πopen
yes‚•πno
but then‚•πah nice‚•πit's server side load balancing‚•πheres another question
hold on
so
can you like i said
guide me through
i wanna analyze
im still a bit skeptical of the advantages‚•πI did‚•πof this solution‚•πwebsockets seem bloated
tcp is more low-level‚•πno‚•πis this a kubernetes model kinda?‚•πwebsockets are essentially tcp‚•πnot really
with what on top‚•πbut they deal with like
the size
and stuff
so like
they allow you to more easily initiate
and‚•πI can probably deal with that too
it seems not hard‚•πwell hold on
so
websockets
are just tcp
but
they dont have that size issue‚•πyeah‚•πalso‚•πso what is the advantage‚•πthey work in web browsers‚•πif I just add that thing‚•πand they have apis
and i think‚•πthe thing is‚•πkotlin‚•πthe server
is doing‚•πhas a built in
websockets api‚•πthe server is sending ws requests
so‚•πno with my solution
does nothing
with code running
that is all dealt with by managementWS‚•πi think
it would be better
if you took my master server and then added the websocket idea to that
well there is
but it shouldn't mongodb‚•πour ideas are very close
heres the difference with mine tho
a run request
does not lock up a thread
because
it just asks for the code to run
then
stops the thread‚•πso it is asynchronous‚•πyes‚•πthat would have to be implemented differently
right‚•πyes
well
but like‚•πim not sure there will be a perf improvement‚•πit would not be an HTTP‚•πwell
maybe‚•πwell the idea is not to be a performance improvement
but to be a reliability and load improvement‚•πk‚•πfor a performance improvement‚•πmaybe‚•πstay with current solution‚•πim just like
is there anything slightly lower level over websockets‚•πwdym‚•πsince idk if websockets send bytes
they send strings‚•πno
they send
whatever‚•πare you sure‚•πyes
although‚•πalso
there are things here
like the client‚•πit depends on what library you use‚•πdirectly gets the protobuf‚•πno
they do not
managementWS
handles that‚•πthen‚•πalso‚•πthere is no performance improvement
over‚•πdid i say there was?‚•πno‚•πno the improvement like i said
is in
load balancing
and reliability‚•πI mean‚•πso if a jrunner fails
there are more‚•πnot
Client ‚Üí  (WS) managementWS ‚Üí (WS) Jrunner5‚•πbut
then
the asynchronous model doesn't work
cuz how should the client know when their run has completed‚•πwhen‚•πwithout holding a thread‚•πwell
managementWS is another thread
just a different process‚•πramesh
the client
ok my code is running now
now what?‚•πthe client sends runcode
wdym‚•πresponse
200 OK‚•πthe same thing
it does rn
i dont think there is a major improvement
in async‚•πbut that blocks a thread‚•πso what
it can still make more threads
it's not limited to four threads‚•πi dont think that's how gunicorn works
in fact‚•πworkers ‚â† threads‚•πit says specifically
slow clients
will lock up your server
in the gunicorn docs
and so it says
use NGINX
to buffer them
so gunicorn does not have to sit there
waiting‚•πhmm‚•πimma test something hold on‚•πwhat if
you use an async worker
in gunicorn‚•πwhat is that‚•πit like
switches between requests
idk if I can explain it
because like
im just reading about it rn‚•πsend link
hmm‚•πso
you could just
the thing is
I really dont want to implement tcp with ssl
which was the reason for the vpn
which means if ssl is a requirement (which it probably is)
then ws has to be used
also kotlin does not have websockets built in‚•πidk i read that somewhere
heres a question tho
if we were to implement a load balanced jrunner solution
where would the nodes be‚•πanywhere‚•πanywhere is not a place‚•πbut it will run in a container
anyone can connect to our server
and provide jrunner5 services
but then‚•πno
that is not‚•πwhat if someone makes a malicious server‚•πsafe‚•πand like
makes it output
illegal content
somehow‚•πyes
so no
it would run on our personal servers‚•πwe could add an authentication layer‚•πyes
there would be an authentication layer‚•πlike you need a private key to log in‚•πyes‚•πyes‚•πyes‚•πso then anyone we trust
can do it‚•πyes‚•πgood
what else‚•πso we would have like
4 nodes
1 running directly on the Vultr
for backup
1 at my house
1 at your house
and 1 somewhere else‚•πakhil maybe
or jp
or something‚•πyeah‚•πalso I might run two
one on a pi‚•πactually on our 4h server‚•πyes
also these containers will be running nixos inside
the jrunner containers
because nixos
is really easy to deploy‚•πcant it just be docker‚•πyes
docker
requires an image‚•πso like‚•πalso no docker
docker runs as root‚•πbut i mean
with this system
you do you
so like‚•πyes‚•πinteresting‚•πi wanna use nixos-container
but we shall see
idk what ill do with that yet‚•πi should learn about nixos‚•πit is good‚•πnow for the not-so-fun part
bot protection
any ideas?‚•πah
haproxy
can do the load balancing instead
idk how‚•πbut
bot protection‚•πit has rate limiting‚•πnginx also has rate limiting
but like
actually
i think
i just set limits for the users‚•πi think‚•πthey can only run 100 times per hour‚•πyou can rate limit
people
who security exception
a lot‚•πbut what about just like
a dos attack
like
they come and just like
run while true
500 times‚•πthat is no longer an issue
but
it is‚•πno they set the timeout to the max‚•πin terms of cpu pinning it is not an issue
15 seconds
is the max
i mean
I think they can override that
but we can fix that‚•πbut‚•πuhm
we could like
on jrunner5's side
reject more than one timeout
no that wont work‚•πi wanna stop bots as early on as possible
like for http requests
i can use nginx
to rate limit based on ip
but i think
rate limiting in the managementWS
is where the rate limiting has to be‚•πi mean‚•πfor this application
the main issue
is that
the DB
is annoying
since it takes time‚•πlimit the number of tests‚•πi can
but
the issue i was having before
was that
each request
good or bad
had to request data
from the database
to verify if it was valid
and that locked it up‚•πwhy
does it request data from the database
to check if it is valid‚•πto check if the user has exceeded their limit‚•πah
i think that is fine
if nginx is limiting them‚•πbut its not
since its a websocket‚•πyou can rate limit web sockets‚•πi mean yes
but like‚•πidk
i have homework
bye‚•πbye‚•πI'm going to think about it more‚•πok‚•πand I'll share tomorrow‚•πme too‚•πExcuse me what?‚•πlol‚•πI really like this article‚•πhow u find the mass of br‚•πSubtract‚•πfrom‚•πNuetrons
Pu-239
239 is the total mass‚•πyuh so 100
but it say it wrong‚•πIt absorbs a neutron
So the left side has 240‚•πooooooooooooooooooooooo‚•πAnd the rightside is 141‚•πyuhhhhhh
much thanks akhil‚•πCause there is the product plus 2 neutrons
No problemo‚•πI got scared for a sec‚•πNginx‚•πooooooooooo‚•πlol no dont go to that in the browser hold on
go to this website:
wss://upstairs-direct.secure1.cy2.me/
as the wss url‚•πOoo
I got pong‚Äôd‚•πsend a message
that is not the default
also are you on the right url
lol no
ur not
waut
its being dead
its not gonna work rn‚•πi sent my solubility rules‚•πI mean
It keeps closing
After text is sent
So‚•πno that's cuz
hold on
reconnect
lol its not working‚•πI mean
Its doing a reverse ping pong‚•πlol‚•πIts sending me a ping
And im sending a pong‚•πthis is mostly irrelevant‚•πWhats it suppose to do?‚•πits like
supposed to relay messages
but its just to test
a websockets template
and my nginx config‚•πhmm
i do not wanna do this‚•πYes i have to do that too
what is it
what do we do‚•πwe gotta say an exercise
then do said exercise
what mussels are being used‚•πI see‚•πa modification‚•πwhats fun‚•πand what we think of it‚•πis i also have to do excercises
for french
so like
i can get 2 birds with one stone‚•πoo
idk its the things with the backpacks
ik what im gonna say for modification
get dumbells‚•πdo you have Howard?
no you dont‚•πstaats‚•πi had her
i was her tech guy‚•πnice one‚•πask her about it‚•πseems she still doesnt know how to use tech ig
cause‚•πshe will praise me‚•πshe
doesnt
put
the damn zoom links
on
the google calendar‚•πshe did for my class‚•πwell she forgot how ig for us‚•πgud song
idk what it is with me
and all these genres‚•πidk either
should i stick with windows server
or go back to linix‚•πlinix‚•πyea ill prob do that‚•πiBuntu‚•πits just a lot nicer ig
i also need to do a hassle
and set up load balanced postgress dbs‚•πi need to set up that thing i was arguing with ramesh about
and implement websockets in Kotlin‚•πi need to set up kubernetes
but i think‚•πi have like
0 use
for kubernetes‚•πi may not have enough ram to do a large setup‚•πatm‚•πi use docker
for services
so kubernetes is great‚•πidk codetools will be on a vultr‚•πyea that works‚•πwith 0.5G ram‚•πthat should work‚•πi need to run 2 things:‚•πi need to make like 15 vms‚•πgunicorn‚•πah thats the manegemer kjkjewrjk thing‚•πyes‚•π^ this‚•πlol‚•πeach needs like 4 gb ram
i have 32‚•πoh actually a 3rd thing
one node‚•πto do what?‚•πof the distributed jrunner‚•πah i see‚•πthere will be 4-5 nodes
1 on the Vultr
1 at rameshs house
1 at my house
1 at your house
1 at JP's house / server‚•πmine?
i mean sure
if u can make it a docker, i can host like 100 of them‚•πyeah it will be a docker i think‚•πthen yea i can scale it to like 50‚•πbut like
you can run lots in one docker‚•πyea‚•πthing is like
1 is fine
5 is better
50 is not particularly neccesary‚•πhaha
now saying that
i think i need to install nixos now
so i try getting this entire thing up
with a hot standby postgress db‚•πKid Quill‚•πah yes‚•πmarks all his songs as Explicit
even if they're not
cuz theres like 1 that's not
and he didn't feel like trying to find it‚•πisnt it like if the musician has an explicit tag all the albums and songs will?‚•πno
its per-song
you have heard this song?‚•πthink so‚•πi see
wait‚•πmy music is luck based‚•πhes already at 621k
that was not the case
before‚•πtime to record gym‚•πlol‚•πBiceps, Brachialis & Radial Brachialis (forearm) for refrence
time to do the easiest one, bicep curls
gfdgdfgdgdfgdfgdffgfdgdgdfgdgdfgfdgfdgdfgdfgdgdf
that was the worst 3 minutes of my life‚•πlol
At its core though, ‚ÄúThe Story of an Hour‚Äù delivers its message through irony.‚•πreally‚•πBut then I can't use a raspberry pi
and its that number of zeros‚•πi thought that at its core, The Story of an hour delivers its message in about an hour or so‚•πlol‚•πanger
Okay
It's just about as far
And we could do figure out what to do with them later.
Is that how you do it
I see‚•πs/‚•πor is it between forms
I see
I mean
I may try this
I dont use discord
*sigh
its not a very "integrated" IDE

you must
i discussed with my dad about this
so i am ready to expand with this.
You are Ramesh Balaji
idk next year maybe i get iphone
i see
ima buy apple mac
one in each room
i am not buying another boring x86 laptop
*cough $200 keyboard
and
no‚•πoh cy‚•πfind cool cheap hardware
Good night
i never used any pronouns with them‚•πdamn‚•πWha‚•πU wanna buy an apple mac and put one in each room‚•πlol‚•πi was gonna have an internship
Look deeper
i want the pixel ui‚•πthats a whole level of fanboy‚•πand akhil is Akhil‚•πreally?‚•πdidn't know that‚•πsame‚•πbut i will say a few other words

in what project
I have many other things to do

they are elistist mac users after all; whatever should I expect‚•πlol‚•πyou look like you are 40 and 8 at the same time‚•πlol
that is now
done
and contrary to akhil's response
it was not that bad
my eyes hurt now
time to listen to a good song‚•πum
do you want one
it's in japanese though‚•πlol this one is too‚•πooh
let me send you mine then‚•πU sent this before right?‚•πyes‚•πWait‚•πamazarashi‚•πi love this album‚•πRamesh uses Spotify?‚•πno‚•π*gasp‚•πI have an account
so I can add

to this
and hackathon playlists‚•πi should add to that
i need to add from all the generes
soundtrack
50s
indie pop
swing
j-funk
bill wurtz
cuz hes a genre‚•πlol
yes
also jpop
jpop is good
kpop is bad
north korean music is good‚•πlol‚•πcpop is probably good
2000s pop is good‚•πwhat is c‚•π2010/2020 music is all junk‚•πChinese?‚•πyes
except coldplay‚•πi like it‚•π80s/90s music is good
video game music is good.‚•πRock is good‚•πno hate it‚•πJazz is good‚•πduran duran
what's that one song‚•πTake five?
Its not bad‚•πanyhow
i like jpop the most‚•πWell the opening sounds decent
Thats how i determine what i listen to‚•πfound some French yoga‚•πthe problem with training videos on youtube is that they are sexualized
so I don't like it‚•πWha..‚•πlol‚•πWhy?‚•πit's
true‚•πinstead of having zoom

lets stop now‚•πim just
providing an observation
la clase de fran√ßais
idk how to say class‚•πclasse‚•πprobably clase but cours‚•πSounds right‚•πclasse
ah
k‚•πi like the word tel
it means such‚•πa-t-il‚•πil y a des personnes vertes.‚•πthere are
green people
what‚•πtel personnes ne sonts pas bleu.‚•πsuch people are not blue
idk if bleu is blue‚•πyes
it is‚•πwhy

is it tel or te‚•πle quotidien‚•πlike pronounced
do you say tel

he doesn't want you to listen to it‚•πi like lollypop
hi akhil
lets chat‚•πIts easier to sc‚•πwait
where did the

wait
i must have scrolled‚•πlol
no i do have no time
u distract me‚•πim eating dinner
so i can chat‚•πquick
distract him‚•πlol‚•πi like this ui
this reminds me of some other time‚•πi dont
please allow me to complete my French yoga‚•πlooks fine
no‚•πgood or fine
is this my shadow if i say file
since thats one letter away from fille‚•πim wait
is that english‚•πfreudian slip
no it's french‚•πi cant understand things
im going insane‚•πo hyh nur‚•πits easy
learn french
nur means fille in chinese
it's not spelled like that tho‚•πoh thats cool‚•πdo you have premium‚•πnope‚•πalso have you considered trying linux
desktop linux‚•πsee i would
but i dont wanna install linux on my mac
cause honestly macos is fine‚•πbut linux is better
idk
i feel like linux is better‚•πlol what else is new‚•πit is in some aspects
should i install arch or nix on my server
i kinda wanna go back to linix
but hyper v has such a nice admin center thing‚•πidk
nix has a STEEP learning curve
see
i think you should learn how linux works first
do you know what systemd is‚•πthose r the service things right‚•πyes
but what is it
like you can define this in two words‚•πsystemctl?
um
background stuff‚•πno
it is
an init system
do you know what an init system is
this is an integral component of a unix system‚•πits PID 1 right?
pretty sure i read about it somewhere‚•πyes
what does it do‚•πits the first thing to actually run‚•πyes
it does things
it starts up backround services
and then
it also mounts disks‚•πand everything like branches off of it‚•πsets up the network
etc
k
what is the fstab file‚•πthat has all ur UUIDs for stuff‚•πno
what does it
do‚•πmounting?
for disks‚•πcorrect
it mounts things at startup‚•πno clue
um
config
like optional stuff, idk i just stuff random stuff in here
uh
um
usr data?
um log files and stuff‚•πyes
what is
oh idk‚•πhaha‚•πi mean‚•πtime to make arch vms
this is gonna be absolute cancer
to set up‚•πWhy
describe
every
no‚•πi gotta do the entire thing‚•πcan you understand‚•πfor 10 vms‚•πthe commands
to install arch‚•πat the basis i think so‚•πgood
also script it
use terraform‚•πterraforms for cloud i think
but ill try that and ansible
they both look really good‚•πchef > ansible
since ruby > python
but idk if you know ruby‚•πnope
yea i found, Terraforms for cloud provisioning, Ansible is for bare metal
but terraform has support for vmware and openstack
is openstack good?
i see it pretty often‚•πit is
impossible to set up
openshift may be good
i gtg
bye‚•πyea but that costs money‚•πhi I'm in the basement talking to myself‚•πgood job‚•πfor AP seminar‚•πCy is becoming mad‚•πWhat a weird way th describe practicing for a presentation
That is like saying hi I am staring at random people who I have no connection to through an anonymous computer screen - zoom classes‚•πi mean
why would u practice for presentations in virtual especially
i will try installing okd later
but since thats like kubernetes
i may switch to nix first then libvirt like fedora vms‚•πcuz its 10% of my entire AP score‚•πWait
For ap seminar do u have to take an ap exam?‚•πyes‚•πHuh‚•πbut its not your whole AP score
like with most classes
your AP score is also based on 2 Performance Tasks
PT1 and PT2
this is the PT1 TMP
Team Multimedia Presentation‚•πHuh
One could call it
My catchphrase‚•πgoogle has a mono space font
called
space mono
mono space
space mono‚•πYes
I use jetbrains mono
It has no real significant differences
It just has cool ligatures‚•πDM Mono is good‚•πWhat defines a monospace  font‚•πfixed width‚•πThat looks nice‚•πit does
its very defined‚•πIBM plex mono is also nice‚•πi suppose
i like DM Mono‚•πYea it looks nice
Scientifica tho
Find it on GitHub
I want u to see it before i say anything‚•πthis?‚•πYup‚•πidk‚•πThis looks cool on picture
But using it‚•πlol‚•πIs god awful
What font?‚•πDM Sans
the not monospace version
of DM‚•πWait DM looks kinda nice‚•πyeah‚•πImma install it
Google fonts?‚•πyes‚•πAlrighty‚•πthe f is fun‚•πHoly cow wait
That looks really clean
Yes
Check out cornerstone
Its not really a useable font‚•πwdym
oh‚•πIts more for like websites and stuff‚•πyeah‚•πI still like jetbrains mono
Does DM mono have fancy ligatures?‚•πwdym
what are ligatures‚•πI dont u r using any
Go to jetbrains monos website‚•πwhat are ligatures‚•πThats the best way to show them
Its essentially turning stuff like ~~> into cleaner lines
== into a == without a space
==> into an actual arrow‚•πah
i see‚•πYea they nice to have‚•πno DM doesn't have those
i like that idea
i might use Jetbrains Mono‚•πIts a pretty commonly used font i think
Looks really similar to vscode default‚•πvscode default is different on different platforms
the ligatures dont work
im switching back to DM
for now‚•πThink u gotta enable em somehow‚•πok so the animation when you click the search button
is one to copy
that is a nice

so they are really thin‚•πhow tho?‚•πi mean its because its really sunny‚•πi like clean my entire desk every week and stuff‚•πyou can see it really clearly‚•πtrue‚•πnormally it looks perfectly clean
also the display is matte
so in the sun
it like
looks more dusty‚•πporple‚•πpoiple
Dr. P: "Charging down the page..."‚•πI‚Äôm doing the exact same thing lmao‚•πSomeone give me a COVID vaccine discord notifier
or imma make one
thats my next project‚•πhi i am DONE with PT1
this is
wonderful
PT1 needed to end
and it finally did
wait
mq02 is dead
and my humidifier doesn't work anymore‚•πmqtt
died‚•πi havent been renewing my letsencrypt‚•πshould I buy a chinese plug
smh
that happens automagically right
it does for me
with caddy‚•πits supposed to
but like
i broke it‚•πtheres no certbot
it just has my cloudflare key
and when https stops working
it renews‚•πlol
certbot webroot is nice
it does not take down your server‚•πhow about
caddy‚•πand does not require
giving your cloudflare key‚•πi think caddy does not take down your server‚•πidk
ramesh do you wanna call
and discuss distributed jrunner5‚•πyes
in a few minutes‚•πok‚•πalso‚•πim listening to a song
and it needs to finish‚•πwhat is this
why is it faster
over
wifi‚•πlol
wait yeah
wtf
lol
use wifi then‚•πno‚•πim stuck on wifi‚•πum
idk
nvm
im so confused
oh
i made the wrong server and client‚•πdo you wanna call‚•πfew minutes
maybe 2 to 3
then I can‚•πok‚•πk
send call link
I have to eat lunch
so I shall be leaving now‚•πum‚•πramesh finally gives a reason‚•πwhen do you come back‚•πcomp cy club‚•πyou eat at your desk tho‚•πi
not always‚•πok
hi my name is chrome
im really fast
and
i do this to your memory
woba woba woba woba
9 GB in less than 5 seconds‚•πi figured it out
i can barely type
this is a you problem‚•πum
then we will have to meet
to discuss it
because i have no clue
what the issue is‚•πnvm
want to call now
or‚•πok‚•πidk
if I feel like it rn‚•πim figuring out the issue‚•πbecause if I do it now then it will be too much
k lmk when ur done‚•πi almost have it working‚•πgood
i kinda wanna rewrite emotes in rails‚•πok‚•πbecause I hate flask‚•πlol
ok i got it working
wanna call?‚•πill call at 2:30‚•πthat's komp sci tho‚•πyes
we can call then
but I think we can do it without calling‚•πyou know that nothing happens during comp sci
and that we have to use Discord‚•πi think things do happen during comp sci
and discord is fine‚•πdiscord is awful‚•πif you want to make things happen
it works fine for me
idk why‚•πno the quality
its 720p
and the latency
is like im using Iridium as my ISP‚•πiridium
what is that‚•πA global satellite internet provider
that is NOT Starlink
and is exceptionally slow
but
has a global network
that is fully deployed
and accessible everywhere
except north korea‚•πcan I access it‚•πyes‚•πhow‚•πyou need a reciever
and you need to pay‚•πhow much is it
is it monthly pay‚•πa lot
in fact
it may only be for commercial use‚•πhow much is starlink‚•π$100
per month
i think‚•πthat's too much‚•πwell no data cap‚•πstill bad‚•πand 150 mbps
so
why cant you call
so we can discuss
you can text
but you cannot call‚•πyes
my parents like talking to me every few minutes
what is the
path
im using /‚•πit does not matter
also
i did not change anything on the python side
you have to like
add the Sec-WebSocket-Extensions header
and
enable deflation compression
because the server wants that
i could tell the server to not want that
but
call
please‚•πno‚•πidc if ur parents are talking
you can pause
talk to them
then resume‚•πno‚•π*sigh‚•πi just
dont feel like doing that rn‚•πok‚•πYou can do it at 2:30
or via text‚•πok
imma try some other things bye‚•πwhy is there a taylor swift song that decides to randomly stop outputting audio for a specific period of time‚•πlol‚•πah
it crashes
mpv
this is a strange song
ah
maybe smloadr broke‚•πlol i cant just "forget about async generators"‚•πprogramming my server‚•πi need to know how async generators work
bye‚•πyou should learn nix
bye‚•πthat is not an async generator
but
no i will now create an async generator
no one tells me what i cant do.‚•πoh
i think ik why this happens‚•πi was born
and then my future was cancelled‚•πthis seems easy‚•πi see
im sure you would rather have had it in a protobuf tho‚•πno
i wouldnt
k we can implement this
next‚•πi almost got the async generator working‚•πthis website is outdated so
access denied‚•πi dont understand how generators end
why yes, it did
and who the f are you to say it cant?‚•πme when i try to stop a thread in java‚•πwait
its because
StopIteration
used to end the for loop
but now
it just raises StopIteration
so
i must use a try/except‚•πgot it
so you gotta set the referer‚•πit is beyond me
why they changed this
but ok
so that's why
my websockets code
a try/except loop
to signal when a client disconnects‚•πbut how to get the store numbers‚•πi now know how AsyncIO works
mostly‚•πI now know how the cvs api works‚•πlol
just use Bing‚•πlol
LOL this is so easy‚•πI did it
i got bind9 to work‚•πhi ramesh
come to the room‚•πno
we are doing club management‚•πwait there is komp cy‚•πlol "i can meet at 2:30"
"stuff gets done during comp sci"
lol you were just stuck on this screen‚•πakhil where are you‚•πwhat room should i go to‚•π2
ill come‚•πramesh
i think
it is impossible
for me to get client ips
wait
hold up
no
it works
it does
work
hi ramesh
i saw some random websockets requests to my server
from amazon
hey look another one just came in‚•πJeff bezos wants part of CodeTools‚•πlol
\‚•πmy life for the next 2 hrs
jsdhgsdgsdhgsdklj;sdghjsdg‚•πlol
where is ramesh
he is like
sending me
reqests‚•πam I
I do not think I am‚•πthen who is
idk‚•πget the IP‚•πI'm eating dinner ttyl
?
or this‚•π?
This is not balanced‚•πlol ur right
4O2 on the left‚•π?
SO_2 is a polyatomic
Its one entity
One thing‚•πum‚•πThis looks more correct‚•πoh wait
no
so
that
was for‚•πBut idk the equations and stuff so‚•πthis‚•πAh i see‚•πlol i was like why isnt my worker working
and then i realized
is a thing
gee, thanks‚•πwhat was the questionm?
um
i think ur mass is off‚•πum
ok‚•πit should be 102‚•πno its not‚•πalso u do a weird order for them
our teacher said to do ^101_37Rb if that is the correct one
top number first‚•πum‚•πit def should be 102‚•πwhy‚•π239 + 1 ‚Äî> 136 + 2 + 102‚•πoh right
theres that one extra‚•πyup‚•πi did that order here tho‚•πidk urs is weird‚•πum
right I need to set up a wiki
that will happen
nohost is functining‚•π*sigh
word is bork
i cant read my chem notes
i should not have switched to the preview channel
actually on second thought
dark mode is really good
idk
tf is this
i dont get it‚•πcy, cy, cy
smh
stop swearing.
then ull get it‚•πi did not swear until like
akhil came
and gave me the right answer
and it was still wrong‚•πSmh cy blaming it on others‚•πsmh ramesh smh at cy
you tell me what the answer is
i need to use the RSA sign/verify api
i will now figure this out‚•πim still debiating if I should rewrite emotes in rails
it'll be more maintainable‚•π*sigh
mr y emails me
because a student cannot access his video
at this link‚•πwelcome to tech supoprt!
oh
nvm‚•πand its like
Mr Y...
the software specifically says‚•πMIT?‚•πidk
its some license
its like
wdym‚•πapparently i have limited connectivity
but i dont‚•πapparently rsa is more complicated than i thought‚•πtry pgp
but idk how to sign things in pgp‚•πall i need
is to sign
and verify signature
well i need a signed key
hold on
lemme keep
experimenting
ok so this is what i have to do
i have to take the id of the content
then
use my private key to make a signature
then store that in the db
so then
when the client wants to run
it fetches the signature
and then passes both the contentID and the signature to managementWS
then managementWS uses the public key to verify the signature
given the contentID
this way
with no reads to the DB
i can verify the authenticity of the request‚•πthis is fast‚•πit is
much faster than querying a DB
now of course the only issue is
it will
destroy everything
and they will have to regenerate everything
so ill put it in a folder
and then you run it in that folder
then take the file and put it in the root
or alternatively
i could just add
a check
to see
if the file is already there
wait im dumb
i can just sign them in real time
*sigh
you can now
go to
open the console
go to the test editor
and then
see in the console
in the object
there is now an "id_sig"
that took
longer
than it should have‚•πI see
im like
dealing with servers rn‚•πok
get jrunner done at some point tho
i have to implement the frontend‚•πsure
it is like
almost done
i have to add two things
so ill do it after I finish setting up the edge kettl‚•πwhat is the edge kettl‚•πbeta test website‚•πok
someone tell me why my workers are not working
ok so my worker is working ok
but then
my other worker
is not working
its being lazy
*sigh
asyncio‚•πalso web sockets with bytes
dont have a terminate
which is Stupid.
ugh
i have to learn about kotlin coroutines‚•πsee most websocket implementations use strings
and JSONs
i see
i have to learn about
asyncio
which is being a pain in the tukkus
he obviously knows how to use asyncio‚•πasync
is
coroutines‚•πyes‚•πso ig we both get to suffer‚•πnow you see
my issue is this
i have a "coroutine" or whatever
and it has
and the problem
is that like
the coroutine only responds once every like
18 seconds‚•πalso
I haven't started learning about them
this is unrelated
so I will like
not understand what you are saying‚•πim listening to MAX remix The Greatest Showman‚•πI'm listening to Bakemono by amazarashi‚•πits not a bad remix
but he is certainly not a soundtrack artist‚•πim mad that the tutorial is using macos‚•πoh please‚•πcan people stop using this junk os‚•πno
they will
continue
to use it‚•πok im not having this argument‚•πuntil someone else shapes up
and makes a relevant competitor‚•πthat is known as linux
and windows‚•πno‚•π^‚•πk bye‚•πbye‚•πgo learn how coroutines work
i mean i know how they work
but like
i need to figure out why
one coroutine is like
locking up my other coroutine
right
the server is in development
so um
one moment
^^ run this
its some crap
but it works‚•πuhm
i want
to not do this
wait
ok so this is a websocket server
ok‚•πyes‚•πdoes it not say have any output
whatever‚•πit has output
when things happen‚•πwhen y ou first start it‚•πno not when it starts
it runs on port 5000
when you connect things happen
it will broadcast incoming messages to all clients
except the one that sent the message‚•πnow how do I make it do things‚•πoh and apparently
it prints like
the headers
wdym‚•πlike
code
sending‚•πif you wanna send messages to your kotlin
open another client
and send the messages from there
and if you wanna recieve them
go to that client
and see them‚•πk we will deal with this later
im adding ws vs wss support‚•πthat's not the actual server i have
just to be clear
that is just some crap that works
and is pretty straightforward to understand
so you can modify it
for testing things‚•πuhm
is it normal for chromium to make my gpu go like
beserk
and like have insane graphical glitches everywhere‚•πum
idk if you heard i mentioned it earlier
but theres like
some issue‚•πyeah
i just had it‚•πwith the latest chromium release
i have attributed my issue to the time.sleep() command
the thing is
im not dumb
i did not run time.sleep()
in a coroutine
i ran it in a thread in a thread pool
No blocking code in my thread pool = asyncio queue worker actually works
this is absurd
as usual
polling
works
i can poll the queue
and there is no issue
but who wants to poll a queue
i guess its worth it to poll it every 1 second
instead of waiting 18 seconds for it to decide to work
wait
im dumb
*2
and it has a built-in method for awaiting execution in a thread pool
without blocking the asyncio event loop thread
*smh
time to rewrite everything
alright ok fine
it like
works
but
if i request once
it "blocks" the coroutine for the client
so if it requests again
it hangs
until the last request completes
that's it im going to bed
my brain is not present enough atm to deal with asyncio‚•πI am
Done with jrunner5
But like i havent tested it yet
hi cy
jrunner5 now works with websockets
you just have to implement it on your end‚•πyes
hi im google chrome
i use
eleven gigabytes
of memory‚•πUm what‚•πHey, chrome, my name is windows explorer
i do this
to your cpu
whenever i feel like it‚•π*cough‚•π56GB ram+swap‚•π*cough‚•πhow much do you have running
i apparently have like
130 chrome tabs‚•πa lot of tabs
around that much
on each window‚•πi see‚•πim surprised im only using a gig swap
nice‚•πmine is relatively clean atm
I shut down my computer every night
so this never happens‚•πmine became messy and will prob be for the next week or so‚•πi shut down my computer only when it forces me‚•πi just
close my laptop‚•πsomeone please help this computer‚•πum what‚•πlast time it was jrunner5
this time
its windows explorer‚•πyay *cygh
damn‚•πit is a protobuf-loving company
oh
i thought it was crhome‚•πkrome
krome like memory
what Microsoft understood
was that
ppl
dont use desktops
with 32gb ram‚•πI do‚•πand they made edge
lighter
and less ram intensive‚•πwtf
is using 18gb of ram‚•πlol‚•πah i decided leaving the windows vm on was a good idea‚•πhi my name is
USB 3.2 Gen 1
i bet you know how fast i am
lol jk you have no clue‚•πyou know
jrunner5 is interesting‚•πi do
4gbps‚•πthe code looks better now‚•πi see‚•πbecause‚•πi have asyncio issues‚•πkotlin has when statements
I had none when testing
but I wasn't trying to do much‚•πno cuz this
right
so
i have an asyncio loop
which is running the websockets
but
i wanna send
to the websockets
from a thread pool‚•πah that
you send to the websocket
as a separate thing
like a different url‚•πno the thing is‚•πto make it do stuff‚•πi cant call ws.send()
from the thread pool‚•πu dont
u call it from another function‚•πwdym‚•πlike
thread pool calls a function which is in a class with the web socket clients
and then that function calls ws.send‚•πno the thread pool has access to ws
and ws.send
but
it does nothing‚•πwdym it does nothing‚•πcuz it needs to be awaited‚•πah
then uhm
await it‚•πyou cant do that
in a regular function‚•πblock then‚•πthe thing is this
i tried like
several
different ways
to call ws.send()
from the thread pool‚•πthis file works
run until complete‚•πdoes it
send‚•πyes‚•πa websocket‚•πyes‚•πmessage
from a thread pool‚•πnot a threadpool
but i mean
it shouldn't make a difference should it‚•πlol
except
it does‚•πyou could ask in the python discord
lol‚•πi looked up this online
and they said this
they said
in order to do this
you must
create an asyncio worker
that reads from a queue
and then
push to the queue
from the thread pool
which works
except
it takes
18 seconds
like
it will respond
every 18 seconds‚•πdont use a thread pool then
just use async for everything‚•πbut i cant use that‚•πwhich will be slower right‚•πfor db calls
they dont support asyncio‚•πyou can call blocking stuff
in async methods‚•πyes
but then
you block the coroutine
well
no
so if you run a blocking command directly
you block the entire loop
and your websocket server dies
if you use the built-in thread pool execution system
you can await a blocking call
by sending it into a thread pool
and then awaiting a result
but
then you block the coroutine
that said
i think
this is a limitation
of the websocket library im using
all ws calls
must be done
from within the asyncio event loop‚•πthis is like‚•πor they wont work
but then
what about my queue worker‚•πyou have to offload the database stuff to the thread pool while
stuff is happening‚•πwell no so what i can do is like
this:
but that blocks the coroutine
cuz theres await
but i think
that will have to do‚•πim not too sure how async works
but I will learn
i have to learn it for rust as well‚•πno i can tell you‚•πno‚•πtheres a loop‚•πi dont want you to‚•πtheres a good diagram
lemme find it‚•πI
don't
want
it‚•πlol here it is anyway
the thing is
the client should not be having to send another request
while one is pending
and so
i think this works
to block their coroutine
for 0.05 seconds
while a db call is executed
i just would have preferred something else
but as long as it can handle a few hundred people
i am satisfied‚•πso apple tv isn't just on apple OSes?
I'm shocked‚•π?‚•πapple tv
has
not apple os
apps‚•πYea the app
Apple tv is its own thing‚•πI need to cycle my IP address since CVS sucks‚•πIp?‚•πpublic ip
screw CVS‚•πAh wait im stupid
I was gonna say‚•πtheir idiotic thing banned me
since curl‚•πJust cycle MAC address
But thats for like complementary wifi
Really?
Just a curl got u banned‚•πYes‚•πThats very stupid‚•πyes
i didnt even spam them
i literally just‚•πBtw this is a good trick for like airport wifi
Curl‚•πcurl
yes
once
and they ban me‚•πCurl doesnt even do anything
Welp‚•πhi you can spam from a browser
what‚•πyes
yes
but
apparently cvs is dumb
so they don't do that‚•πwhat is this tho
with the Apple oss‚•πApple tv is garbage to be fair‚•πno i dont get
what it is saying
what is that a list of‚•πIts a list of supported platforms
For the app‚•πfor what app‚•πApple tv
Its an app and a like physical box if u didnt know
Technically apple tries to link all ur accounts to it
Which is so cancer‚•πbut i dont get
what is significant
about
that chart‚•πapple is walled garden
they would never‚•πoh
the fact that
it is available
on other platforms‚•πOn other stuff
Yea‚•πi see‚•πBut apple music is also‚•πyes
i have apple music for android
and i have to eat dinner
bye‚•πAdios
Also btw this is cool
I like this‚•πremember my

I dont think I‚Äôve even seen it‚•πI remember
It‚•πmy story might be
no
thats a spoiler
i deleted things
these are really misogynistic
but ok‚•πlook at the responses
it like
said something
cohesive‚•πyes‚•πit apologized
so‚•πhow
how the heck‚•πit is leaving
because of what it mentioned‚•πthese or not women; opinion is masculine
Okay I will leave now bc of what I mentioned‚•π*mentioned above‚•πfbi open up time
in my story
make that your webcam
image‚•πwdym webcam image‚•πno your pfp

all spikey
i dont know where the digital copy of it is
i have it in a frame on a shelf‚•πno ur making it this‚•πlol‚•πmug shot
yes
that is better‚•πlol
its not terrible
like appearance wise
not expression wise
my hair is not all messed up
thing is like
for my personal account
it cant be identifiable
and for my school account
it cant be like
so bad
that like
cuz like
professional interactions
...‚•πi think this is fine
make that your pfp
for school‚•πlol‚•πdo it‚•πi like my circle‚•πor do it in telegram‚•πright
i have a telegram pfp

hi cy
wanna read my story‚•πno I am currently watching "A Raisin in the Sun"
it has 2 hours left‚•πhave fun
bye
Hey cy read my unrealistic story that copies yours slightly‚•πlol replit now has BASIC‚•π10 GOTO 10‚•πyes
im going to learn react
after I do some homework‚•πwhat did I say
I knew it‚•πi think react is the best option
because‚•πvue‚•π1. websites‚•πelm
yew
yawn‚•π2. react native‚•πbye‚•π3. ionic‚•πnah
flutter does that‚•πim not using flutter
it does not meet
my standards
id earlier use cordova
or just not make apps
cuz apple is dum
and i dont have $100
to spend
each year
for the privilege
of being rejected
by apple
ill do that when i have to
i tried flutter
react native
and Xamarin forms
and
react native
was actually like
native
flutter was some failed attempt to reproduce
the appearance of nativeness
and Xamarin forms
was all flickery
and the animations were made by microsoft
Microsoft does not know how animations work
they are supposed to improve the feel of the ui
not destroy it‚•πI like flutter
ergo I will use it‚•πergo?
therefore
i see
ok
we will be making the 4h app
most likely in react‚•πI hate js
With a passion‚•πlol me too
not as much with a passion‚•πso i wont use it‚•πand we must support
standards
so that vendor lockin
gets
locked out‚•πsays this
while I write js‚•πwhat is this apps script‚•πmy spanish teacher gave us like 37 words
and we have to make slides for them
so I just
made a script to make the slides so I can just focus on populating them‚•πi see
just make a
website‚•πcant
she wants slides‚•πalso what prevents you from like
ctrl c‚•πi have to copy the words‚•πctrl v *37‚•πwhich takes a while‚•πah‚•πlike into the titles‚•πok
have fun‚•πso it's worth the time it took to make the script‚•πi have to make my tile
for my tessellation
lol‚•π‚Ä¶
bye‚•πthen i have to read the AP sem stimulus materials
then i have to learn react
what if i rewrite codetools in react‚•πhey cy
did you read my story‚•πno
not yet‚•πit is
wheres ur soap story
i want to make sure it's not too copycat‚•πi can read it
at some point‚•πyeah‚•πwhen i have time

u also have two‚•πim making my tessellation scalable
literally and figuratively
it wont
center

that looks like the center‚•πlol
um
not to me
wait ik why
i have to make the width a multiple of 4
we are getting somewhere‚•πthat hurts
my eyes‚•πlol
you know what hurts more
watching it violently flicker
for 3 minutes‚•πuse intellij
that solves that problem‚•πim done now
it goes though its whole routine
and the "animation"
actually involves scaling the tiles
since my code is scalable
this is no problem
pun both intended and not intended
lol
my tessellation broke the repl
meh it worked for run #1 so
its fine
hi my name is cy
wtf is this
someone please
help me‚•πis this
not english‚•πthis is AP Semminarre‚•πin that case
I have 0 clues‚•πits like
some plan
for a scored discussion
that we are doing tomorrow
well
starting tomorrow‚•πemail Y‚•πMister Why
imma spend some more time trying to decipher it‚•πthat is laggy
now they're chanting "we love you" like a bunch of morons‚•πlets not get too political
lol did i actually just ask that of us
i am reading my AP Semminarre Stimulis Matireals
is working on the tessellation project‚•πYup‚•πmy animation scales the tiles‚•πLol‚•πthey get bigger and smaller
cuz i have to flex
the scalability
of my code‚•πI'm doing the animation rn‚•πthats cool lookin‚•πreact
is interesting
it wants me to install a JSX preprocessor
and use node.js
for everything
see im the do it yourself type
so with react
i can just design my own fancy ui components
that dont discriminate against android
and be able to reuse them‚•πhey cy
upvote‚•πand then package them with cordova
idk my login
also that's not true‚•πit's humor‚•πi suppose
but like
also
who is u/icanaffordthewire‚•πme‚•πi see‚•πim  a mod
on r/ridge_high‚•πlol
i need to learn more about react
bye‚•πbye‚•πi like the instructions on the Gatsby website on how to install node
the install for mac is like
1.5 pages long
the install for linux is like
3 pages long
and the install for windows‚•πUm what?
Its one line
Brew install gatsby-cli
Yea thats if ur stupid
If ur using gatsby/react u prob have all that stuff downloaded‚•πi do‚•πYea i also did
Node is one of those things u need‚•πi think imma start doing some stuff with gatsby
cuz like
it doesn't require me to use node.js as my server‚•πHave fun‚•πalthough i should probably learn that too
you tried it
what did you think‚•πIts nice‚•πi see
ok
hi akhil
you know how Gatsby works
why isnt my styling working
hi i figured it out
gatsby-browser.js was not in the right directory
oops
oh
my
god
collapsing margins
why
why
why
why
no
stop it
stop
no
a;sdlkfj;aslkdfj
sometimes i really like the W3C
sometimes
they need to gtfo
and stop breaking things
who on earth
thought it would be a good idea
for the margins of children
to result
in their parents being moved down
and their margins
exceeding the borders of the parent
and messing up all the styling
like if they at least gave a way to disable it
which they dont
lol
404 - could not find the 404 page
someone tell me why
random cmd windows keep appearing
randomly
for like 120ms
hi‚•πcause u didnt put a 404 page
under src/pages
when have u had this domain?‚•πok so you know Surge right
it is literally the best thing
how to deploy a Gatsby site with surge:
i now need to learn about CMS‚•πquick
what do i put‚•πum
not rust
rust makes me feel
insecure
so does my password‚•πi need something that makes me secure‚•πFaceID‚•πhaha
something else‚•πContentful CMS‚•πactually that works‚•πwait akhil you used surge right
when you did the tutorial
for gatsby‚•π*cough
i did the tutorial
but i kinda cut it short around data
to try stuff‚•πno it was like the end of step 2
surge is for deployment‚•πno i did like the introduction stuff
like the very beginning beginning‚•πakhil
go to your gatsby project
and install surge
from npm
then run this‚•πyea ik but i dont need that right now‚•πno try it
its like‚•πill do it at a later date‚•πreally nice
my problem with gatsby is that it is strictly jamstack‚•πHey cy
you should look into JWTs
they are really cool
it's a signed token basically‚•πI see
i could do that
but
i am looking at Contentful CMS rn‚•πI wrote my own CMS‚•πi will be making a jamstack app‚•πkinda‚•πsee i could do everything myself
but
i am embarking
on a project
where my goal
is to write‚•πI am‚•πas few lines
of code
of my own
as possible‚•πin rails
and I'm like
done with the authentication part already‚•πyou think you can make a website in 2 hours in rails
i think
i could make
a website
with jamstack
in 20 mins
if i get good at it‚•πI
am rusty with rails
if I actually remembered I would like
be done by now‚•πthe thing is‚•πwith the entire thing‚•πwith jamstack
you are production ready
very quickly
which is why i really like the prospect
if someone has an idea for a website
i can make it
with extreme speed
and have it to them
very quickly‚•πYeah‚•πbut such speed only comes with proficiency‚•πI can do the same with rails
and since I detest js
I will write rails‚•πhow do you deploy rails‚•πwdym
you use bundler‚•πwhat are the steps‚•πand call like
i havent done it before
you have to like just do like
bundle install production probably
no
idk‚•πcuz like
jamstack‚•πyou set an environment variable
soemthing something‚•πits as fast as like
one command
and the website is online
public
and production ready
obviously if you want more control you use like
netlify‚•πsee
rails is backend‚•πsee jamstack‚•πalso you can use heroku with rails‚•πhas very little backend‚•πso I can just do
git push heroku master
and then
it deploys‚•πbut scalability?
hmm
see i am trying
to figure out
what the superior form of web dev is
or at least‚•πThere is none‚•πwhat the advantages/disadvantages are‚•πI think each form of web dev has certain prospects to it
Yea this‚•πlike if i am making codetools
probably not jamstack
but‚•πrails is my favourite‚•πthe thing is
have you experimented with jamstack‚•πwhat is jamstack
lol‚•πlol
its highly js based
and it goes against like
70% of your ideals‚•πwhat
is it composed of‚•πJavascript
API
Markup‚•πok
nvm‚•πthe reason was like
this guy on youtube
made a
"production ready real-time chat app"
with sign in
in "8 minutes"
more like
20-30
but like
with jamstack
and he wrote 0 backend code‚•πidk
i just
i cant js‚•πi see
idk imma give it a try
idk what for tho
i might try and redo codetools in it
even tho like
that's not particularly productive
i wanna figure out how to integrate react into codetools
without making it slow
also ramesh‚•πit's a static site generator
like gatsby
and like
hugo and whatnot
The only difference is I wrote the static site generator‚•πi see‚•πYou can literally see if you want
I'm going to add asciidoc support to it‚•πis there like
a readme‚•πno
i
should add one
Like I agree but im lazy‚•πi see‚•πim getting tired of my junk markup language
so i wanna use asciidoc
no code required for validation
just this‚•πIntelliJ‚•πYes
It does fancy stuff‚•πGatsby is starting to get mildly illogical
the style property in JSX
has to be
a
dictionary
which means
i cannot just
paste it
into a css file
and have it auto format‚•πvs python
it went off the screen
granted this one is like
more logic in the python one
which I'll add to rails later
since I can actually do that
because its ORM
is actually not a hot mess‚•πi see‚•πim already on to the final part
uploading emotes‚•πi am trying to understand react
and gatsby‚•πI wanna standing table‚•πsame
i wanna make one
that seems fun‚•πk
rails emotes works
I just gotta add like a few minor things and it will be done‚•πso all these ppl are like
making blog examples with Gatsby
but
they never start from scratch
and they never like
show how to add new content
after publishing‚•πdont u like use the graphql thing to do it‚•πwell heres my issue
i believe you have to rebuild the entire site
every time you want a new path‚•πno‚•πlike for a new post‚•πum
no
wait mabye‚•πso im a little conflicted‚•πit may be
but thats not the worst thing to happen
like u make a post and then have something server side detect it and rebuild‚•πi see
tbh i think im suffering from a lack of a goal
atm
so maybe i should get a goal‚•πyea thats why i just left Gatsby for the moment
ill pick it up later
but i have other things to learn/do‚•πI wanna rewrite the editor frontend for CodeTools in react
so theres a goal
lemme go do that‚•π*copy and paste
copy it into react then create components for the things that get used more than twice‚•πyeah essentially
but then
add states
and hooks
and stuff
to make things nice‚•πand animation
i recommend React-Spring
its a physics based animation library thing‚•πidk im mostly dealing with Microsoft monaco
which will not be animated
imma look at more tutorials
bye‚•πhave fun
this is the most beautiful thing i have seen
RStudio is so nice
i dont know why i didnt use it before
aka this morning‚•πrails emotes is done‚•πhi i am not using gatsby
for CodeTools
i will use create-react-app‚•πHave fun‚•πi now have made a conclusion
Gatsby is for static sites that need good SEO
so it build everything
and makes it accessible with no js
but
create-react-app
lets me define a file
and place my react components
in one html element
which means
it is trivial to implement
especially for my application
that's also why you have to rebuild each time
when you make a new blog post
because
you need to generate that HTML
for the SEO
and load times‚•πI mean im not gonna be using it for a blog so
Its fine for me‚•πwhat are you gonna use it for‚•πLanding page‚•πyeah that's good
use Gatsby
whats funny
is that like
i wrote essentially my own react
for CodeTools
but actual react is much better
see part of it is react
part of it is not‚•πYea i figured
Huh‚•πyou dont understand
this is
cuz it means it works right with flask
and my jinja templates
and all that
and it means they do deliver on their promise
hi my name is cy
and i keep forgetting
what calls functions
and what references them
this guy is very helpful
he knows that ppl are idits
his tutorials are good
this is, by far, the best website you have ever encountered.
if this looked way better
you would not think
it was written
in fifty-eight lines of code‚•πbecause it's not
microsoft monaco is a lot of lines of code‚•πno
like
i mean
the rest of it‚•πah I can imagine though
writing this
in regular js
in like
10 lines of code‚•πcould you?
lemme see‚•πuse onclick
write two functions
and then replace the monaco text if they click on either
have two variables for the text‚•πit has to save
reload the page
it still is there‚•πyou mean
localstorage‚•πyes‚•πyou can do that in like 1 line‚•πand load it in
oh also
that 58 lines
is like
also the html‚•πoh
um‚•πcuz jsx
actually its more like 60 lines since i made a custom component for the buttons
which was
completely unneccesary‚•πvar dec 1 = from local storage else default
var dec 2 = from local storage else default

on click 1 { set monaco 1 }
on click 2 { set monaco 2 }

<button onclick = on click 1, onload = on click 1>thing</button>
<button onclick = on click 2, onload = on click 2>thing 2</button>

<script include monaco>

<monaco />
there‚•πthe buttons have to change color
also what is that
language‚•πadd that to the click
its
psuedocode‚•πok this is
58 lines
of
actual
code‚•πi doubt i need that much
but whatever‚•πtry it‚•πnah
also‚•πwhat‚•πnvm
it's just like
i keep trivializing your code
by saying it's bad‚•πyou didn't say it was bad
you just like‚•πin some way
like
i imply‚•πdid what ppl do‚•πthis‚•πwhen like
i do the same thing‚•πyeah ik
im trying to not be like that
i find it problematic‚•πi see
react is good
i like react
it is
logical
and i like
logic‚•πim just like
I really wish
some frontend language had
serde‚•πwhat‚•πserde‚•πthe web is very string based‚•πdo you know what serde is‚•πSerDe‚•πit takes json
and turns it into a struct
with associated methods
etc‚•πwhy do you need to transfer methods over the web‚•πI don't
but it's like easier to render a class
like I could in rust
write a trait called ToJSON‚•π*sigh
rust‚•πno
ToHTML
and then
I can just
call to html on my classes
and it can render the entire thing‚•πrust is a systems engineering language‚•πcan I take a json
and just
call to_html on it
in js
actually I probably could
hmm‚•πwhat would that do‚•πmaybe I should write a
frontend thing that does this‚•πno i dont get‚•πexcept like not in js‚•πwhat like
you want it to do‚•πin like python wasm
ok so
let's say‚•πpython wasm
what‚•πis a thing
anyway
let's say
i have a json.‚•πok.‚•π{ 'name': "Cy", 'picture': "10yearoldcy.png", "description: "Cy sees."}
okay
Now.‚•πYes.‚•πLet's say I have like.
A lot of these
10 of these
And I want a list of them‚•πok
wdym‚•πI am viewing a bunch of profiles after searching.‚•πa list‚•πwait
[{ 'name': "Cy", 'picture': "10yearoldcy.png", "description: "Cy sees."}, { 'name': "Ramesh", 'picture': "ramesh.png", "description: "Ramesh is blind."}, { 'name': "Akhil", 'picture': "movingakhil.gif", "description: "Akhil. Should. Go. Read."}]
Okay
so now
I get this from the REST API.‚•πok‚•πNow what I want is basically:
<div class="user">
    <h3>{{ name }}</h3>
   <p>{{ description }}</p>
   <img src="{{ picture }}" />
</div>
Three times.‚•πok so
lemme tell you how
there are 2 options‚•π<div>
<div class="user">
    <h3>{{ name }}</h3>
   <p>{{ description }}</p>
   <img src="{{ picture }}" />
</div>
<div class="user">
    <h3>{{ name }}</h3>
   <p>{{ description }}</p>
   <img src="{{ picture }}" />
</div>
<div class="user">
    <h3>{{ name }}</h3>
   <p>{{ description }}</p>
   <img src="{{ picture }}" />
</div>
</div>
I don't want to use React‚•πwell then theres one option‚•πOr any framework
And I hate fetch‚•πno there is no framework
and i assume you already have the data‚•πYes‚•πby some means‚•πIt's called a loop‚•πyou use
<template>
and
forEach
and‚•πwait
keep going
im typing‚•πthen you like
use
document.createElement
and
appendChild
and then
you have things
in fact
CodeTools does this‚•πI'm doing it in rust while typing
Like
you will see what I mean
Then
In my on click
to_html
is a helper function
That takes a ToHtml interfaced object
and calls to_html on the vec‚•πbut‚•πObviously this is POC‚•πhow is that supposed to run‚•πyew‚•πlol
‚Äúi dont wanna use a framework‚Äù‚•πI didn't say
I didn't want to use a Rust framework
I'm just
I realllly dislike JS‚•πbut from an efficiency standpoint...
also that is possible
just
like‚•πdo you see
why I like this‚•πyes
because
you dont wanna use js‚•πNo
It's because of the typing
I don't have to manually index json stuff‚•πGraphQL‚•πserde turns that json into a struct‚•πhas typing
and structs‚•πTypeScript
does typescript have this feature
since then I will look into typescript‚•πtypescript
has
types
hence the name‚•πDoes it have structs
like this
or classes
like this‚•πum‚•πYew seems like react in rust‚•πit relies on wasm
which is bad
do not rely on wasm‚•πSee
this is‚•πts has interfaces‚•πexactly what I want
this is literally what I was saying before
can it
turn json into its typed thing
and then like‚•πlook idk i dont use ts‚•πalso why shouldn't I use wasm
doesn't it work on phones‚•πit probably does but like
performance
is bad‚•πUm
Um
I thought that‚•πand also
firefox‚•πWASM was literally made for better performance
*yawn‚•πdoes not support multithreading‚•πI mean
if this tool works well for me I still wanna use it
If it makes web dev fun again‚•πi wanna see something made with it‚•πThen I will
make the emotes interface with it‚•πno like right now‚•πin a bit
i gotta submit some work‚•πno one that exists
already‚•πthat
someone spammed it
this is more useful‚•πtheres no
wasm‚•πthere is
it worked for me‚•πi see‚•πlol
chrome issues‚•πidk
its just like
im here to make flexible, scalable, reliable web apps‚•πsafari
again
tell me when JS can do what I showed you with serde
and I will gladly look into it‚•πuse react‚•πdo you want to see how I wrote the emotes cli v2
i literally
removed a lot of code
and used this serde thing‚•πalso like
i dont get how like
idk
i kinda wanna learn rust
but
i have no use for it‚•πthat's what I said as well
but it is useful‚•πwell for you‚•πi mean
cli applications‚•πyou are a systems person‚•πkinda
i could write it all in bash if I wanted to
also multihangman is a thing
i still want to destroy diesel and find a better orm
that's why I haven't been working on it
i hate the rust orm
i hate. it.‚•πorms are for relational databases‚•πyeah um
the arangodb one is bad too
i thikn the only one that I can tolerate is the mongo one
but‚•πm o n g o d b
n o s q l‚•πsomeone wrote a couchdb crate‚•πi like react
its good‚•πI tried it‚•πif you have not used react‚•πI couldn't stand it‚•πwhy
other than js‚•πI remember it being really obtuse
I really liked vue though‚•πwhat
how is it
obtuse‚•πlet me find my old code
this‚•πyeah but if you know react you can do react native‚•πi think it's on a pi somewhere
flutter‚•πno‚•πactually maybe ill write my applications in kotlin‚•πflutter is bad
ios‚•πOooooh
web apps
dont even mention active record
nothing is as good
Active Record is THE standard for orms‚•π*sigh‚•πwhat
maybe ill try sinatra‚•πi like‚•πit might be a good balance‚•πuse only
very popular things‚•πyou should not‚•πif i can‚•πalso rails is popular
shopify is written in rails‚•πyes‚•πand there is a lot of documentation for it
on the web‚•πbut i wanna write my next app with jamstack‚•πrails has react integration
i used react a little in this‚•πRuby‚•πlemme find the file
and then
it's a mess
since this is react
like wtf is this
like why cant i make this
in pseudocode:
<input a="field[]" onclick="addField" />
def addField
{ document.getElementById(parent).add(input_component.to_html()) }
no
but you get the idea
one more for remove
and that's it‚•πidk i like react
its better
than like‚•πI can't stand it‚•πwriting everything myself‚•πyeah I agree‚•πi effectively wrote my own react‚•πbut imma try vue‚•πfor CodeTools‚•πno not vue
yew‚•πyew
ok
try that
make something simple
then show me‚•πI will
hey cy
what should I make‚•πwith Yew?‚•πyes
ill try something‚•πthe same thing i made
with react‚•πok‚•πit must be identical‚•πthe styling may be different‚•πmine has like
no styling‚•πwhatever‚•πthe header is red‚•πill figure this out tomorow
i have work it seems
bye‚•πbye‚•πHaha
He just settled for an Xbox and other compensations‚•πboth sigh‚Äôs are good to go
cy and sai
hi ramesh
i will start rewriting codetools in react
which should be relatively straightforward
because i put most of the css in a css file
rather than leaving it on the elements
which i would have to translate‚•πjdkjfkjf
words
yayay this works‚•πwhat works‚•πmy proxy‚•πah
but now
go to‚•πok
it work‚•πhmm
ok‚•πbirds by coldplay is a great song‚•πok
i listen‚•πYes
it's in english too‚•πlol‚•πBirds go woof‚•πwhat does the fox say‚•πmy phone‚Äôs wifi
is broken
*sigh
and my laptop
greenscreened‚•πah nice‚•πIRQL not less or equal‚•πthis works now
including syntax highlighting‚•πthis doesn't work
also im now working on rebuilding CodeTools with react‚•πRamesh likes SCSS
should I turn my blog into a static site blog template
like anyone can use it
like hugo
I was thinking about it
Markdown links:

(complicated bracket)[idk if this bracket is the link or not]‚•π*cough‚•πtf
are those
and why do you have so many‚•πthey are pictures
of math problems‚•πi see‚•πto load into a file‚•πi am using react
and i like it
it like
is logical
and it doesn't trigger my spaghetti alarm
like vanilla js does‚•πIdk
I think imma write the serde thing in js‚•πok‚•πElm:
Nix:‚•πim thinking of making some sort of like
implementation
where like
clients can connect to an MQTT broker
and then the server can publish reload requests
so that like
lets take the codetools example
if a teacher changes the code
it signals to all the open clients
to reload their page
hi im the newly styled modal‚•πi made a decision
toooo much box-shadow
way too much‚•πyeah i thought so too
so i lessened it a bt‚•πgood
imma write emotes's ui in yew
why?‚•πu dont need that much shadow‚•πI have an emotes cli‚•πlemme tell you
it looks better‚•πso I write the emotes cli in rust‚•πnot in a jpg
over telegram‚•πoooo‚•πand then
no i write the emotes client in rust
as a library
and then the web UI and the CLI call the same thing‚•πyou can also write them both in js‚•πno‚•πhmm
smart‚•πI already wrote this code
so
i just have to tweak the structs a bit‚•πno im just saying like‚•πand the endpoints
so i dont need to write it again‚•πthis is not rust exclusive‚•πI know
but serde is
serde is something both kotlin and rust have
but I ruled out kotlin despite its being able to do react
just because I looked at react and I felt it was complex‚•πimma work on my fancy loading bar‚•πplus the shared codebase thing
serde is THE killer feature every language needs‚•πplease make it an actual loading bar‚•πi dont get serde
no i cant do that‚•πit's basically it turns your json into a class‚•πalso it only appears for like‚•πwhic means‚•π0.5s‚•πyou can call methods  on it‚•πbut
how
does it like
convert
the scripts‚•πit uses a rust compiler plugin
called a derive
aka it gets all the fields and sets them as instance variables‚•πso essentially your whole code could be in a serde‚•πit takes the thing like
a.a = json['a']
a.b = json['b']..
and automates it for you‚•πum
cant you like
destructure
an object‚•πno
i mean
not in python no
in js you can do a.a
but you cannot do
you cant
validate the models
so if some field is blank when serializing
you have to do that manually
serde will just take that field
and check
ok is this blank?
throw error if blank
if you tell it to
with an annotation‚•πum
im a little lost as to the use
of this
but
ok‚•πok
so
listen
you know what an ORM is
yes‚•πnot really‚•π*sigh
you know how mongodb is literally just
glorified json
bson or whatever‚•πyes‚•πtheres a mongoid library
for ruby at least
it's called mongoid
but
what it does:
it takes your mongo things
and turns them into ruby classes
with instance variables and objects‚•πah
ok
so i get that‚•πserde
does this
without mongo
so instead of mongo
you can use it
with your own apis‚•πidk
its like
you still have to like
define
lots of things‚•πyes
but it's not that bad
and it's useful‚•πtype safety is nice
but
type unsafety
is much easier‚•πnot with serde
literally every single rust project uses serde
like ok
what you do is
i have a config file
i define a config struct
serde
will turn the file into a struct
and I can have methods on the struct
etc
whereas
you have to deal with a json object without that
like type safety is just like
easier to read‚•πso its effectively
a class‚•πand easier to deal with
yes‚•πthat you can populate
with an api‚•πyes
but im saying you can extend this‚•πi see‚•πso I add
like
save()
and delete()
and it can do http requests
so I do like
a.get(1)
a.delete()
that doesnt exist yet but like‚•πok‚•πserde makes it easy to do this‚•πimma work on my loading bar
bye‚•π*sigh
bye‚•πhi
prettier
made my
4 simple modals
80 lines long
like expanding things to make them look nice is ok
but this...‚•π'murica‚•π‚Äòdrump
i am looking through the prettier settings
to make it stop
doing this
to my code
hi wanna tip
to make your code 200 lines shorter
set your prettier settings correctly
That‚Äôs 40%!
codetools-vanilla is at about 600 lines rn
codetools-react is at about 400 lines rn‚•πInt√©ressant‚•πnumworks done charging‚•πNice dark room‚•πfor full lights
for no lights
for half
and so on‚•πWhy not 0 for no‚•πbecause‚•πAnd like equal to full‚•πrealize
no
if you do it like this
then
it goes up
the keyboard
also 0 and 100 compete for 0s
and 100 has more 0s
so it should get 0
lol‚•πI see
I am stupid
I forgot 0 is next to 9
Not 1‚•πlol
this is not programming
0 comes last
not first‚•πYea i just saw it so
Yea
Idk what to do anymore‚•πcodetools-react is nearing completion‚•πoooo fancy‚•πits not all react
but
the editor
which is the actual interactive stuff
is being rewritten‚•πHuh‚•πthe rest of the app is like
literally
a login screen
and a myAccount screen‚•πNice one‚•πi fixed it
my making more
async functions
lol wait

hi my name is the MX Master 3
my back button‚•πJesus tf‚•πgoes back

then
it goes back twice
then
then‚•πum what‚•πthen
it goes back
3 times‚•π?
what does ur back button even do?‚•πevery click of everything except L/R click
is registering 3 times‚•πum
idk what to say
cause mine register once
except mabye the gestures‚•πlol now its doing it 4 times‚•πthose i usually have to do it a certain way‚•πwtf‚•πum
thats not good
id say‚•πi think its the options software‚•πget ur mouse exchanged
i mean possible‚•πcuz if i mess with it
it changes things
also rebooting my PC fixes it‚•πidk man‚•πhi im interested in rebooting rn‚•πdo u have the mouse drivers?
those r things id assume
mx master drivers‚•πi need to terminate Logitech options
and restart it
i need to figure out how to do that‚•πum quit
idk i think mine always runs in the background
but its so neglible that it doesnt do anything
like the app isnt even open‚•πidk its breaking stuff
i need to find it
and kill it
wait now we‚Äôre back down to 3 registers‚•πwhat if
u somehow have like 3 instances of the app?‚•πyeah that's what im thinking
something like that‚•πeither use the terminal‚•π3 but
like‚•πand like find the pid that way or just like look up logitech options on that
just kill em all‚•πok
hi akhil
now my scrolling doesn't work‚•πum what??‚•πother than R/L click‚•πdoesnt ur comp handle scrolling?‚•πwell not for this fancy shmancy mouse‚•πlike my comp works on everything xcept for the fancy thumb button
but i usually just turn off the mouse and on again‚•πwell no if you dont enable Options
it works fine
on its own
idk
i restarted Options
and now
all is well
smh
now to figure out why 2 http requests
that are the same
do
different things‚•πtf does activity monitor say
why do i have virtual memory size
and then real‚•πvirtual memory
is the ram you downloaded‚•πyes‚•πah i see‚•πakhil‚•πreal memory is the ram that comes with the computer‚•πur dumb‚•πmakes sense‚•πexactly
smh akhil‚•πwait
what if
i could use
cloud memory
like‚•πyou can‚•πah‚•πon plan 9
you can mount ram
cpus
gpus
and everything else‚•πwhat is plan 9‚•πthats so cool‚•πit's like
the failed successor to unix‚•πimagine mounting all ur ram from different machines‚•πthat basically is like a distributed OS
so they can share files and resources‚•πi see
i need to debug my http requests
for codetools-react‚•πi mean
but does really anyone like that‚•πemot‚•πyes‚•πi need to do my http requests
bye‚•πi need to do english and gym
i dislike doing a one minute video for gym‚•πwait
im gonna do
github dns‚•πum‚•πthat is a thing‚•πthat is a thing?
why have i not heard of this
right u reminded me‚•πidk how they did it‚•πi need to actually add an ssh key to my github‚•πnot
github dns‚•πand mabye a gpg key idk yet‚•πim wrong‚•πokay i was about to say
i need that in my life
how does one generate a gpg key?‚•πthis is the
provider
im gonna use‚•πyes
this is bueno‚•πwait
i send u my token‚•πcloudflare has a dns‚•πit doesnt work‚•πidrc‚•πfor wildcard certificates
for freenom domains‚•πum yea‚•πsmh
that took a hot minute‚•πk lets try this
ah more chinese stuff‚•πI mean cloudflare has a dns
Or
Hear me out
Why not make ur own
Bind took a hot minute to configure‚•πat this point
ill just
use the chinese dns‚•πsure
but u could always host ur own
just forward 53 to a debian machine that hosts bind
and bam dns
Tencent
damn they r like Tata‚•πhow about we try this AFTER
i get emotes to even work
to run‚•πForward to reverse lunge: Gluteus, Hamstrings, Quadriceps, Core
dont mind that
i just need to write it somewhere so i can say it‚•πrails is gonna be a pain‚•πHeroku?‚•πRamesh Uses NixOS‚•πcloud foundry?
u can use heroku on nix‚•πno
heroku
is cloud‚•πto deploy
but idk i usally just host my stuff‚•πmy wifi is broken
on my phone
it just
refuses
to connect
ive been on cellular since yesterday
cuz i havent had a chance to reboot the router‚•πcool
that's good‚•πi see‚•πim setting up a dockerfile for rails
i gave up on nix
im gonna run it using virtualisation.oci-containers‚•πmy phone is starting to refuse to install apps
it doesn't have enough storage‚•πwhen you get a 100 on a physics test‚•πwhen you never get less than a 95 on a bio test
the whole year‚•πsame with me with physics
because
retakes exist‚•πwith no retakes‚•πIn fact I think the lowest I got was like a 96
yes also the retakes
only let you retake the problems you got wrong
and if you fail you lose no points‚•πi did no retakes in bio
i was like‚•πok cy‚•πreally good‚•πi dont like bio‚•πat bio‚•πi got a 70
on one of the tests‚•πi see‚•πi disliked chem less
i like physics
ha
I gave up
ill do my thing tomorrow‚•πi forgot to define the function‚•πit's not that hard since it's no longer using nix‚•πlemme go define the function‚•πk
imma add yew to emotes soon
if i can get the thing to deploy‚•πok‚•πjoe biden
dot com‚•πyes‚•πthat is like
an easter egg‚•πyes‚•πthey use varnish
also it's gone now
no wait
https‚•πim not interested in your uncontrolled input‚•π2-*sigh
discord
is dead
this is painful
Um
Hi
Is school at 7:35 or 8 today
Anyone pwease‚•π8
Its a normal Wednesday‚•πcool‚•πYES
Finally
How did it take this long‚•πI had it already‚•πsend link‚•πno
i mean it depends on the price‚•πu gonna buy too‚•πmaybe
send link
im in the market atm
if the price is legit then it's probably real‚•πWhoops‚•πLol‚•πLol‚•πBruh it‚Äôs not letting me it‚Äôs on AliExpress‚•πyou can buy things on aliexpress‚Ä¶‚•πlol aliexpress
that's like‚•πi've done it before‚•πgearbest
i ordered a 3d printer from gearbest‚•πask on a discord‚•πand it took
2 months
to arrive‚•πi got banned from this
because i said that vaccination stock was bad
so they were like "stop saying this"
and i was like "where"
and they just banned me instaed
good solution tbh‚•πim trying react native
ideally i can get an app on ios as well
but that requires mak‚•πyup‚•πvm‚•πand an ifone‚•πthis
nah u dont need one i think
xcode has ios sims‚•πi need an iphone
for testing things
but
yes
i could use a vm
i want one with GPU acceleration ideally‚•πif u want ill just test stuf if u need it‚•πno i wanna do it myself‚•πthen yea a sim prob will be ur best bet
unless u have an actual iphone
u could load it onto‚•πi have only an iPod Touch with ios 12
I need a good mac vm‚•πum
just get an image and load it‚•πwdym‚•πu prob can get an ios iso‚•πmac iso?‚•πyea whatever
osx‚•πok but
i need to run it
with GPU acceleration
cuz otherwise
it just is like
unusable‚•πVmware fusion‚•πhi that's a mak thing‚•πVmware workstation‚•πthat kosts monie‚•πIs free‚•πno it told me
you get 30 days‚•πUm
I got fusion for free‚•πfusion
is
mac‚•πIk
But im pretty sure workstation is the windows counterpart‚•πi mean alternatively i could just get an iso and boot it
directly‚•πAnd it has a free one for startups/personal‚•πbut also
it didn't work
it did
but
no gpu acceleration
so it was like
really slow‚•πHmmm‚•πgraphically‚•πThats weird‚•πi mean it was fast
like in benchmark
but
there is no gpu
so all the graphics
are just like
not
appropriate‚•πHuh
Thats really weird
Hmmmmm‚•πsee the other issue is that like
im using Ryzen
and most of the macos vms are for intel‚•πYea
It should still work‚•πlemme look up more tutorials‚•πYea u should
I wanna like reinstall osx
But im very confident that some files that i really need will be lost‚•πlol is this all i have to do‚•πVirtualbox?‚•πno that's vmware‚•πHuh
If it is
That would be very easy
Oof‚•πim not actually using the latest version
the tutorial said
it only works
on this version‚•πHuh
Idk fusion has a button called gpu acceleration
I need to make my windows vm tho
Hmm‚•πmaybe i could make it work with VirtualBox‚•πProbably
I dislike virtualbox unless its for linux vms
Then its fine‚•πits free tho
i mean
i could also try
hyperv‚•πU could
Should i make a osx vm‚•πi mean sure
but like
ur on a mac
so
i would not assume it to be that hard‚•πIts super fricken ez
Cause all macs have recovery partitions
So if u just add a drive and boot a vm into the partition
Itll install mac‚•πThe products were only for preorder
sadge
they are bulk selling mining cards tho‚•πOoo thats cool
Um
Why r dr seuss seuss books trending‚•πthey are banning them
they are ceasing publishing
certain ones
because they are
racist‚•πWait actually?‚•πyes‚•πDamn‚•πit was on TV yesterday‚•πThose books were so good tho‚•πjust 6 are being banned
dammit why u have to use mediafire‚•πUm
I would recommend catalina‚•πno
i will use
big sur‚•πIf u say so‚•πr u making a vm or hackintosh?‚•πvm‚•πI dislike big sur‚•πyes we know
but i want the latest version
regardless‚•πFair‚•πIts glitchy, but if u want to update software its necessary‚•πbtw i wasnt kidding‚•πcreate a recovery image with a tool its much faster‚•πwhat tool‚•πfollow this to get the file
dont do any of the other stuff its for hackintoshing‚•πthat's the terminology page
you sent me‚•πthere is the page for creating it in windows
what gpu do you have‚•πRadeon RX570‚•πok thats fine‚•πbut im trying to make a vm‚•πik but you can use this to get the recovery
wait nvm‚•πtbh idk what i even need‚•πI forgot it was different file types
honestly just hackintosh its not that hard‚•πwdym
i need like
a drive
to install it on‚•πThats gonna take forever‚•πno kidding‚•πyou can partition the one you have and install it on half‚•πmatthew.
i just
like
upgraded
my ssd
cuz i used it entirely
i will not spend‚•πthen what happened to the old one‚•πmy precious
500gb
i mean i could do it on that one
true‚•πhackintoshing to big sur is the most difficult what cpu u got?‚•πRyzen 5 3600‚•πthats fine
it will just emulate a intel one‚•πwait
what if
i hackintoshed
my laptop
its intel
i saw some guy
at a hackathon‚•πif it has a touchscreen it loses that functionallity‚•πwho had hackintoshed
a yoga 720
with touch
he came to me he said
oh i have the same laptop
but mine runs macos
and i have a touchbar
on my screen‚•πwow
if u need help let me know
good luck‚•πi need help‚•πoh ok‚•πthe only reason i want macos
is for ios development
and testing purposes‚•πwait‚•πso i dont need much
but‚•πu have workstartion pro right?‚•πi do need
yes‚•πtry workstation player‚•πi have that
how do i
like
run my workstation pro images
on workstation player‚•πjust like import it‚•πhuh‚•πits like a universal image i think
they all use the same filetype so that u could import it
wait‚•πwait
hold on
its‚•πno that wouldnt work‚•πbooting‚•πoh oh its doing something‚•πIs that the vm?‚•πyes
a a a a a a p l e‚•πthats not good‚•πah its broaken‚•πWTF‚•πhold on‚•πthats crazy‚•πdoes it work
like gpu acceleration‚•πif this has gpu acceleration
ill be damned‚•πyeah I had a vm too but it was super slow‚•πlol no gpu acceleration‚•πah‚•πoof‚•πminimizing a window‚•πwait‚•πstill like
locks up the system‚•πdo u think
that if i make a working mac vm
and send it to u‚•πi had to follow a very long set of instructions‚•πit would have gpu acceleration‚•πto get this working
on my AMD‚•πhmm‚•πi can probably enable it‚•πjust hackintosh it takes 2 days max‚•πyeah but then i need to like
boot into it
which is a pain‚•πnope you can dualboot‚•πwell but i still need to shut down windows
which is a pain‚•πoh‚•πi need to go to class‚•πum what‚•πWho needs 3d acelleration anyways‚•πi mean i would like it‚•πi need to be able to minimize a window
without my system hanging
for a minute‚•πthats the problem with VM's I had the same issue even on intel and the igpu‚•πAPUSH:
HUSH:‚•πoo‚•πwhy is the teacher playing japanese music‚•πi wonder
lol‚•πLol
Lol
ramesh forgets
json exists
waot‚•πsomeone tell me why react native wont compile
imma erase it and start over
shoot
no
my computer‚Äôs gonna bluescreen
why did i hit delete
see switching to react was nice
because
it meant much easier
things
like
title
like
if you change the title
it just updates the metadata state
which is automatically uploaded
so i can just add as many things as i want
as controlled inputs
and they will just
automatically update the metadata
and be uploaded to the server
with no extra code
fail quickly in order to succeed sooner
huh‚•πyeah‚•πplease help me‚•πwhats up[
do u have the bracket‚•πyes
im filling it out

for math?‚•πyes‚•πwdym a "live" video‚•πlike i have to solve the problem
while explaining‚•πum
do this
get like
a
box
or something
put ur phone on it
with the camera hanging off
or do the whole thing in LaTeX‚•πi mean i could
but i think she wants like paper pencil‚•πhold the phone with your left hand
write
with your right
or the other way depended on your handedness
apparently left-handedness is the dominant trait
idk how that works
I wanna learn to write with my left hand
i dont like this idea of handedness‚•πwait what?
i thought right handedness is dominant
wait‚•πwait
nvm
its not‚•πr they even traits‚•πit was something else
yeah its genetic‚•πthat makes sense
actually?‚•πi think so‚•πi thought it was just whatever u started doing as a child just sticks‚•πthat's what i think‚•πambidextrous was a genetic i think‚•πidk
science says its a trait
i say its not‚•πwell this is gonna be tough to record
i dont think i need my face in it tho so‚•πi say i can learn to write with my left hand
if i wrote things
which i dont
2021
maybe ill do all my math hw today with my left hand
just because
its the only thing i actually write‚•πTime to record in 720 on my phone
Whats the google classroom upload limit?
Or drive upload limit‚•πidk
25GB
or something
per file
or 100GB
idk‚•πHuh‚•πyou get unlimited storage tho
so that's not an issue
also how many mins
do you expect to record‚•π3-5‚•πok so like
if you compress
on telegram
you can like
get it to
7MB per minute‚•πDo i need it to tho?‚•πno
you dont
but just saying‚•πI think classroom can handle like 1gb upload‚•πidk‚•πAt 1080 60 a minute of video is 175 mb‚•πyou will not be above 1GB‚•πThats for sure
Yes
I need to find a box‚•πapple xBox

im dislike this alot

its really a problem‚•πtrig identity‚•πisnt it
ah‚•πverify the equation is true
and i gotta explain my work so‚•πwe never did if
we only did proofs

ok
now does it
i wanna try straight up booting the macos iso that i used for that vm
like natively
not as a vm‚•πTower‚•πTOWER‚•πIts the leaning tower of pizza‚•πpizza
Etcher is complaining
it doesn't like BigSur.iso
it says it wont boot‚•πNo boot partition
Yea thats also for windows
Use rufus
Itll add boot partitions‚•πhuh
ok‚•πWell it should
I used it for windows and it added it
So it should do the same‚•πit wont do it‚•πakhil
why
why
why
why do you put a lens
on top of that
if you drop the lens you lose tons of mon√¶‚•πdont worry
i dropped it
so its fine
i cant break something twice‚•πthis is a huh moment
1GB per second
using the cheapest NVMe usb reader on amazon
that's 8Gbps
which means that its actually using USB 3.2 Gen 2
cuz USB 3.2 Gen 1 tops out at 4Gbps
it also means that
the USB connection
might actually be the bottleneck
and not the reader
cuz USB 3.2 Gen 2 can do theoretical maximum of 10 Gbps
and this is getting real close‚•πThis
is what I have to do
it has now taken longer to build this package
than to just
write it‚•πhi ramesh
can you tell me
the right way
to backup
an ssd
like image the entire thing
like do you know any way
that does not involve

dd
also clonezilla

also cy sets up a light system

this disk is being imaged
Gnome Disks
is good
it just
images
my disk
i tested it with a flash drive
and it worked
flawlessly
so now its time for the real test
imma image this nvme
then
wipe it
and see if i can recover it
and have it still be bootable
when i tested on the flash drive it was still bootable
it was a windows installer media
i imaged it
wiped it
made some random partitions
filled them with some stuff
then
imaged it again
then
wiped it
then restored the windows install medium
it was still bootable
then i wiped it
and restored the second image
and everything was right where i left it
so i am confident
that this will work
but now i have to be doing AP Seminar bye
have you ever tried flashing a linux installer iso to an nvme drive
I blinked
and it was done
and consequently
all data that was on that nvme
should be gone
would you like to hear my relative speak about social geography

idk what a second aunt is tbh‚•πa second aunt
um‚•πso flipgrid just ike

and then
it doesn't upload‚•πa second aunt‚•πah
so like a distant relation‚•πits like one generation removed

through the LZMA2 Ultra compression algorithm
using 7zip
the results so far are not bad‚•πHmm
Im about to take the unit 8 test for chem
Im dying‚•πgl‚•πIts eh
Some were a bit weird
Why is it 300$‚•πchem test
ever
.‚•πyea‚•πIt was
awful.‚•πit was not so good‚•πin all ways‚•πthe mc was the hardest imo‚•πi did not finish‚•πhow‚•πi usually finish 20 minutes early‚•πi finished early‚•π21 questions‚•πyea with 15 minutes or so
yea‚•πand they're all formatted wrong
and they take forever to load
and the teacher is talking in the background
and we are not allowed to have our notes on our screen
we have to use another screen
to have our notes‚•πor u could have printed them‚•πsame thing‚•πthats what i did‚•πalso my periodic table
the interactive one
yes‚•πu couldnt click
on it im assuming
cause it would notify the teacher‚•πwe cant click out of the test window
so i have to use my laptop‚•πyup‚•πand then like
the boxes
are all
formatted wrong
its like
please
for the love of god‚•πright‚•πif you are making a test‚•πthey didnt subscript‚•πcheck it
before‚•πsome of them did‚•πassigning
to students
and then like
i get \text{OH}subs#usb_2)d{l)\
as the question
and its like‚•πYES
THIS WAS SO FRICKEN ANNOYING
cause its in latex‚•π*smh
i gtg to ap semminarre‚•πbut no one can just read latex code‚•πmr y is in a car‚•πthat's
funny‚•πmr y mr y
they are invading
they will take over
imma try and do some hackintosh business
which will likely fail but whatever‚•πThats um
Dangerous‚•πi was going to say
try opencore‚•πyeah imma try opencore
hes not driving
hes pulled over‚•πAh
Then its not as bad
I thought he was driving
While zooming‚•πno
now how do I make my opencore work
lets see‚•πOSX-KVM‚•πor yeah I could run it in linix
but‚•πOSX-KVM‚•πthat like‚•πmakes it really eays‚•πkinda
defeats
the purpose‚•πyeah good luck with windoze‚•πim not making a vm anymore
im making an actual one
that boots
from my nvme
that I wiped
and backed up
using Gnome disks‚•π*sigh
i was thinking of doing this‚•πi have one of those enclosures‚•πalso if you think linux is hard
to install
good luck with hackintosh
it's 20 times worse‚•πi dont
its really easy
you just flash the installer
then
run it
and it does everything for you‚•πyes good luck with your mak
uh
you have to like
manually configure the usb ports‚•πwait
virtualization doesn't work
so this is out of the question‚•πtbh
i would encourage hackintosh
like
baremetal‚•πwdym‚•πsince idk how to do it on windows
in a vm
so just install it on a drive‚•πno i want to use opencore‚•πuse opencore‚•πfor real
did you hear
this‚•πidk
why openscore is gone‚•πmy problem
is that
apparently these do not support virtualization
on AMD‚•πyou want to run
a mac vm
in osx‚•πno
i want to run an iOS vm
in macos‚•π*yawn
idk get an intel then‚•π*sigh‚•πor use
osx-kvm
since that works‚•πlink?‚•πOk hold on‚•πi‚•πU cant run an ios vm‚•πyou remember your stupid pi issues?‚•πYea‚•πso JP had the same issue
and he fixed it‚•πU can run a simulator‚•πby changing his subnet‚•πYea i also fixed it‚•πthat is a VM right‚•πWait really
Kinda‚•πit requires AppleHV tho i think‚•πidk
should I try installing osx-kvm‚•πimma do that now‚•πU know what the fix was‚•πbut i dont have enough storage‚•πIt has happened multiple times to me‚•πi could install a fresh version of linix
on my ssd
then‚•πI just had to close tmux and open it up again‚•πinstall macos‚•πyes
also you miht be able to
if you have another gpu
pass through your gpu‚•πi have 1 gpu
i want to pass through my gpu
i mean
i could like
go get another GPU‚•πyeah
i mean you can pass through your one gpu
it's just like
hard
you ahve to ssh into your desktop to set it up
since the display will break‚•πi see
wait
but then
how does
lemme just try the simple way
imma get some lubuntu
and put it on my nvme
or should I use Pop_OS
probably lubuntu
since its
better
*sigh‚•πwhat is this
dont use lubuntu
lubuntu is ugly
and garbage
use pop os‚•πbut its lightweight‚•πi mean
you could probably get away with ubuntu server
if all it's going to do is bootstrap a macOS vm‚•πright and then I could like
use ssh
and pass my gpu
the problem is‚•πor
virt-manager‚•πwhat is that‚•πit's a GUI manager for vm‚•πso if i use ubuntu server
and connect via ssh‚•πFor libvirtd‚•πthen i can pass through gpu‚•πyes‚•πbut
i need to connect
ubuntu
to wifi
hi welcome to my house‚•πNetwork manager‚•πok so i have 3 options for what to install on my nvme
1. lubuntu
2. pop os
3. ubuntu server‚•πThis‚•πum
ok‚•πUbuntu server will have everything u need
And its just nicer imo‚•πfor my macos vm
and then like
so
it will just like
take control of my display?
im a little confused‚•πyes
the gpu will get passed through and then it will pass through to your display‚•πbut
in order for my gpu to be passed through‚•πu have to disable the gpu
so there wont be any display output
until the vm starts‚•πah
and youre saying‚•πive also only gotten a single gpu passthrough to work on arch‚•πosx-kvm
will like‚•πand it took a few hours‚•πfind it automatically‚•πU could
Technically speaking‚•πno it will not‚•πAlso just like install proxmox‚•πso how to i make it do it‚•πthis
look at the github‚•πk‚•πalso
look at VFIO
not only does the bootloader exist
but it aims
to imitate macos
huh
this seems like
a bootloader one could use for lunix too‚•πI am now installing Ubuntu Server‚•πhave fun‚•πubuntu wants a network interface
but I have none‚•πare you using wifi‚•πyes‚•πyou need to like‚•πAh‚•πbcmwl-kernel-source‚•πactually it gives an option to install without network‚•πidk what wifi you ahve
yeah do that
then you can add the networking stuff later‚•πok
wait so I can first install the osx kvm thing
test if it works‚•πand then‚•πthen try gpu passthrough‚•πdo the gpu
yes‚•πok
A start job is running for Wait for Network to be Configured‚•πit will
time out‚•π1min 57s / no limit
wait
it timed out‚•πtold ya‚•πok now how do I do wifi‚•πidk
you have to find your wifi brand
like the adapter vendor
who makes your adapter‚•πits an intel I think‚•πwht‚•πbut its ASUS branded‚•πdo this‚•πok‚•πand show us what the output is
it
detects ur wifi
sudo apt intsall NetworkManager
then it will give you a nice
oh wait
you cant
haha
you cant because you dont have any internet‚•πlol‚•πi love this issue
um‚•πUm‚•πi can use my phone‚•πIp link whatever up‚•πas a usb ethernet‚•πyeah do that
me
i tried to sing
something‚•πWait doesn‚Äôt it detect it‚•πand it sounded awful
it should
oh wait
no
you can probably get this to work
with‚•πYea its just down i think‚•πwait for it
since ubuntu server is special snowflake
so they use‚•πIp link whatever up‚•πhi cy
nvm
just use your phone
you might have to use netplan with that tho‚•πhold on i had to connect a Bluetooth keyboard to my laptop
i am back‚•πThis i think will fix it‚•πok so how do i make it connect
to the internet‚•πyou use your phone‚•πi plugged it in‚•πdid it not work
ip -c a again
also without the -c flag
it wont work
most important command line argument‚•πYes‚•πuh
you have to use netplan‚•πIp link usb0 up‚•πor that
no it's
ip link dev usb0 up or something
or like
ip dev link usb0 up
idk‚•πU dont need the dev i think‚•πip link set dev <interface> up‚•πTry this first‚•πum
it worked
but
not
it is not
online‚•πIp -c a‚•πJust
Use‚•πalso how do i change my password‚•πNetplan‚•πi made it all caps by accident‚•πpasswd
Just that
I also typed poweroff in my computer instead of my vm
So my computer is off now‚•πlol its telling me‚•πGood job‚•πnew password
must
differ
from old password‚•πCaps
Lock‚•πby more than just case‚•πIs
Oh
You can probably change that
Google‚•π*SIgh
whatever ill just leave it as is
lol i just changed it to password
then changed it back‚•πlol
that also works‚•πok so now
how do i connect
to wifi‚•πdoes the regular thing work‚•πwdym‚•πlike
can you access google‚•πno‚•πip -c a‚•πdoes not work‚•πok
uh‚•πnot installed
wait
hold on‚•πum
you could like‚•πyea no
not installed‚•πno
no
no
just
do this
you have to put this in the netplan config
and change
the enp3s0 to usb0
or
this
for wifi
hmm‚•πok lemme do that
this will be painful‚•πyeah‚•πwithout copy paste‚•πnetplan is awful
nmtui
is a gui‚•πi just save to usb and copy over?‚•πin the terminal
no
you have to mount the usb‚•π*sigh
linix‚•πno
this is
the server version‚•πwhat should i do‚•πyou edit the
/etc/netplan‚•πok
lemme do that‚•πthis
see this‚•πwlp4s0
don't mind‚•πi do
sorry‚•πjust need to write it down‚•πjk
makes a nixos vm‚•πhi ramesh‚•πwith‚•πit still doesn't work‚•πyour entire directory there
did you netplan apply‚•πyes‚•πwhat does it say‚•πnothing‚•πip -c a
get rid
of the ethernets thing
also thanks for your wifi password‚•πok
lol‚•πalthough i dont really care‚•πwifi no work
still‚•πfine
then
put back the enp7s0 thing
and change that
to usb0‚•πi deleted it
um
under ethernets?‚•πyes
put the usb0
with dhcp true‚•πok
ok it works
but not wifi obviously‚•πok NOW‚•πbut now i can install things‚•πsudo apt install NetworkManager‚•πunable to find package‚•πget rid of the like
networkmanager
oh wait
wait
wait
wait
sudo apt update
then try the NetworkManager again‚•πi mean that
and its not NetworkManager
on ubuntu/debian
its network-manager‚•πoh
i didnt know‚•πk now what‚•πyea its NetworkManager i think on arch
nmtui‚•πyou might have to‚•πsudo nmtui‚•πmaybe
but i was thinking
the systemctl service‚•πright start
u also have to disable netplan somehow i think‚•πsudo apt remove netplan‚•πnetplan is not installed, not removed‚•πok good
then it took care of that for you
just nmtui‚•πok
ok so now I'm online‚•πnow you can just
do what osx-kvm says‚•πyes lemme try that
over ssh
ok‚•πit might not work though
it opens a window‚•πum
then how should i do it‚•πum
you could use ssh X forwarding I think
but it's a pain
so what I would reocmmend
is using the libvirt xml that they give
and then using virt-manager to connect‚•πwdym
i want it on the display output
from the pc‚•πyou can't do that
until‚•πwhy‚•πyou install it
and then
pass through the gpu‚•πi see‚•πI mean you can‚•πshould i just do that then‚•πyes‚•πok‚•πyou can try doing it first‚•πfirst lemme install it‚•πi mean‚•πand see what it does‚•πthis link‚•πcant u just install virt-manager on ur comp‚•πhe can
but you have to do an extra step
to add the vm to libvirt
normally it just uses qemu
im getting epilepsy from macos booting up
in verbose mode‚•πlol‚•πnah
the sound‚•πi actually felt like throwing up‚•πthat is both a blessing and a curse‚•πi love the sound
but then my parents can hear it‚•πcause its so loud‚•πwhat do i pick‚•πno
you use
read it‚•πi am doing that now
hi ramesh
the step to actually install
wants
gtk‚•πyes
did you
yeah that wont work‚•πso what do i do‚•πdont use this‚•πno‚•πgtk is the graphical environment
which i don't have‚•πstop
wait‚•πim waiting‚•πuse this‚•πneed to install anything?‚•πyes
libvirt‚•πok
how
apt install libvert‚•πyes‚•πno
not package‚•πsigh
idk‚•πwait‚•πlook it up‚•πu need like a billion packages‚•πno
libvirt ‚â† kvm
but that's another thing‚•πthey install libvirt‚•πlook up how to install libvirt on ubuntu server
ok
then it's fine‚•πk so now i did that
but‚•πi was lazy to paste the command‚•πhow do i use virt manager
how to i connect to my vm
also‚•πvirt-manager
on windows‚•πwill this work with the gpu passthrough‚•πno
but
that is a later step‚•πok so let's install virt-manager on windows‚•πthere is a win
surprisingly‚•πwait they do?‚•πyes‚•πhow to i install it
it gave me like
a whole folder
?‚•πwhat‚•πum isnt there an msi installer that u can download‚•πtheres
an msi‚•πwhere
lol
i should have just used lubuntu‚•πperhaps
probably
it would kill the wm anyway
and X
so‚•πbut it would connect to wifi
easily
and it would let me test in the GUI
meh
ok its installed now what‚•πopen it
add a connection
to ur desktop‚•πum
what is the connection‚•πlike‚•πip‚•πthe ip
is there a prefix?‚•πum no‚•π24‚•πor anything
ok‚•πits the default‚•πalso check the ssh one i think
um
uncheck ssh
wtf
oh
qemu+ssh://USER@IP/system
wait
did you download virt-viewer‚•πyes‚•πno
use
virt-manager
not virt-viewer
that is why this is not working‚•πum
where do i get the msi for that‚•πum
oh ramesh id umb‚•πdidnt he install virt viewer?‚•πyou have to use wsl
it doesnt work on windows‚•πwsl
has no
graphics‚•πwith xming‚•πwhat‚•πjust do this
and now you see why i use linux
because i dont wanna do this lol‚•πi could have use Lubuntu‚•πyea
why dont u
reintsall‚•πshould i‚•πno
use
kubuntu
kde is just as lightweight‚•πbut that's heavier‚•πalso to gpu passthrough
it kills the DE
so‚•πyes
but‚•πit's not changing the amount of resources being used‚•πif i choose not to‚•πthen
lubuntu will suck
kubuntu won't
like‚•πalright fine
fine
fine‚•πif you want to use it as a linux
yes‚•πi don't tho but ok
so I'm reinstalling
starting from scratch
ok‚•πyeah but you won't need to deal with the wifi‚•πtrue
also the installer is bigger
lubuntu's installer is really small
well
smaller
1.8gb‚•πnixos: want to use our stuff? NO you ahve to go all in with the nix ecosystem
use nix-shell
etc‚•πrather than 2.5‚•πok but
lxde
or lxqt‚•πplatform lockin‚•πis awful
it doesnt even‚•πhas entered the chat‚•πhave
a compositor
it will have zero animations
and it will be ugly
and awful‚•πi have used it
it is fast‚•πrasbpian‚•πreal fast‚•πis
different‚•πno not raspbian
i have used lubuntu
the latest one
since they added search to the start menu
it is fine
but
I'm downloading
kubuntu
so
that's that‚•πkde's also fast and lightweight‚•πthe animations are not
they are bad‚•πi think they're fine‚•πthey look fine‚•πmeh idc anymore
i just want
something
that works
and i don't wanna argue
so im using
kde‚•πkali linux‚•πalso idrc‚•π4 of which are in the printer and are half full‚•πso like‚•πjust use kde
or‚•πoh is it not working because i took out the ram and forgot to put it back in again‚•πI'm using kubuntu
it is now flashing
also this means i will be able to open the tutorial on the actual computer
and not have to use my laptop
which is awful
and i don't like using it
its small
and slow
and its gpu is dying
literally
things go black
and get blocky
on my screen‚•πi mean mine does that sometimes‚•πwindows
developer perview‚•πbut that was when i had 15 windows open‚•πprobably‚•πeach running like 100 tabs so it made sense‚•πthe hell
funky smelling output‚•πIt is what it says it is
funky smelling output
what r we in the 80s?‚•πhelp I'm stuck in full screen
and i can't get out‚•πwdym
full screen
f11?‚•πthe qemu‚•πah
control alt g?‚•πnot work‚•πyou could kill it
why does control alt g not work‚•πno i just like
wanna get out of the window‚•πyes
control alt g‚•πalso the display is not scaled right‚•πor like‚•πlike‚•πcontrol shift g‚•πits‚•πthe mouse is stuck
right‚•πnot the right resolutoin
yes
it is stuck‚•πcontrol shift or alt g
it says at the top‚•πwait ctrl alt f
that works‚•πim dumb
wait
it seems im running deployment mode wrong
im like
surprisingly making progress on the nixos thing rn‚•πwhich room cy‚•πidk
I'm on a phone
so like‚•πworkspace 400?‚•πok
i believe i got the gpu passthrough working
but
now there's some other issue‚•πI had an idea
On demand mac vms for friends
With gvt-g‚•πi want my own mac vm‚•πSo you have gpu accel
Cy‚•πwhat is this‚•πWhy
Not correllium
you should just
get a correllium‚•πi want a fast one
that is not
remote
and does not cost
money‚•πisn't correllium fast‚•πit is remote
and it costs money
also i almost have this qemu thing working
wanna call‚•πNo‚•π*sigh‚•πi never
agreed to help you‚•πlol‚•πCorrellium and what u r doing are not the same u know right?‚•πyes
i do not want
i want my own vm
with gpu passthrough‚•πHave fun‚•πk‚•πhave fun as well
you may get gpu accelerated linux vms soon
nixos is fun
you specify a nix config
and it will give you a vm‚•πI mean i think correllium is the only company that makes ios vms‚•πdidnt it get cleared by the court?
i cant type since i took a walk and my hands are frozen‚•πCorrelliums did‚•πyeah‚•πBut globally and other companies no
I dont think so‚•πwhat do you think
powered by launchnix‚•πIs a good idea
I haven‚Äôt really learned nix but I‚Äôm assuming that it makes things easier‚•πno
it makes things harder‚•πOoo a queue‚•πthis‚•πHuh‚•πah
it crashed
this sounds like gpu sales‚•πYup
This is like the same thing‚•πjust like
dont say that in the atr stonks server
or you get banned
literally
if you say that
you get banned
without any explanation as to why
try it
maybe it's reproducible‚•πmabye
idk
but guess what time it is
actually this is gonna suck
cause my keeb is connected to a usb hub in my monitor
which connects to my mac
but i would have to like unplug it and plug it into the comp
to use it‚•πhi akhil
buy a kvm switch‚•πAh yes the best airflow ever
I dont know where id put it otherwise
Also the psu is downward intake
So idk
Tf is that?‚•πxeyes‚•πThose r eyes
Ehh i can see it
Should i lift it up?
Imma lift it up
With what is the question‚•πthat lens‚•πNah i only have one
Id need 2‚•πlol‚•πHonestly i could use some books‚•πI need to do
work‚•πBut that feels like disrespect to the book
Ah have fun‚•πramesh is not in ap comp sci today
th‚•πtf is that
okay
imagine ur having a debate
in zoom
and the teacher picks students to talk by whoever raises their hand
and u have ur hand rasied almost the entire time
but he never calls on you
what th do u do‚•πimagine ur having a debate
and your teacher
is on the highway
and leaves
the meeting‚•πhaha that was funny
im so pissed
i had my hand rasied‚•πyes i understand
but
are you like‚•πbut he called on people that raised their hands after me‚•πone of those ppl
who like
raises their hands all the time
and they always call on you‚•πi did this
nope
never‚•πyou see
in English
i always raise my hand
and she always calls on me
but then this one day
she like
refused
outright
to call on me
she was like
no
im done‚•πwell this is a debate‚•πim not calling on you anymore‚•πso he has to call on me
so that i can speak
but he didnt
at all‚•πlol then if you get a bad grade you can go and complain‚•πi tried so hard
yea mabye
i have to see
there is a listening part as well
aka notes‚•πi see
but you can see
if you got a bad grade
on the speaking‚•πhe said he noted whoever was trying to speak
so i may be fine
cause the groups were alot larger
having ur hand up is what i consider trying‚•πms baker is not starting the zoom meeting‚•πimagine
i am
ugh
forget it
ill complain to him
if i get a bad grade‚•πyes
now
i have to figure out
why
the meeting
is not‚•πcause she didnt start it
also i think he has a physics test today‚•πlol lesson
do not‚•πand didnt study for it
so thats prob why‚•πclick the meeting
before it starts‚•πyea
i always do a minute late or so
welp at least today is friday
so i can chill‚•πcy
did you fix your vm‚•πno‚•πthat was easy‚•πi almost made the GPU passthrough work
like i said‚•πwhat happened cy‚•πsee
so
i blacklisted amdgpu
then
i added the pci ids in a kernel parameter‚•πok‚Ä¶
yes‚Ä¶‚•πso then
i ran that script
on arch linux
wiki
and it said
the vfio was on
so then
but
it didn't work
it said it couldnt find the device
so then i opened the file
and changed the pci devices
it took several tries
but then
this happened:
it
like
the screen said some grub boot lines
that had stuck
from boot‚•πthat's good‚•πand then‚•πand then it stops
that is‚•πwhen i ran the script‚•πgood
oh‚•πthe screen went black‚•πbut then
it never
showed anything‚•πwent gray
then
died
and the monitor said
no signal
but
that is not the main issue
the main thing
was that
the qemu
said
it could not find sata2
and sata3
so then
i like
modified the file
at that point
qemu wasnt directly crashing
but
nothing was on the screen anymore‚•πqemu doesnt crash
the gpu doesnt passthrough right
when it goes grey that is a gpu passthrough issue
which is like
the issue i had too‚•πwell by gray i mean like‚•πidfk how I solved it btw‚•πthat gray
of a dead lcd
not being controlled‚•πyes that is a gpu passthrough issue I think‚•πwell but no
so
my monitor does this
it like
goes gray
no but ok
so
lemme describe 4 images
start:
2 lines saying boot initramfs or whatever
then (0.5s):
gray and dead
then (0.5s):
black
then
no signal
after i ran qemu‚•πwhat happens after running qemu‚•πthe screen essentially goes black
but
it does that thing
my screen does
when it starts up
and goes gray with a black line through it‚•πk‚•πbut then
it said no signal
and went to sleep‚•πyes
that is a gpu passthrough failure
you have to like
idk what i did
i did it on nvidia twice
and i have done it on my rx 580
on arch linux
it took a long time‚•πi have essentially this‚•πi dont think i had to play with the vbios‚•πbut what i dont get is like
if the passthrough failed
wouldnt it just not work
like it used to‚•πyes‚•πor throw an error‚•πthat is called no signal‚•πno‚•πand it doesn't do anything‚•πyou dont understand
before
it was like
not changing
it would just stay
on that grub leftover
after i set the pcie devices correctly‚•πyes
qemu fails to pass through‚•πwhat was on the screen
like
it actually interfaced with the GPU‚•πoh right
check your dmesg
i remember doing this
also did you try googling the issue‚•πno
my eyes were hurting
and i had a headache‚•πok‚•πso i quit for the day‚•πdo it now then‚•πon that
i cannot
i am using my pc rn
and i dont wanna shut it down
i have school‚•πfine‚•πnext period‚•πi dont really
i have to fix emotes on rails‚•πi see
4H fair app is gonna be fun
we might make it into a website‚•πemotes on rails is a thing‚•πok but that makes 0 difference to me
cuz like‚•πruby
is great
it will
when there is a web site‚•πin what way‚•πso you can like
do things with it‚•πi see
make a login system
with google login‚•πno
you get a jwt
it's like doggo
in how you will log in‚•πno
bad‚•πtoo bad
when you make a website
you make it how you want to‚•πlol
i did‚•πyes‚•πi made it with login
its harder
but its worth it‚•πthe thing is
I want to keep this simple
so‚•πnah
just make ur own‚•πyo akhil
hows ur
arch going
keycloak
myKettl‚•πlogin is not hard‚•πi will make that a thing‚•πyou just need like
hashing
and salt‚•πi will be doing it in a second
i need to like lift and turn it around‚•πi dont deal with the hashing and salt‚•πsso‚•πbcrypt takes care of that‚•πdone‚•πyes
sso is google
or keycloak‚•πsimplicity‚•πor
github‚•πyea like one of those services‚•πi could have used devise
but why‚•πi would use google login‚•πyes‚•πeveryone has google‚•πand you do
what you want
remember
i dont
want
everyone to log in‚•πtrue‚•πonly the people I want to use my service use it
because
they upload files
and I do not want them uploading child pornography to my server‚•πbut i think
a well designed system
can handle that
with public login support‚•πYes
But
I do not want to deal with this
this is invite-only‚•πok‚•πso I will do it like
doggo
the end‚•πyes‚•πwas about to say‚•πi wanna finish codetools this weekend‚•πr u doing it like doggo‚•πbold goal
yes
you get a token
and you sign in
with the token‚•πalso that's insecure‚•πwhy is it insecure‚•πcuz you store a token
in the browser‚•πok and then
xss‚•πyou dont store tokens in a browser
also
tokens and passwords
are bad
google and Microsoft know this
its why 2fa is a thing‚•πi mean cookies‚•πdoggo‚•πdid i say doggo is a good example‚•πok I might add oauth2 support
later‚•πlike with playtools
if you sign in
your password is not stored in the browser‚•πisn't XSS a problem for any website‚•πto keep you logged in‚•πmay i recomend that the tokens be like 256^256‚•πlike‚•πa session is stored in the browser‚•πi could xss you rn
with doggo
and get your token
by using xss from codetools‚•πyes doggo is bad‚•πbecause codetools
has an xss vulnerability‚•πwhich is‚•πwherein
you put
a <script> in the description‚•πtrue
but like
that cant get my doggo token
also‚•πthen how can they get youre emotes token‚•πif someone finds it
or sees it
or has access to your computer
or sees it in a file‚•πisnt that
the case‚•πor sees it in a chat‚•πfor like
a lot of things‚•πyes but‚•πlike i could go in
and reset your playtools password‚•πno
you cannot
you need the password
to reset the password‚•πah‚•πand since the password is not stored in the browser‚•πok‚•πyou cannot see my browser‚•πthen
the token
will not be stored in the browser‚•πbut then how do they stay logged in‚•πsession id‚•πyes
session management
playtools uses sessions
and session ids‚•πill just do something with rails
done
that is how to install emotes‚•πwhy cant you just make like
a shell script
and run it‚•πbecause
that is
painful‚•πlol less painful than learning nix
idk i told my dad ramesh is learning about NixOS
and he told me
why not just use a batch file‚•πyes‚•πIntelliJ is awful
i do not like
intellij
it like
if i open the open file window
it attempts
to download
the entirety
of my OneDrive
to my pc
and if i dont let it
it completely hangs
and dies‚•πGreen‚•πso effectively‚•πi like intellij‚•πi cannot use it
to open anything‚•πoh
i dont use the cloud so that would be why
you can probably disable this behaviour‚•πcy is thinking
about 4H today
he is unsure
a bunch of
higher people
are coming
is coming‚•πakhil have you ever considered joining 4h?
that is scary cy‚•πi have‚•πand then?
why didnt you come‚•πwhy didn't you ? ramesh‚•πidk i was lazy ig‚•πwhy
tf
did I add a sad face‚•πidk ramesh
u do u‚•πyou should join our 4h club‚•πit's like the time i texted some random girl in uwu speak and it sounded really flirtatious but i didnt mean that‚•πwe need more like
good people‚•πlike‚•πjust never do uwu speak‚•πyes‚•πi may try and get my makaws
working
or finish CodeTools
or
worry about 4H‚•πi may try to get libreoffice to not take 10 hours to open
i need
to try bspwm‚•πyup
im going to use bspwm or openbox‚•πi forgot to have setup generate the secret key for rails‚•πlibreoffice
right that's a thing‚•πit is a thing
that is insulting to libreoffice develoeprs‚•π*sigh
my English class‚•πAh I have a health test
i forgot‚•πis discussing
why
chicken
is not
a vegetable‚•πluckily
you're allowed to look up everything
he said so‚•πum‚•πpasta on pizza‚•πum‚•πpizza with no cheese
pizza with no sauce‚•πUMM‚•πfundamentals of debate
i learned that mrs harding eats eggs in the morning
and she puts tomato sauce on them
HAL‚Ñ¢‚•πthat is called a margarita pizza
is gud‚•πi dont like cheese‚•πyes‚•πy‚•πcuz cheezy‚•πcheese is good‚•πyuh\‚•πits like
the 2 things you can make everything out of
milk and petroleum‚•πlol true‚•πmilk good‚•πi dont like milk‚•πcheese good‚•πor petroleum
milk is an acid
did you know
ph of 6.7
you dont notice until you drink like
plant based milks or whatever
that are not acidic‚•πum ofc i dislike gasoline‚•πand then drink regular milk again‚•πhuh‚•πi like the idea of milk
like
a suspension
as a drink‚•πwho likes to drink gasoline?‚•πno like petroleum products
i dont like
how everything
is petroleum‚•πgasoline products are a thing?‚•πnot to eat
just in general
i dont like things
products made
with petroleum‚•πah okay‚•πthe problem with milk is like
its too dynamic
if you get fresh milk
and let it sit
it turns into
different things
each day
its just like
idk
also its an animal product
and i dont like animal products‚•πum what?
vegan?‚•πtransitional-vegan‚•πhuh‚•πso like‚•πidk i can eat anything‚•πi try not to eat meat
but‚•πas long as its not red meat
anything goes
and pork‚•πi think
we should stop
or lessen
meat consumption‚•πi mean
eh‚•πmeat is the #1 cause of deforestation‚•πyea but meat gud‚•πlike i said
lessen‚•πyay
im done with school‚•πeat it sometimes
but
not much
ramesh has no problem with this‚•πlucky‚•πim effectively done with school
we have a work period‚•πi mean for the US its prob not gonna be a problem‚•πand im working (for sure)‚•πbut with other countries it might pose one
yup‚•πthe problem with meat
at a fundamental level
is what we learned in Bio
last year
the energy conservation between trophic levels
the corn required to feed one animal to feed one person
could feed 10 people
so it takes 10x more resources
just in food for the animal
plus all the resources for the animal
like land
and emissions
and water
and energy
then there is the ethics discussion
about keeping animals in the places they are kept
and then
actually
theres the fact that like
those places
can cause pandemics
in fact
the coronavirus pandemic
may have been caused
by meat production
but that is just speculative
we dont really know‚•πi mean
its unlikely‚•πthe thing is
they are really good places for viruses to thrive
and spread
and mutate‚•πhe let us out to do the quiz‚•πi failed my math quiz
i am somewhat sad
but i musnt be
there is no time or energy for sadness
Alex Strasser is making the assumption i made‚•πi also failed my math test‚•πwhich is that
no one has improved
since last time
we met
but my dad corrected me on this
he said
cy
you dont know
maybe they are app experts now
and i am very good now
compared to before
Alex wants to present the existing app
but
i wanna make a new app
with new features
or take the old one and add much fun new features to it
it was made with Ionic
and i actually wanna turn the app into just a website
but
ionic apps
are websites
so that would not be hard
but i wanna add lotsa features‚•πbut meat gud
it taste gud‚•πyes‚•πso im not gonna stop eatin meat
cuz it gud‚•π*sigh
the problem is like
the planet‚•πmars‚•πmars‚•πyes‚•πdid you see
how hard
it was
for them to like‚•πSPACE COWS‚•πland‚•πoh
i dont eat meat‚•πyup‚•πive joined the chat‚•πI am effectively done with skool‚•πi am
done with school‚•πbut u eat animal products right?‚•πhave been done for like 20 minutes now
yeah like eggs
and milk sometimes‚•πi do cp English so it is like much easy‚•πmore eggs than milk though
i do
ap engilsh‚•πramesh doesn't like milk‚•πi do
i like‚•πyou dont like‚•πewwwwwwwww‚•πcow milk‚•πewwwwwwwwww‚•πi like‚•πits ok‚•πdo you want me to make this political rn‚•πes bueno‚•πyes‚•πlol‚•πgo ahead‚•πmichael
what is your party affiliation‚•πlibratarian
or however u spell‚•πthats what libertarians say‚•πyup‚•πah hck‚•πi can do whatever i want and the gov can suck it‚•πso
you can do cocaine
no‚•πpersonally no‚•πyou can traffick children‚•πwell isnt it legal in some states?‚•πand the government
shouldnt‚•πbut idk what other ppl do‚•πintervene?‚•πid
c‚•πyou dont
care
if people
traffic children‚•πi do, that is why we should hav military and border security‚•πbut isnt that
contrary‚•πlibratarians are not agenst it‚•πto intervening govt‚•πintervening govt means that we should not hav gov restricting things like free businuess‚•πso
to you
keynesian economics
is bad‚•πexplain keynesian‚•πkeynesian is basically like
when we go into a recession
the government
should increase GDP
by doing government things
and intervening in the economy‚•πno
gov should not do that
the reason we hav ressissions is bc of gov‚•πah
so
we shouldnt have entered WWII?‚•πwhat no‚•πwe should have entered WWII?
you know‚•πwwii was defending our assets‚•πthat it caused the government
to do
a bunch of spending
which
as a direct result ended the great depression
making jobs, etc‚•πact not a direct result
but, im not agenst wartime spending
and the gov should have done that
it was right‚•πbut thats
contrary‚•πbc wwii was just‚•πto what id think
k also then
should we kill the fed‚•πi gtg cuz in person
end‚•πlolk
this was fun
hi cy‚•πhi ramesh‚•πyou were watching‚•πi launched you into a political discussion with Michael‚•πi think i have some more politicking tools under my belt now‚•πi mean yea
economics is a fun subject
i wanna learn macroecon‚•πyeah
id be down to learn both
which is why im gonna take it next year‚•πi mean same, but i dont see a real benefit for micro
unless ur like accounting/learning game theory as well
game theory plus micro econ would make sense i would think‚•πi bacc
but wifi die soon‚•πooh‚•πhola‚•πcuz i on bus
so i wait till bus leave‚•πah‚•πwamesh u wanna continue discussion‚•πyes
um
i was saying
do you want to abolish the fed‚•πthe fed reserve?
yuh‚•πyes
why‚•πit allows the gvmt to excess spend
like debt‚•πthe
fluctuations between recessions
are exacerbated
without the fed‚•πbut we would not have a ressession in the first place if we dident have the fed‚•πuhm
and then
there was another
so there was a recession in the 1890s
before the fed was made
also the fed helps prevent inflation
without the fed
banks can just do whatever they want without being regulated
which means they can pull money out of thin air‚•πbut the thing is, that ressession was in argentina‚•πlmao‚•πwicth was caused by English trade‚•πthere was a recession in the 1890s
idk‚•πthat was messed up‚•πthe point is that there were recessions before the fed‚•πby gvmt
yuh, but brought on by gvmt
also bus gonna go bye bye soon
so if i go away unexpectantly‚•πhaha‚•πThe lower of fone
Power
Ahhh
This is the effects of the rescission
Not wut caused it‚•πthis is
yeah but im saying
this
is false
because
there were recessions
before the fed‚•πYuh, but caused by gvmt‚•πah
point taken‚•πramesh
do you wanna call‚•πlet me‚•πand help me‚•πsee this
no‚•πwith my mak‚•πLol cy got shut down‚•πif you want help‚•πlol not the first time‚•πyou can do it over text‚•πno i cant
i dont have my computer
its taken‚•πwdym‚•πits hard to text
and it gives me a headache
when i dont have my pc‚•πI just realized I can't eat meat today
Sad‚•πwhy
cant you eat meat today‚•πLent‚•πah yes
that is a thing‚•πI am roman catholic so I do the lent‚•πthat is unfortunate
i dont
want to
also you boldly assume I can actually help you‚•πum‚•πwhen I don't remember how I fixed this issue‚•πcuz you can‚•πI just
google things
a lot‚•πyes but you know what to click
i dont‚•πwhat
do you mean
by click‚•πthe results
you know which ones are relevant‚•πClick the first one‚•πand you understand linux better‚•πyes
why dont you
learn linux‚•πIf that doesnt work click the second one‚•πclick on all of them‚•πYea‚•πsee the thing is‚•πthey tell me to do things‚•πur gonna keep‚•πthat are irreversible‚•πasking me to
help you
forever
if you don't learn how linux works‚•πno, ramesh
i will learn
by doing
and asking‚•πThat's not how I learn fortunately
I learn by reading books on the subject‚•πalso idc much about linux‚•πthen don't use it
buy a mac‚•πits my only option‚•πthen if you want help‚•πfor what i search‚•πyou will text me
since I'm not calling you‚•π*sigh
when you have time
tell me
im not doing this rn
it will happen faster with help‚•πI will never have time‚•πso ill wait‚•πto call you‚•πuntil i have some solution‚•πI always have time
to text you‚•πthe other thing is it gives me a headache
the whole thing‚•πit gives me one too
i spent
an entire day doing this
multiple times
the only other way I know how to do it is to use VMWare
that took like 10 minutes
to gpu passthrough
like not VMWare on linux
VMWare ESXi‚•πOr proxmox‚•πbut then
you need
esxi‚•πesxi‚•πThat takes like 2 minutes‚•πis free‚•πwhat is esxi‚•πyeah also proxmox can do it
it's an OS
proxmos is based on linux and is free
so you can use that if you want
it's not as hard‚•πFor virtualalization stuff‚•πive done it before
on proxmox‚•πYea same‚•πproxmox‚•πU just gotta have the correct settings‚•πtheres a wiki guide on it
also proxmox's OSX vm is a bit more tricky
but theres a guide on that too
i did it before
what song is this
no
hey cy
have you seen the chinese captchas before
this is a dumb error
let me fix it
I love it
"Super-speshul screwdriver"
> insert something about cy's expert screwmanship‚•πlol‚•πhi
lisp is a strange programming language‚•πlol ramesh‚•π[Music]
i cant
stand
coding videos‚•πlol‚•πramesh finds a way
to find problems
with everything you do‚•πyes
that is
correct
tbh I dont mind it that much
i do the same thing
but yes you are doing it in case it was a goal of yours to
try and stop
for whatever reason
frankly we should be targeting a more symbiotic environment
idk‚•πthats a wrong‚•πwe had a productive 4H meeting
likely one of the most productive
I am now leading the app
effectively
we are gonna do fun things
the dots represent support
and mentions
the 2 most mentioned things were
web app
and privacy
a private web app
an oxymoron in 2021 lol‚•πhow does a private web app work‚•π?
lol‚•πlike
how
what do you mean by that‚•πa web app
that
respects‚•πyes but like‚•πuser privacy‚•πdid you know
like
my static site
respects your privacy‚•πhi i made a joke‚•πby not having any stateful components
i need to generate another cloudflare token‚•πalso the privacy concerns were more relating to live cams
at the fair‚•πah
how will it work then‚•πidk we have yet to decide‚•πhow did I do this
now cloudflare wont even load for me‚•π*sigh‚•πI think cloudflare died
nvm
k i updated my api key‚•πi wanna make the 4h app on a jamstack
and not make it an app
it will not be an app
it will be a webpage
web app‚•πyes like yew or react‚•πnot yew
yes react‚•πi said
like either
they are similar‚•πyes
that idea
the framework
we might use ionic again
but idk
people liked the queuing idea‚•πwhat is ionic‚•πa ui toolkit
for building fancy uis
that pretend to be native‚•π*sigh
then dont‚•πwhat
is that error‚•πbasically
you cant
use the cloudflare api
to get a lets encrypt certificate
for a freenom domain‚•πi see
then dont
what i need to figure out is how one web app
that like
is contiguous
can have
multiple pages
or paths
in the browser‚•πreact router
ha
louis rossmann‚•πi saw his commentary on the M1 mac
he said
that
USB-C dongles
brick it
if they are not apple ones‚•πimagine doing hardware design‚•πand
he said that
the SSD is not replaceable,
but
that's not new
what is new
is that
some people
already have
150 TBW
with makaws
and so
their ssds are gonna die
and their machines are gonna become wonky‚•πwdym
what is tbw‚•πTerabytes Written‚•πah yes apple
i mean
cant u like
unsolder it‚•πlol no
cuz
1.
its probably paired
2.
its probably signed
3.
if you try and buy a replacement
apple will cancel you‚•πhow would they sign an ssd‚•πidfk
thats just like
what they specialize in‚•πI mean
U prob can tie it in somehow with the t2 chip‚•πakhil go to bed‚•πtheres no t2 chip‚•πit's past your bedtime
but‚•πTf u mean‚•πyou can jailbreak this‚•πYea‚•πso then how are they gonna stop you cy‚•πAlso this
Um
How‚•πcuz apply dumb‚•πIm assuming this is a different mac
Oh blog post time?‚•πwtf happened
the thor thing is broken
USE SLUGIFY
im using my new emacs config
this is all‚•πDo u use default emacs or doom emacs?‚•πdoom
zen mode
yes I know the font size is huge‚•πAh zen mode
I used to have it‚•πI used to use emacs‚•πI need to learn
How to type
Properly‚•πyes
‚Ä¶
wait
python has data classes
hekcja;lfjkasl;kjd
this is basically what serde does btw‚•πwtf is this
my nextcloud
is giving me
15 mbps
Sorta
But I'm not sure
Because I need virtualization
AppleHV
For the ios simulator
With gpu acceleration
And I heard hackintosh does not support AppleHV‚•πlet me check‚•πThe thing is I haven't directly tried opencore‚•πOk so yeah it wont work‚•πSo my question is what will‚•πWhat are you using appleHv for‚•πCuz I know the ios simulator worked in VMware
Ios simulator‚•πwhich one‚•πWdym‚•πlike how are you running the simulator‚•πThrough Xcode
I could try opencore
How long does it take‚•πwhy do you need applehv for that
I can guide you through it‚•πCuz I think it requires it‚•πit will take a couple of hours to a day
depending on if there is any issue‚•πI see
I don't have any time today
But if you have time tomorrow early afternoon‚•πOk have a list of your hardware ready‚•πOk
Thx for the help‚•πah satisfaction
this is all it has just so that u know
its pretty bare bones‚•πI know
I have used it
In my VMware
But it was so crap that like
That's why I wanna try something else
I need it for testing apps
And websites
Which is what it's designed for‚•πyea its nice for that‚•πSo‚•πi should get back into swift‚•πAlso the Mac is useful to have
No you shouldn't
React native
Flutter‚•πnah
ill try this‚•πYes I prefer it‚•πidk what imma make tho
ill think of something‚•πYou should join 4h
And help us with our app‚•πi mean i may‚•πShould I start any downloads
That might take a while‚•πYeah I‚Äôll create a list they don‚Äôt take long tho‚•πBut it's like 14gb
Or something‚•πLongest is like 10 mins but there is some work before u can do it‚•πOk‚•πWait
I wonder if u can do apple widgets using react
That would be cool‚•πreact native you mean
that's a good question
I mean even if you cant
it just creates an Xcode project for you
so you can just add them there
I need to read 4 pages of this paper
once im done
we can start‚•πOk‚•πit might take me a little while tho
cuz its a boring paper
and I have to annotate it
and identify the effectiveness of its evidence
so id say like 30 mins
or so‚•πCool‚•πhi matt
i am ready‚•πOk give me like 5 mins‚•πok
AMD Ryzen 5 3600
AMD Radeon RX570 (Ellesmere, ASUS RoG branded)
ASUS Prime X470-PRO
32 GB RAM (dual channel, 4 modules, 2 brands)
Intel Wireless-AC 9260 (ASUS branded, appears to be an M.2 on a PCIe converter card, also despite being called AC I belive it supports WiFi 6 AX, also has Bluetooth 5)‚•πplz help‚•πah
just
change line 2 to‚•πoooo
much thanks‚•πdiscrepancy between 1d array and 2d array‚•πI dident see that
yea‚•πheh yeah
ur welcc‚•πYes‚•πdo you still need help?‚•πIf I wanna try catalina
Do I just
Replace‚•πyes‚•πThe dmg
Ok
So I run the python thing
That gets the dmg
In the utilities
I don't have to modify the EFI?‚•πnope‚•πHmm
Ok lemme try‚•πim making things
i really like this sourcehut ui
like it's so clean‚•πwait also matt
so how do I update
after I install
just through macos?‚•πsystem prefrences
update‚•πok so no fancy stuff
just in macos‚•πwait
actually i downloaded the dmg throgh the route to get it for opencore
I chose number 9
once that downloaded I ran the dmg and it went through a couple of cycles of starting and restarting, but then it worked‚•πwait so
first
I run the python
to get catalina‚•πyes‚•πthen
i install
then
i go back to the python?
to get big sur?
so i make a new installer‚•πthen just run it and let it restart a couple of times
no
you just run the dmg‚•πoh run the dmg
ok‚•πim just saying that this specific version worked for me‚•πok
lemme try the catalina
bye‚•πCy where do we submit the recording of the french thing‚•πLol wait is that due‚•πI have no clue‚•πAtm my computer is unavailable
Wait
I actually have a physical mac
The MegaWhack‚•πhuh‚•πIt has 2gb ram‚•πI have a phsyical mac too
let's see how much ram it has‚•πI also have a physical mac too‚•πI have the screen of a broken mac‚•π10240M
10 gigs
i also have a hackintosh
laptop
perhaps I should use opencore with it
and install 10.16‚•πu mean 11?‚•πno
10.16‚•π?‚•π11‚•πbig sur is osx 11‚•πi thought they were the same‚•πlmao‚•πi will intentionally call it 10.16‚•πi mean yea u might as well‚•πi still call macos osx sometimes
so‚•πits weird why they called it 11‚•πyeah it's still unix‚•πMacos might be booting‚•πmac os 9
is like
not mach based
so
not xnu based
not nextstep based
so‚•πwindows 10 11.2.2‚•πthis is my actual desktop‚•πNice‚•π*cough
the biggest one is xcode‚•πI don't think wifi works tho‚•πoo does it work‚•πwifi never works
now try your ios emulator
if you want usb wifi‚•πIt worked in big sur‚•πi can send you one
like
a link to one that works
since I have one that works‚•πI have several‚•πand it also does very well
well try them all
mine is like tiny‚•πI'm eating dinner‚•πit's also faster than the internal wifi in that hp laptop
lol‚•πImma try thing later‚•πk
bye‚•πBye
hi I have the Big Sur installer
it didn't ask me to "update"
it asked me to "install"
so im installing
I hope that's right‚•πyeah you install it
thats right‚•πscreenshot on macOS?
how do I take a screenshot‚•πCommand shift 3‚•πbye‚•πyeah thats right‚•πwhy is the quailty so bad‚•πMac
Sc always look garbage‚•πHA
so I was right when I told ethan
that mac screenshots are unreadable
of course, I don't talk to ethan anymore but that's a different story‚•πWell idrk
When i send them in tg
They look absolutely awful
When i check some of the files they also look kinda bad‚•πCy did it work?‚•πIt's not done
Also funny
In the verbose
One of the things was‚•πdid it restart a couple of times‚•πIt's on the 3rd I think‚•πthats when it worked for me
its name changed from installation to macos right?
thats what mine looked like
so you are on the right track‚•πI think it's almost done
Also this time it booted into macos not installer
Ok it rebooted one more time‚•πit should work after that‚•πYea thats good
Ur gonna have macos soon
Welcome‚•πYes I will have macos
In 7 mins‚•πTake the time thing with a grain of salt‚•πIt's been pretty reliable for the most part‚•πSometimes mine says 10 minutes and takes an hour‚•πIt did break once
And told me 67 days left
Then said 4 seconds left
Then climbed back to 67 days
Then reset back to 4 seconds‚•πLess time then it will take for graphics cards to go back in stock‚•πOh mines said a year once‚•πLol
I saw this ipad once
And it was old
And it's internal clock died
And I turned it on
And it said
Ipad is disabled
Try again in
27,469,553 days‚•π*cough
ah
i saw someone do that with an ipod
at a science fair
i forget what they were doing‚•πActually first it wouldn't turn on at all
Then we put it in a freezer
For 30 mins
Then it did that‚•πum what
very cool‚•πMaus‚•πooo
i just remembered
i need to do udemy courses now
ugh‚•πBye‚•πadios
also lemme know how big sur is
i may update
idk yet im still debating on it‚•πI like big sur
My wifi works in big sur
It didn't in catalina‚•πremember that i have an actual mac so everything pretty much works
also if i do install big sur imma do a fresh install‚•πPOG u in?‚•πImma play with macos bye
Yes
Thx for the help btw‚•πhave fun‚•πnp good luck‚•πalso windows is command‚•πYes‚•πalt will be options‚•πThat will be fun to deal with‚•πctrl is ctrl‚•πtest if facetime works‚•πYeah imessage and facetime
Lemme do some testing
Bye‚•πthey should work
cya‚•πJust gonna leave this here‚•πakhil
what's ur apple id
I wanna test imessage‚•πPorqua?
Um just use my phone number‚•πok what is that‚•πAlso set up like airmessage or whatever its called
Allows u to get imessages on ur phone
install xcode‚•πI message works‚•πand homebrew‚•πalso I should install telegram
cuz the web client‚•πand cocoapods if u want‚•πis
awful‚•πuh sure
u can either use the app store or get it off of homebrew
i mean first u prob should do this
then this
then this‚•πim doing xcode rn
so i can test ios‚•πits like 20 gb so have fun‚•πi also wanna install edge
im not on optimum here‚•πwell its not the speed
it downloads fast
its just a large app‚•πits like half done‚•πuh just get the dmg from microsoft
or homebrew it
um
how much do u have in it‚•πClearly much more than 768gb‚•πobviasdkjaopsly‚•πalso my mx master 3 wont work
the bluetooth tried to connect
but just starts looping‚•πu need the options right‚•πand the usb never worked
since i bought the thing‚•πum what
how
actually its a pretty cheap one i think‚•πhow do i make the usb work‚•πits like logitech universal one‚•πor the bluetooth‚•πok
press button once
then hold button once
to repair a computer on a different profile‚•πUSB mapping in the post install guide
That might help‚•πno the ports work
the reciever doesnt‚•πOh‚•πuse bluetooth
switch to a different ‚Äúprofile‚Äù
then re-pair‚•πtf
i have airpods now?‚•πu have airpods?
nice‚•πi dont tho
apple's taunting me‚•πLmao‚•πconnect to them
then play loud music
see where it comes from‚•πlol‚•πwatch if its like ur galaxy buds‚•πit wont connect to them
or the mouse
cmon even linix connected to the mouse‚•πare u in like fancy blinking mode on the mouse?
if not then idk check like bluetooth in system info to see if things are working‚•πno so i put it in pairing mode
it connects
then
it disconnects
then it connects
then it disconnects‚•πah
this
um install the logitech options software
thats what fixed it for me‚•πyeah doing that now‚•πthats what used to happen when i first got the mouse
cause of some apple gatekeeper restriction
also u should prob loosen the restrictions
so that u can download actual stuff‚•πidk its been working fine
i installed edge
and options‚•πoh then its prob fine‚•πwait can you hear me‚•πno‚•πi switched the mic‚•πDSiAble
imagine spelling‚•πi got the mx master working
by installing the software
to put the unifying reciever in pairing mode‚•πu dont‚•πidk it worked this time so‚•πalso cy
please
for the love of god
auto hide the dock and menu bar‚•πi like them
i like the icons
they look nice‚•πreally?
i hate them
a lot‚•πthey follow the right trend‚•πnah it's good that you like them
exactly‚•πalthough microsoft did a better job i think‚•πidk
wait till you see the app indicators‚•πwdym‚•πlike
when you get a notification
it has that red 1 on it‚•πyes‚•πwhich is really useful‚•πand?‚•πthose r nice‚•πwindows has those
i hope you are aware‚•πyea but the mac one is flat‚•πalso
the tray‚•πwhich is nice‚•πis not awful
since it's at the top and the icons are very nicely arranged‚•πidk i still prefer windows‚•πoh yea set up hot corners‚•πmacos is too
logical
its not
ergonomic‚•πwait till you add keyboard shortcuts‚•πthis‚•πand then
close chrome.
and then watch how long it takes to open‚•πwdym‚•πit doesn't close per se
it shows that it's running
but when you click open‚•πnothing closes per se‚•πit opens instantly
unless you cmdq then it does close‚•πyeah i dont like how things dont close‚•πyou can cmdq if you want it to close‚•πyou have to right click
and force them too‚•πmuch eaiser than alt f4‚•πits convenient‚•πmore ergonomic‚•πi can accidentally close like a billion tabs and reopen them‚•πi have my ifone simulator‚•πgood
now also id try like
and some nice mac apps are around‚•πi dont wanna use mac apps‚•πthere‚•πthat i dont have to‚•πthis one
also homebrew is really nice
try installing your dev env in macos‚•πrn i have a problem‚•πyoull see how easy it is‚•πwhich is that
i need the USB installer
to boot macos i think
lemme test
imma leave
bye‚•πdid you not install opencore on your disk
bye‚•πno i dont think so
how do i install opencore to my disk‚•πidk‚•πoh cy btw‚•πwhat‚•πso on mac here is a word of advice
.txt files dont exist‚•πlol‚•πtake it as u will‚•πi need to figure out how to install opencore
so i dont need my installer usb in order to boot
opencore is just the EFI right?
so i just copy the EFI to the ssd‚•πum i mean
dont u just need to like add it to grub
yes ask him‚•πif i try and boot the ssd directly
it just
boots linix
not macos
im not dual booting tho
its an external ssd‚•πdo you still need help‚•πyes but not now
I mean
how do I install opencore
but I cant do it now‚•πyou create a partition on your disk about 200mb formatted to exfat and call it efi. place your efi in it‚•πthat's it?‚•πyeah its really easy
the guide makes it seem impossible
it takes a really roundabout way of doing it‚•πok thx
I gtg
bye‚•πTypical washington post article:
I go to a random programming Discord server
There is a books channel.‚•πlol‚•πI am like "hmm"‚•πis there also an almondmilk channel‚•πI wonder if someone has talked about the Stormlight Archive here
And any of Brandon Sanderson's books
And the latest message
Is literally
"I've read a lot of Sanderson's books"
And like
Before that
"I recommend the Mistborn series"
This is very funny‚•πyes
cy wants to stream video data to an ESP‚•πNo
Do it
Over RDP‚•πlol
cy is happy with his mac install
except because he is cy
he must complain about the antialiasing
not being up to his standards
cy also likes that in 2 mins he can get VMware player to boot a physical drive
in windows
not the mac tho
that one wont work‚•πWhat about
Parallels‚•πthat's for mac
why do you keep telling me to use it
also it doesn't work
cuz appleHV‚•π"VMware 10 and Parallels 13.1.0 do support their own hypervisor, however using such outdated VM software poses a large security threat" From the guide so it is possible but may not be the best option‚•πthis was a separate comment
not macos related
I just figured out that VMware player can just boot up any external drive
in windows‚•πYea its a cool feature‚•πso it means I can boot up my linix ssd
without
like
shutting down windows
i copied the EFI over
and it works now‚•πCool
In the post install guide you can make the boot up look pretty and also get rid of verbose mode
For the verbose just get rid of the -v argument in boot args in your plist‚•πok

this is like
percy shelley-level radicalism 

this was radical in the 1790s and it's still radical today
because
they were talking about abolishing marriage
and just saying "let's have polygamous relationships"
and tbh it might happen‚•πYay‚•πif you just used osx
this wouldnt be a problem cy
because web devs
test stuff on mac os
Emacs as an IDE‚•πit looks nice
ive been trying to get vim to kinda do that
but then i realise thats a stupid idea so i may just switch to emacs‚•πlaunchnix will be having static IP support before the end of the day‚•πFancy‚•πvery‚•πwhat is launchnix‚•πa thing
that lets you define a file

you use bleach
and then

then there is no xss
because i cannot script you‚•πwdym right‚•πeg
i cant

more and more purple
and pink
and green‚•πUm‚•πcygh‚•πand rainbows‚•πjust
upgrade it
iphone 12 is out‚•πOr trade it in if it will get u any moneys‚•πits quite funny because that ipod touch is so thin
that like
if the battery swells
it bends the screen
a lot
like
if you press on the screen
you get a ripple in the LCD
in the shape of an iPod battery‚•πyeah get an ipod touch
no
iphone 12
sorry
cy
how many wifi issues have you had with your samsung‚•πlike 1
recently
and not many more
well other than the fact that like
i have a conspiracy that like
AT&T
are like
messing with my auto switching cellular settings
to make my dad pay more moneys‚•πUm
Dont get AT&T then‚•πlol‚•πGet unlocked‚•πtell my parents that‚•πThis‚•πi made a bad decision
ok
ok its fine‚•πThis‚•πits
‚Ä¶ fine
*sad‚•πGlobal phones are good‚•πi would have gotten the unlocked
its a long story
and it gives me a headache
and makes me sad
so we will not discuss‚•πEspecially when providers add like malware in ur phones
When it boots up‚•πmine is mostly fine
i just get software updates like a month late
and dont get betas
and i wont be able to rom flash later‚•πU should
I regret my decisions
Cause i cant jailbreak now
Its not the worst but it‚Äôs annoying as heck‚•πi want a pixel‚•πPickles are good‚•πthey are
i like pickles‚•πno
get an iphone
pixels suck
their hardware is awful‚•πtheir hardware is good
google and apple manage to make good hardware
samsung is ok
but the software tho
on google
is just
better
than on samsung
samsung is a hot pile of tar
literally
it gets
hot
i dont like any phones‚•πapple
does not‚•πhave USB-C‚•πalso apple's jailbreak ecosystem is better
the UI is better
imessage is undeniably better‚•πimessage is for ignorant americans‚•πwell‚•πiGnorant‚•πgood luck trying to‚•πYes‚•πcommunicate with anyone
congratulations, you have just blocked the entire gender of "female" as ignorant‚•πIts more like community‚•πcy thats misogynistic
you cant say that
librals are going to cancel you now‚•πliberals are going to cancel me‚•πyes
because you are anti apple
and thus
anti women‚•π*sigh‚•πyou are calling women
ignorant‚•πiGnorant‚•πfor choosing imessage
no ignorant
which is MISOGYNISTIC AND SEXIST GET CANCELLED
CANCEL HIM‚•πthis works
unfortunately‚•πtbh‚•π<code> doesnt‚•πi am getting angry‚•πat what‚•πthe world‚•πlol
i need to figure out how to enable <code>‚•πwhat is wrong with this conclusion‚•πramesh
its not just women‚•πit's mostly women
although yes it is men it's also more women than men
switch this‚•πno that's not what i want‚•πand you would probably get
the imessage one
yes
also
this
this just confuses me
is this telling me
that women are not interested in sexual relationships?
like‚•πgee thanks
thats useful‚•πyeah it is
the ereader one‚•πlol‚•πis interesting
when they talked about men being raped they were saying that "oh men don't mind getting raped by women since they're always lustful for sex" but like if women are also like human by nature then why aren't they too "lustful for sex"
yeah
what did I say
ur not helping ur case cy
more women than men use ios‚•πlol
does that mean more women are liberals than men‚•πidk
but that's not important in this context I think
i think more women are liberals than men though
my data points:
women that decide that it's a good idea to put their "pronoun" or whatever
yes
that seems to align well with this
i also agree with the republicans on the surveillance stuff
many of them feel like big tech is spying and whatnot‚•πmy dad is a centrist
but there is no place for such people in the US
you either vote democrat
or republican‚•πor you vote
centrist
like that third party with like
3 people‚•πCOVID cases found in New Zealand: 63‚•πim still‚•πpeople found in New Zealand: 143‚•πlol
this
do women not have sexuality or something‚•πill let you ponder that
whilst i work on codetools‚•πI mean
it makes me wonder stuff
‚Ä¶
github doesn't minify their stuff
nvm
not ALL of it

wait
the blur thing
it's not great but it works

it uses‚•πand why dont the border radii work‚•πwebkit‚•πopen it in firefox
and be amazed
at how it fails
to work‚•πwelll
it used to work‚•πi added js for reliable hashes
so the hash does good stuff
rather than work sometimes

is that firefox decides not to work

IE and Samsung Internet are having the same issues
imma for the first time actually try and make my layout work in IE‚•πWhy?‚•πthen maybe itll work in samsung internet‚•πNot many people use internet explorer anymore‚•πyeah but you see

...‚•πFine then u can
I dislike IE alot‚•πi thought samsung internet

you know if one browser changed itself to work like another
it would not cause a problem
cuz web designers are forced to make things work in all browsers
so websites would still work‚•πwhat if
web browsers weren't so complex
or
no
or we stopped using websites
let's make another compiled cross-platform gui standard that doesn't require a renderer like this
that would like have the same problems
lol
there are frameworks that will automatically fix this stuff I think

is good‚•πyes
but then
I proceed
to be inconsistent
since im too lazy to figure out scss imports‚•πits just
bad
its not
good‚•πI think it is good
because
of how little effort seems like it was put in‚•πnah you could put in a little more thought
and the same effort
and get a much nicer result‚•πidk
do you think
rameshCSS is viable‚•πwdym‚•πlike
i could make a library
called ramesh.css
like water.css but ramesh.css
do you get it‚•πidk frankly for what i do
i just need something that like
makes the body have 0px margin
deals with collapsing margins
makes the background black‚•πi have‚•πand makes the text‚•πreset.css
and then I override everything else manually‚•πinter or DM
and then makes the text white
and adds hoverfancy
and rounded buttons
and stuff
so i have basicstyle.css‚•πI have some scss files
scss is wonderful‚•πyou have to compile it tho
and i dont wanna
compile
my css‚•πwebpack‚•πi could write some
for other things
meh‚•πthe nesting
is what gets me
plus the comments
now less bad‚•πi see
i wanna make a blog‚•πyou can add all these optimizations‚•πwith Gastsby
or whatever
one of those fancy ones‚•πonce you get your basic styling‚•πbut with SEO‚•πJekyll?‚•πhugo is another one‚•πbut like
if i
make a new page
and just
Gatsby build
then push to github
i build
i push
netlify just updates‚•πnetlify is what I use too‚•πso i dont need any of that xtra fancy stuff‚•πnokogiri keeps having random segmentation faults‚•πi could use a CMS
but i want that SEO
and HTML
that is good‚•πI use my own ssg
but you all know that
ive said this like 200 times‚•πyes
you have
ideally you see i want a system
that like
does all this more autonomously‚•πHow long did it take?‚•πsee you could use like
an object storage thing
no
idk i can try gatsby
for a blog
or something
idk how to do all of it tho‚•πum
i think a day
but i spent a few hours one night writing the markup language
dont write a markup language‚•πlol‚•πIdk i would stick with markdown
If i were to make a blog
But i dont have plans for it‚•πi want a system
where
i can focus
on the appearance and the content
not on the system
i need to look into this more
in fact i now know what i want
a blog that's partially static, and partially dynamic
like
the homepage
would be dynamic
to allow for fancy infinite scrolling
and whatever
but
the actual posts
would be
static
for SEO and speed and consistency‚•πi wrote somethingl ike this
where it had authentication behind a static site
what do you think
that's stupid

hi my name is
OVH cloud
and my data center burned down‚•πI was talking about this with JP yesterday‚•πlol
whats the deal then
do ppl like
just lose all their data‚•πno they had backups I think
so SBG or whatever is back up‚•πall their recent data‚•πno I think even that‚•πhow is that backed up tho
th is this
it just like
"added" me
im reporting spam‚•πnice one
i got like a 79‚•πI have not gotten a C on a science test ever
not as far as i can remember‚•πneither have I
but ive had a couple this year so‚•πthis is unheard of‚•πeh
my grade is always fine
they never do much‚•πi am emailing him
the technical failures of the test were not taken into account‚•πum‚•πyes i spent time reading my notes‚•πwhat failures?‚•πbut i also spent time
decoding latex
on every
other
question‚•πthat was only one question i think?
everything else was fine‚•πi had many
from what i remember‚•πhuh
i mean decoding latex wasnt that hard‚•πok but it takes time
and its very error prone‚•πwell u can ask him ig
i dont think they will do anything about it‚•πit needs to be brought up
this is not acceptable.‚•πi mean our teacher brought it up, but he said things happened‚•πdr p did not mention once today
when talking about that test
the technical issues‚•πMe when I fail a calc test instead of getting the standard A+
"ok"‚•πae pea sem in are‚•πHow is it?‚•πis good
is scary
but
is good
these are the most complicated

dammit wtf is a "simple sequence"

ways to decrease signups
make it almost impossible to actually create a password‚•πramesh is trying out email in emacs‚•πcy has a fancy blog project in mind
the problem is he doesn't feel like writing anything
so hes unsure whether to persue it‚•πwhite is black

I am not going to click on it
Until telegram loads some preview up‚•πlol
i wanna know the right kind of database
for each application
and how to use them
also i wanna see if i can replace mongodb in codetools for the code
to something else
that would hopefully eliminate the need for a 1000 character limit
or whatever
so like
code is stored in a cheaper way
that is not mongodb‚•πMake ur own‚•πthen theres graph databases
a;sdlkfj;alskdjf too many databases‚•πLaunchnix should have feature parity now‚•πthis is why i hate sass already
i get some code from github
for a Gatsby site
and the whole thing works
except
now
it can fail to compile
which it does
and renders my site inoperable
it just adds more points of complexity and failure‚•πdo you want to write the same kode 40 times‚•πAh wait‚•πevil mode
the other way around
also for the love of god dont use emacs keybinds
unless you like
actively want rsi‚•πI wont
This is looks pretty good
Ill try it over the weekend‚•πyou should install emacs‚•πHmm
I may
Gui emacs‚•πgccemacs
is like
fast‚•πok so some malicious activity
somehow Unigram has downloaded like
large
quantities
of
age inappropriate content
to my computer
it must have auto downloaded from one of those spam invites
idk‚•πremember
yes the spam invite
cant you like
prevent people from putting you in rooms‚•πmeh it doesn't happen often enough to be a problem
im just minorly concerned that like‚•πillegal
content‚•πsomeone is gonna see this stuff‚•πwill end up on your computer‚•πi should delete it‚•πyes
you should‚•πbut it would delete my cache‚•πYes‚•πof other stuff‚•πno just
delete it
it doesn't matter‚•πok‚•πit's not worth the risk‚•πThis‚•πim done with my work‚•πAlso isnt there a setting‚•πwhat shall i work on‚•πTo stop telegram auto downloading stuff‚•πhere‚•πTf is this
Looks like a scene from an indian movie ngl‚•πtelegram
piracy is a thing‚•πok i deleted all that
then i realized
after it was all gone
that i forgot to hit shift+delete‚•πrecycling bin‚•πso i pressed ctrl+z‚•πJust empty the trash‚•πand it all came back‚•πlol‚•πthen i did shift+delete
does linix or mac have undo in the file manager‚•πYea‚•πlol npm is having a fun time‚•πI can just mass exodus my trash bin‚•πthen i realized
this is just the videos folder
theres also a photos folder
i did not look in there
i do not want to see‚•πJust delete the folder itself‚•πalso its like
thousands of files‚•πWell have fun‚•πim not deleting them
they are fine‚•πUm no‚•πoo npm is done‚•πIts better to just delete them‚•πplease
yes
delete them
also read white is black‚•πthat took so long i finished a whole homework assignment and forgot what i was even doing
npm in wsl
is slow
as
hell‚•πboot into macos
and watch
how it is actually usable
unlike windows garbage‚•πrn its just broken‚•πcy
just
please
just
try macos
just try it please‚•πthat takes effort‚•πit's unix‚•πalso it wont work‚•πit will not have these problems
why‚•πI mean its not much effort‚•πi thought you spent a day‚•πan afternoon‚•πMultiple afternoons‚•πjust try
booting into macos
and doing this
just
try it‚•πmacos is really annoying
it clears my nvram‚•πjust try it
yeah other than that‚•πand then i cant use windows hibernate
it just kills windows nvram‚•πlook
try using npm specifically‚•πthe same thing is happening on wsl and windows
its telling me‚•πjust try macos
it wont have fs issues‚•πits not an fs issue‚•πChange its perms‚•πalso it will be faster‚•πi can switch back to windows now
i know this is not a windows issue‚•πtry macos for web dev
npm i
also it will stop complaining about fseventsd
since thats mac only
since all web devs use mac‚•πmac bad
mac proprietary
and the most‚•πno
XNU is open source‚•πun-open‚•πit is actually open
the API is open‚•πit takes‚•πit's more open than windows at least‚•πan afternoon
to install‚•πyou think‚•πits not to be relied on‚•πwindows would be easy‚•πunder any circumstances‚•πif it were just for
surfaces‚•πi can actually install windows
and rely on the fact
that it will be there
when i need it‚•π*cough‚•πmacos to me is some experimental toy
its cool and fun‚•πIdk bout u but macos has been pretty reliable‚•πbut
not good
its not dependable
i cannot trust it will be there
if somehow my support stops working
or something goes wrong
i musnt lose my ability to develop
windows and linix will always be there‚•πlinux is junk
I think you have said something like this before
use macos‚•πi dont have to worry about dictator apple
telling me‚•πapple is good‚•πim not worthy‚•πlinux is bad‚•πthen use macos‚•πyou havent experienced
the‚•πyou can go do that‚•πno
i dont practice what I preach‚•πlol hypocrite
you see with me
its about long term
ok it works today‚•πhuh‚•πbut that means nothing for something like this
it always needs to work
also the antialiasing in macos‚•πthere i fixed it
more proof‚•πgives me a headache‚•πI hate the cupertino font‚•πik its a movie quote
wdym?‚•πmacos has terrible antialiasing‚•πit's also awful in linux‚•πit makes my eyes hurt‚•πif you somehow
enable segoe UI
as your main font
dont install segoe UI on lunix
it ends badly‚•πwindows is good in many ways‚•πu have to play with ur fontconfig to replace Segoe UI‚•πlike antialiasing‚•πi mean u can turn off some of the annoying stuff‚•πlook
i never said I liked macos‚•πfont smoothing is not bueno on some monitors‚•πwindows "just works" when it comes to monitors
and fonts
and antialiasing
like
you dont appreciate it
until‚•πlinux is‚•πyou try something else‚•πmac does as well‚•πalso a
"it just works"‚•πits something universal‚•πjust dont use awesomewm
use like GNOME
with GNOME literally everything works‚•πalthough i have to say‚•πit's basically the de facto linux DE at this point‚•πon linux it works too
its just mac
that doesn't work‚•πyes
because it's a hackintosh‚•πno that's not why‚•πwhy am I even defending this‚•πim surprised to see this as well‚•πi know what is "because its a hackintosh"‚•πur holding it wrong
dont use a surface on linux
and then yell at linux for it not working‚•πlol that's old
i have used linux much more
since then
on other devices
and for other purposes
that was just a fun project
that failed‚•πi usually get the feeling that cy really dislikes linux
like desktop linux
im not saying‚•πno he doesn't‚•πserver linux
or wsl‚•πdesktop linux is fine
but
it doesn't suit my needs‚•πwindows is adware
macos is kiddie icons‚•πlol you call it adware cuz like‚•πlinux is good‚•πthey install
candy crush‚•πyes
adware‚•πi fckin hate those icons
that was annoying‚•πi like the icons‚•πthat meme is good
the‚•πi never open the start menu
so i never see them‚•πone with the5 year old on macos‚•πik they look like absolute garbage‚•πJetbrains mono is growing on me‚•πthe icons on macos are really nice
i like them
also certain things are nicer
but
like‚•πthey are unnecesary‚•πmaximize minimize
is like
not really a thing
l/r snapping‚•π?‚•πlike
on windows
i can run the window into the left of the screen‚•πyeah
win left‚•πyea
i do it as well‚•πand it snaps to half the screen‚•πhow else do i do apush notes‚•πwin left win right is a thing on kde too
no
but you have to use a mouse
on macos‚•πoh and then they have the windows key‚•πand you have to hold a traffic light
the command key‚•πas the control key
which is called
command
and has a symbol‚•πi mean its not the worst‚•πthat is impossible to remember‚•πno
it's slow
not hard to remember‚•πalso its less ergonomic‚•πu never use the control or option keys thats just what it is
that is true‚•πalso on my hackintosh
scrolling is
broken‚•πapple hates scroll bars‚•πthere were other things
like
the dock
is nice
until
you want to maximize
then its really ugly
or its hidden
neither of which is optimal
and then there are 2 bars
one on the bottom‚•π?‚•πand one on the top
and the one on the top is bad
cuz like
if i have 2 screens
this happened yesterday
and the app on the left screen is focused
then the top bar
will have the options
for that window
on both screens
so then i go to the other screen
and i forget
that that window is in focus
and not the one on the right screen
and i do options
on the left window‚•πwhat?‚•πthe bar on the top
with edit
and window
and go
and apple
and whatever
on dual screens
it breaks
cuz
i have 2 windows in my focus
but one of them takes the controls
on both screens
also apps cant span 2 screens‚•πI like jetbrains mono
did I say this‚•πon windows i can put an app between 2 screens‚•πthat is like
the one good macos feature
unity had it too‚•πwhat‚•πi never clicked on the second monitor‚•πidk for me that didn't work
also i dont like how i cant put a window between screens
like i can on windows‚•πwhy would u want to is the question?‚•πi want this
because
if i have 2 full screen windows
and 1 other window
and i dont want to lose it behind the others
i can put it between screens
then click to the first screen
click back to the window when im done‚•πbetween monitors‚•πthen click back to the other fullscreen window
or
sometiems
certain content doesn't matter
or can be cut off
then i can more efficiently use space
on my screens‚•πkotlin‚•πI just click my mouse and all my screens show up‚•πshould I make my font this big
i feel like im old if I do this‚•πMake it resonable‚•πalso cy did you ever implement WSJrunner5‚•πthat's a goal of mine
panos i want my rounded corners
panos im waiting for my rounded corners‚•πim getting those tomorrow
switching to awesomewm‚•πplaytools‚•πplaytools
i just said
lol
you should advertise your product rn‚•πno ive wasted enough time already
where do babies come from?‚•πSo
essentially‚•πi will spare you‚•πall these babies live in an alternate universe‚•πit was a question‚•πand what happens is‚•πon the playposit
ms tan will answer it
dont worry‚•πah okay‚•πcy likes coffee
it tastes good‚•πi thought cy wasnt allowed to coffee‚•πno they said when i turn 16 i can drink coffee
i am 16
you can take them home‚•πyes‚•πyes‚•πi have
453 ducks‚•πi have 457 ducks‚•πit's 3
right‚•πi think its 3
but ive seen different numbers
some have like 200‚•πit's 458
cy was closer‚•πnah find the original meme‚•πi cant find it
i dont think he originally said it‚•πhe didnt
but the meme was on reddit‚•πJamstack‚•πi dislike jam
nutella is nicer‚•πtrue
the web for frontend developers
that wanna call themselves
"full stack"‚•πi mean
that just means u do both
yes‚•πshu√≠‚•πfront and backend‚•πI really need to push my dots‚•πyeah but with jamstack there is very little backend
its all high level stuff
usually
i need to code along with her here
bye‚•πor‚•πwhat is the direct translation of you're welcome
in spanish
in French its
"of nothing"‚•πah so similar to the english ‚Äúits nothing‚Äù
another way of saying ur welcome‚•πyeah
dont girl‚•πsmh‚•πHey its a wild cy‚•πi have to email mr. whalin about a random form
this feels uncomfortable
does cy have any ideas‚•πum
what random form‚•πNHS forms‚•π?‚•πit's due at 2:25
idk if they will be fast enough
but theres a chance
national honors society‚•πDo it‚•πim trying‚•πCause‚•πim trying‚•πwhat do you have to tell him‚•πto sign the NHS form‚•πi dont exactly know what nhs is
but‚•πit's like a form
and it asks
about other activities you have done
and it wants a signature‚•πok one moment‚•πill write an honest email‚•πYes‚•πHi Mr. Whalin,
I haven't seen you in a long time.
How's it going?‚•πI talked to him in the summer once
he wanted help with his Ubuntu computer‚•πFor the National Honors Society, I have to say all the things I did outside of school.
So, since I participated in the iPad Club, I would like you to sign this form to say that i participated.
I hope you and Bert are doing well
and staying safe from the coronavirus
Thanks a lot,
Ramesh
‚úîemail written‚•πWho is Mr. Whalin?‚•πthe volunteering guy
he was pretty interesting‚•πAh i see‚•πApparently Samsung is promising better android updates than google
3 generations‚•πUm‚•πon S, Z, Note, A, and M phones‚•πThats kinda short
Wait no
Thats longer‚•πit's due at 2:25‚•πand 4 generations of security patches‚•πdo you think he will respond before 2:25‚•πMy j3 has no support after 4 months‚•πidk‚•πProbably
Mabye
Send with like an urgent tag or something‚•πno this is starting recently
j3 is like
old
and its a J‚•πIk im saying
3 generations is long for a samsung i think‚•πyes
the thing is tho‚•πIts still nothing compared to ios tho‚•πandroid updates are not like
ios updates
the system apps are updated separately
most of them
and especially with google mainline
where
core components of android‚•πIos does this i think
Some apps are‚•πare not actually part of android anymore
they are managed by Google Play Services
so they can be updated
without consent
or input
from the manufacturer
or carrier‚•πthats problematic‚•πno it means
longer support
and faster updates
also like
old android versions are not that bad
like
i have a galaxy s4
with android 5
but like
most things just work
perfectly fine
and all the google apps are all up to date‚•πHi Mr. and Mrs. Whalin,

I haven't talked all of you in a long time, and perhaps I should be better about that‚ÄîI hope you are all doing okay. I know our pandemic has been tough on everyone, but I hope it is getting better. I still remember our volunteering experiences and I hope with our vaccines supply increasing that one day in the near future we will be able to come back to the Fellowship Village. I do miss coming on Saturdays. I know that I definitely will return if I'm still in school when everything gets better.

To my main subject, my school‚Äîfor the National Honors Society‚Äîis once again asking for my experiences outside of school, and they want more signatures. Unfortunately, I think this is due at 2:25 PM today, so it would be greatly helpful if you could sign this attached document (it also asks for the number of hours I volunteered, and my estimate may not be perfectly accurate, but I don't think it's an overestimate). However, if signing this form is not possible, that is totally, completely, and perfectly okay‚Äîthe National Honors Society forms aren't mandatory at all, and I should have most definitely started working on these things this earlier, so it's really my fault for not e-mailing you earlier.

Again, I hope you all are doing okay. Stay safe. If you need help with your computers, you can still ask me (:

Thanks a lot,
Ramesh‚•πThat‚Äôs nice‚•πI think this is okay‚•πYes
Very good‚•πtotally, completely, and perfectly okay‚Äîthe National Honors Society forms aren't mandatory at all
i would like
make this more concise
thats totally fine‚Äîthe National Honors Society forms aren't mandatory at all‚•πI am once again
asking for your financial support‚•πlol‚•πMemes are great‚•πI sent it
Forgetting to ask for the phone number‚•πIdk it isnt concise but it does convey how its not important
Nice one‚•πit's fine
I think I have it‚•πWell we shall see if u get them in time‚•πI gave him a few hours
like 4
so I think I can get this‚•πProbably‚•πresume‚•πDepends if he checks his email‚•πcuz they want that
does Mr. Whalin check his email
I think he checks it‚•πlisten from 3:30
i like that part‚•πCy do you think I volunteered for 60 hours‚•πprobably
i mean
52 weeks in a year
2 hours per week‚•πnot all weeks tho‚•πbefore koronavirus‚•πi skip some‚•πif you were doing it for 2 years
that would be
208 hours
max
so a little less
like 60% of that
so 124h‚•πTbh I probably
underestimated like crazy‚•πdont underestimate yourself‚•πI remember them saying that I could make up my volunteering hours and they would still sign it because of the amount of help I gave them
idk if he was joking
or not‚•πlol‚•πI mean tbh
they probably would've‚•πlol‚•πthey did seem pretty thankful to have me there‚•πthey were‚•πlike
i am
going to go back there
when everything opens again
at the end of 2021‚•πI see
i wanna index the internet‚•πLike google?‚•πwe already talked about this‚•πDid we?‚•πlol yes
but if you forgot
yes‚•πI forget everything after like 3 months‚•πlike google‚•πtwitter‚•πi need an efficient, multithreaded system
oatmilk
almondmilk
yes
oatmilk is a bit weird
its like
milk with pulp
like theres orange juice with pulp
oatmilk is milk with pulp
what if i used redis
for speeeeed
the thing is I need a tree‚•πi recommend bonsai‚•πi need something fast‚•πaspens grow pretty fast ive heard‚•πi mean i could use bamboo
its not much of a tree tho‚•πu could
yea‚•πhmm
a relational search index
hmm
so wait
so
if i had a key-list pair‚•πdidnt u make like a python thing do this‚•πi did but
um‚•πand u scraped like twitter‚•πwell the thing is
i need an actual db
so i dont index each thing 5 times
then ideally
i can get something with enough performance
that like
i can run it at 1gbps
i could run it on the 4h server
see all i want rn
is a list of URLs
then i can add indexable data to them later‚•πlike google hmm
see how like bing and google do their stuff‚•πwell google also has a cache of the content
that it can index
but i dont have enough space for that rn
also i can do that easily later
see ideally i have some database
that lets this work well
the problem with redis
is its RAM
so no
no not that‚•πdownload some ram‚•πthat would take up bandwidth
from my indexer‚•πahh true
idk‚•πso the question is‚•πi need to create a financial network
which is gonna kill me‚•πwhat db is fast
i need to store‚•πidk sqlite?‚•πthis
i need to store
key: url, list of keys
but i need it searchable by url
so i can search does this url exist
no this wont work
i need to do url:list pairs
i could use Mongo
but no
probably not
the thing about mongo tho
is like
its just a JSON
cyrch‚•πpostgresql?‚•πidk‚•πshould I update my omega installation‚•πyes‚•πidk‚•πbut it will
delete my history‚•πlol mine ran out of charge
and it like
erased its history‚•πum i think mine kept its history if i did it from source‚•πwebUSB
webSocket
webRTC
webAssembly‚•πcy
can you find mr whalin's phone number
i think i have it
but I want to make sure‚•πum‚•πlike check your call logs or something‚•πok
i mean
tell me the number
i can search by it‚•πok
um‚•πno actually
i dont
have any thing
idk where the history is
actually‚•πok
so do you think it is this‚•πtext it
only one way to find out‚•πidiot‚•πyes‚•πok‚•πah i should self host bitwarden‚•πbitwarden_rs
also I need to add this feature for static IPs in launchnix
to choose ur interface‚•πplease yes
also imma get back into setting up kubernetes‚•πfix your‚•πi wont stop till it works this time
which it will‚•πyou should try nixos‚•πi could
nixos was really easy to set up bridges and stuff‚•πyeah im going to let you choose a static ip on ur bridge
v
look at my cool status‚•πvery cool status
should i do my thing in r or c?‚•πwhat thing‚•πa ripoff bloomberg terminal‚•πum
idk what that is
c is more useful
to know
i think‚•πthis thing
cause i dont feel like spending
24000 a year‚•πi use templating in a text file
since im ramesh‚•πi tested mongodb
it inserted documents at
4.5k documents per second
i doubt my indexer will need more than that
now time to relate all these documents to each other
imma make 100k doucments
and then
make them all related
so then it has to trace through them‚•πI added custom static IP interface support
that was very easy‚•πim doing 100k search read relations
so it searches by id
then finds the relationship
then searches that
then finds that relationship
then keeps searching
i think tho
im in an infinite loop‚•πI added custom interface support for launchnix‚•πNice
Nice
Making a stock market api is a lot harder than i thought‚•πLinux Is Not UniX‚•πits Mrs Harding‚•πAm I basically a TA for APCS
is this
does this qualify‚•πno it doesn't qualify
you spend all the time like
discussing APUSH
with Aryan‚•πLmao seriously‚•πalso TAs do like
grading
and stuff
and follow teacher orders‚•πI agree
but sometimes‚•πmy mom has TAs
that grade things
for her‚•πexactly
the problem
is that no one needs help‚•πSo your mom has a lot of power then‚•πand then sometimes they need help‚•πno not really‚•πLike what super Mario bros was coded with‚•πlmao
no like the other day
people were asking me questions about their airplane lab‚•πthey could also ask me questions‚•πthey could‚•πwould that make me a TA‚•πbut
you are taking the class
am I "taking" the class‚•πtrue‚•πSo Ramesh is like a partial TA‚•πso what do I put on this junk NHS resume‚•π20% TA‚•πLmao
humour‚•πYes I agree‚•πWell
TA is like an actual job‚•π20% TA‚•πAh didnt see that‚•πWell then he is like a partial slave‚•πhes not a slave tho
cuz he can just
leave‚•πi can‚•πor discuss‚•πHe is technically doing work but not getting paired‚•πAPUSH‚•πlook
i tried to leave
if you didnt notice
i just left in the middle of their apush conversation
and no one wanted help so I just came back‚•πIsnt that what interns are?‚•πno‚•πYes but some of them get paid‚•πramesh
is
neither an intern
nor a
TA‚•πwhat is cool about it
Then use ohm's law to find the vdrop over the wire
Then the tab auto closes‚•π20% slave
What?‚•πlol double e
ee‚•πidk i think its just
im thinking out loud
so akhil doesn't know it
i have 2 more classes to do for school
No yea you have to pay and use a Mac for anything related to iOS development
My dad said we can take them
cinnamon spice black
well after i enabled integrated graphics in the bios
and embedded systems
batter life
and now
you see i dont like milk
idk
also I found why my printer leaks

4H‚•πTru‚•πand i plan on doing something for my mom
also
i will have lots of testimonials
from all the people
including Akash
at some point
akash told me he would give my testimonial after i helped him
with web dev‚•πI did
When was this
When did I sign the contract‚•πidk‚•πyes‚•πI require proof of signature‚•πbut u did at some point‚•πWhat‚•πbut did he sign on it?‚•πi need to identify
how to‚•πYea I prob did‚•πuse mongodb‚•πY‚•πso i can index the internet‚•πAgain? Why?‚•πum
i wanna
index
the innernet‚•πBut
Why‚•πhow should i know‚•πAre u making a search engine or soemthibg‚•πyeah
i can make a search engine
but its more about the data
i want the data‚•πYep this is just a classic Cy moment‚•πi had to like
 run ethernet through the walls
 to get to the furnace room
 but like coincidentally
 the router is right on the other side of the wall
 and coincidentally
 there is a hole
 in the wall
 just big enough for 2 ethernet cables
 so i ran
 the 2 ethernet cables
 and now
 it is on ethernet‚•πWhich is better to learn for applications, C# or C++‚•πc# for unity and windows
C++ for everything else‚•πTime to learn c++‚•πhave fun
printf("%d", 3)
malloc
&var
i like some of the things you can do in c
types are not really a thing
so like
a character
is an int
is an array
is whatever
like literally
you can like
declare variables
by like
telling the computer
to allocate memory
and it allocates memory
then returns a pointer
so if i want a char array for example
i could say
for an array of 10 chars‚•πIdk i need some way to make desktop applications‚•πno
not this
not c
use some cross platform thing
dare i say electron‚•πMabye
I might do rust and elm
I need to first get le data‚•πi dont need to make desktop apps
i make websites
they do all
no prob
and they are cross platform by design
best cad for linux:
onshape
since it actually runs
cuz its web‚•πIdk i think having a ticker app is better if its a app then a website‚•πwhat is a ticker‚•πStock market tickers
Like symbols, charts graphs reports
All them stuff‚•πi see‚•πEarnings‚•πPWAs are a thing‚•πThey are‚•πi see decreasing need for desktop apps
from a development standpoint
i like them but like
web is just
so much easier
to deal with
the other thing is like
good luck with display scaling
about 50% of windows apps
fail to scale properly
to hi res screens
and they are slow
and buggy
and they often take up extra resources
that a browser has already allocated‚•πwell fck it
mabye ill try next.js‚•πwhy not gatsby‚•πi dont think this is gonna be a static website
because it would always be changing
by the minute‚•πbut i think Gatsby and next.js serve the same purpose
to build static sites
for jamstack
they are not "static"
they are just
client side rendered‚•πdoesnt next has server side rendering‚•πit might
idk‚•πgatsby is client, next is server‚•πdont listen to me
do something‚•πYeaaaa
Their pumpin it again‚•πit's going up again i think‚•πI can invest in it cuz I won't b able to short sell ot
It‚•πAgain?
Really‚•πYup‚•πDamn‚•πgo look on yahoo finance
I made bloomberg terminal
this is one monitor‚•π*claps‚•πno no no
michael do you take italian
michaels gone‚•πThat was a fricken spike
Is blue price, and the bar graphs volume?‚•πmaybe
wait
im trying to find my awesomewm complain post‚•πhi my name is cy
and i managed to generate
a python error
so long
it was longer
than the history
of the terminal
so i cant see what started it‚•πrewrite your program in rust‚•πcyrch single threaded gets 80 records per second‚•πbspwm‚•πnow time for the fun stuff
multithreading‚•πWait cy
U have a thing that like downloads every page it sees
And download links as well right?‚•πall links
50 threads is a bit much tho‚•πHave u tried doing the world bank website?‚•πthat said it was doing like thousands and thousands
um
i can try with that as the entry point
if you want‚•πSure
I may download a lot i think‚•πi mean it doesn't download everything
it downloads only html documents
nothing else‚•πAh then its useless‚•πwait why
what do you want‚•πI wanted to see if it would download all the data sets‚•πit doesn't download anything
it only stores links‚•πakhil‚•πi mean it does download things
but it doesn't store them‚•πyou can use vim keybindings to switch windows in bsp
MOD + hjkl‚•πIm
Downloading it‚•πI mean awesome does too
but awesome is SO overcomplicated‚•πNope bspwm
\ hjkl would be so nice‚•πguess i cant use ly‚•π?‚•πgimme an entry point‚•πUm how bout the world bank‚•πlink‚•πOr nasdaq exchange‚•πlink‚•πhow about
hmm‚•πthats a redirect
it needs to return 200
doing this
imma time it and see how many links it can identify in 30 seconds‚•πÊàëÊòØ‰∏Ä‰∏™‰∫∫
ignore
ls
lol‚•π30 seconds‚•πNice
Thats alot isnt it?‚•πthis is different from before
in that
it identifies and stores
everything it finds
but
it does not know what is in everything
so last time i could run like 500 threads
searching the internet
this time i can only run like 3 or 4‚•πHuh‚•πbecause mongodb
takes cpu
but I still get more results
cuz im actually storing them
as opposed to only storing them when they are being searched
also i presume mongodb is giving me uniqueness
i am upserting‚•πOwo nowo
Roman numerals
Are great
Ok this may be weird‚•πi do not like it‚•πBut how much are abacuses
I had one
I want to use it again
It was so fun for quick calculations‚•π‚Ä¶
ooh
polybar auto reloads
btw
bspwm comes with gaps ootb‚•πalright so we are having some duplication issues
lol its because i left the test code in
time to scrap this and start over
lol
i was wondering
how things happened
so fast
i learned something today
this is what mongoDBCompass does when it cant find duplicates:
so now i have a nice, unique list
thanks to having fixed my code‚•πI can't
adjust my volume
*yet cough
I have to add the pulseaudio module‚•πlol linix‚•πit's bspwm
not linux
in this case
>‚•πi need to ban all links containing &amp
they break everything
things are getting interesting
WE WILL KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE IN THE US
AT EVERY POINT IN HISTORY‚•πjapanese‚•πits like
idk where
it finds that
actually
i can find out
i think‚•πÔÄó
ÔÄó
ÔÄó
ok
HA fas works
Óßß
does that show up for you‚•πno
this shows up on android
this doesn't show up anywhere
for me‚•πNada‚•πim getting a
thing
called font awesome to work
in my bar‚•πok so this is cool right
so
i was like
where tf did this come from
and i now know the relations
after having done lots of testing
so
if you dont have it enabled
which the crawler doesn't obviously
at the bottom
there is a link for Kyo Nagashima
which has a link to the amazon site to purchase that book‚•πThat
Yes the internet is all connected‚•πits quite fun to do
and it just like
downloads the internet
and finds sites that match a string
then you do this several times
and you end up with the result
gimme a list of URLs and i can scan them
no a list
imma get the entirety of the mongodb into a list
and then try some searches‚•πcy can you send me a test discord message
nvm
i have an alt
im mad
i literally
had the perfect wallpaper
on unsplash
and then I tried clicking on it and i clicked the wrong button
and now I can't find it anymore‚•πsad‚•πfor future reference‚•πi like to make my own wallpapers‚•πi did
but I don't want to use those‚•πcy wallpaper‚•πim going to try the chinese website‚•πmake that your wallpaper
i might make it mine‚•πthis is mine
but i have three monitors
so i have to make three choices
I have two of the three
ok im satisfied‚•πmy old house
sad
i preferred it‚•πah
where did you get the "sad" part
like just
sad
...
sad‚•πim sad‚•π"sad"
as a one word response‚•πi like my old neighborhood better
it looked much nicer
imo
that said i would have like to live in one of the houses on James's steet
those were really nice
not the ones on his side
the  ones on the opposite side‚•πAh
I do not know where you are talking about‚•πthe ones on the ridge‚•πidk
i need google maps or something
lets post this image to a random discord server‚•πgoogle maps
but i drove by that street yesterday
on the way back from the dentist
a lot of the houses were renovated‚•πThat's interesting
that house also looks like james's house
also
I shall sleep now
gn‚•πJames's house
hes on the not ridge side of sunset ridge
cys house
circa 2013‚•πis there an inter monospace
that doesnt have the serifs of a monospace font‚•πI dont think so
also cyrch now has an ultrafast mode
in which
it is getting
about 1.2k url identifications per second
like you run it for a couple minutes and you get hundreds of thousands of results
it slows down but it starts really fast‚•πhi im pinging my refridgerator
ok the devs aren't that incompetent‚•πWE ARE INDEXING
AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED
green means good
cyan means returned something other than 200, but still will process
blue means mime type was either not present or not text/html, and url was skipped‚•πwait
once you index
what are you going to do with the data‚•πthat's a good question
idk
im running in unsafe mode rn‚•πlike windows unsafe mode‚•πno
my program
is running in the mode‚•πoh
unsafe mode
is not a thing
it is called‚•πwhere the entire search index has to be in memory‚•πregular windows
idk where that came from lol‚•πso it just like‚•πhow much ram are you using rn‚•πfills up the memory
lemme see
its doing like 2-3k urls per second
it has several modes this program
it has full featured mode
which takes hours to do what fast mode does in minutes
but in regular mode
the index is not stored in memory
it stores content type and status code for each url
and it takes popularity measurements
and you can run as many instances of it as you want
you can disable the logging of ct and sc for higher speed
then
there is memcache mode
where each instance of the program stores the known index in memory
and does not send upsert requests to mongodb if it sees the url in its cache‚•πI see‚•πthis however, disables popularity measurements‚•πno
I C‚•πthen‚•πwhat if you write this in C
would it be faster‚•πtheres unsafe mode
unsafe mode
replaces upserts
with inserts
which increases speed
but causes minimal duplication
and you can only run one instance at a time
then theres fast mode
which is just
ct/sc logging off
memcache on
unsafe mode on
then you choose how many threads you want
this is running at 100 threads rn
in normal mode if you do more than 7 threads
your mouse stops moving
probably not‚•πso how many requests per second?‚•πright now?‚•πyes‚•πlemme see
its doing like 60-70 rps
although its highly variable‚•πhmm ok
what if‚•πbut like 2-3k identifications per second‚•πyou made a search engine out of this‚•πI intend to‚•πCyearch‚•πcyrch‚•πNo I think Cyearch looks typographically superior
And the logo
should be‚•πyes
coming out of the search bar‚•πlike just use various cy images
like the loading screen‚•πmy ban list isnt working tho‚•πshould have this one‚•πso its like
indexing bing search
and wikipedia
albeit quite fast
but still‚•πWait‚•πyes
i know what you are thinking
cuz that doesn't really work
that well‚•πCause u need a search term?‚•πwhats fun tho is i also have an ancestry generator
which like
figures out where a result came from
lemme run it one moment‚•πOh nice
I wanna start working with mongo‚•πmongo is nice cuz its simple
also i fixed my bing and Wikipedia issues
i um
forgot to trim the whitespace
off my test conditions
so they were always false
but now that is fixed
so the results are much more interesting‚•πAh man
I hate when things are false‚•πlol
verbose mode is fun to watch
though a bit dizzying‚•πIts the stupidest state
Ah this?
U sent it before‚•πyes that video‚•πi really need to implement the stop event for playerctl‚•πThats ur bar thing right?‚•πyuh
did cy see it
it shows the currently playing song at the top
this‚•πi see
windows volume control has this‚•πyes
but i get to write a python script
to do it
which is funner‚•πcy likes his search indexer
although
now that its not just firing at bing
at max speed
its a bit slower
bing is really fast
like
exceptionally fast‚•πIt is
But i prefer the results from google
It usually has better results than bing‚•πyeah
should i run a superspeed mode one on another site‚•πyes
it has lots of links
it will lead
to twitter‚•πyes but somehow that's like
not showing up much
hold on lemme do something then ill start that
and slowing down the system‚•πLol
did it get to the binary cache yet
since it has a repository‚•πit does not download anything that is not text/html‚•πnixos
has a
search feature
on its website
with like thousands of packages
that will link to a huge github repo‚•πimma ban /nixpkgs/‚•πdrun‚•πhi my name is cyrch
im doing 10k identifications per second
cyrch works distributed as well
you just need a mongodb server
and they will all report to it
so you can distribute your index
i presume its much faster tho if the mongodb is running on the same system‚•πthis is what im doing rn
yo akhil if you go to school i can give you the airport brick‚•πIf i go back to school‚•πdoes this mean ramesh wants to go back to school‚•πim already in the process of convincing my parents
aka
im going to make them sign up‚•πCause u got‚•πtell me if you are able to‚•πi have a few days‚•πi dont think children will get the vaccine for a while‚•πi might
i qualify
but theres not enough stock‚•πi mean unless you have preexisting health conditions‚•πI do
like
very mild asthma‚•πidk my brother has asthma‚•πi have asthma
it used to be worse
aka‚•πmy mom isnt even vaccinated yet‚•πit's not very bad‚•πshes like
a teacher‚•π0.5/4 of my family is vaccinated‚•πi see‚•πdoes she go to rutgers‚•πyes‚•πah
that is strange‚•πnot that often tho
she like
has to go sometimes
her colleague got it
even tho she never goes in
or so i hear
idk
also‚•πUr thing links similar things together right?‚•πWindows Terminal is GPU accelerated
like Alacritty
or whatever its called
no
its in superspeed mode rn
so it just like
generates a list
and that's it‚•πAh
Cause if it linked similar things together it would be intresting to see like a visual model of the data‚•πwell
it has a 'from' tag
which means
you can form a path
that it took
to get to a link
its not fun tho cuz i made mistakes
also it like
which is like
everything‚•πU should index‚•πsometimes it does
my main issue is like
it gets stuck
on one site
so like
every
single
piece
file
page
for their linear algebra library
which is like thousands
and thousands
of urls‚•πOh god‚•πand then
it will do this
for every language
they have
on the page
which takes like
hours
that said
reallly fast
so it didn't take a terribly long time
hi im android
you can
plug in an arduino
and i will talk to it
and give you a serial terminal‚•πhi
im ios
if you plug in a non apple dongle‚•πeyeohesse‚•πi will brick your phone
thats like
false
maybe
but
i needed to make a point‚•πno there are no dongles
cuz there is no USB
host‚•πhi im ios
what is an arduino‚•πhi im ios
you didn't plug anything in‚•πhi im ios
ur holding ur usb port wrong
aka
you cant plug that in‚•πhi im ios
what is usb
liteneng

hi im cy
i didnt read ramesh's story‚•πlol‚•πdid you already sign up for in person‚•πno
not yet‚•πah
im going to talk to my parents tomorrow
imo the benefits outweigh the risks for me‚•πim almost certainly going in person‚•πi hate
online learning
with a passion‚•πidk‚•πi just hate it
i cant do it‚•πwait do we have lunch periods together
or is that akhil
that's akhil‚•πwhat period
does akhil have lunch‚•π8‚•πi have
a free peroid
8‚•πhmm‚•πis akhil going to school again‚•πno‚•πwhat about
words‚•πwords?‚•πalso
convincing people to go in person in droves
might be bad‚•πi suppose
just let ppl do what they want‚•πYeah
like my friend is telling me how he signed up to go in person
and like this affects my decision
but
i already wanted to go to school in person
also
do you take the bus‚•πprobably not at that point in the year‚•πah‚•πthis is all the 4.3 million things‚•πim probably going to walk home‚•πi have found‚•π1 gigabyte
in a bit
im probably going to walk home
since i can
walk home‚•πwe should like‚•πalso akhil i see you online go to bed it's past your bedtime‚•πwalk for exercise‚•πjk‚•πNope‚•πexactly
5
?‚•πno like
before‚•πyes‚•πYes‚•πin 8th grade
we did this every day‚•πno not that before
like
before
4th mp
like‚•πTf u talkin bout‚•πin the afternoon‚•πidk
what you mean
before‚•πmy dad wants me to
and im like
bored‚•πim going to walk home
since i dont‚•πno like
in mp3‚•πdo anything productive immediately after school‚•πlike rn
in the afternoon‚•πoh you mean like‚•πyes‚•πthe thing where you are like
hey ramesh‚•πyes‚•πwant to go for a walk
no‚•πm hm‚•πill go for a walk with you
from school‚•πok‚•πalso i think my other friends
might walk home with me
so i might alternate‚•πi mean
the direction
is like
similar right‚•πmeh‚•πif you are still walking home‚•πmezclando mis amigos no siempre funciona‚•πMust be nice‚•πcyfinfaza: mixing my friends doesn't always work‚•πTo be able to walk home‚•πi basically walked home
all the days of mp4
in 8th grade
so i think I can do it again‚•πi walked home
all the Thursdays and fridays
of mp1 and mp2
this year‚•πah
also advisory is going to be annoying
having to sit there when i could just walk home early‚•πlol yes its not like at home
where u have big pc‚•πit's fine
i need to buy a battery for my laptop tho
the hp one‚•πyou will have to move from 3 monitors to half a monitor‚•πthat dell one is so junk im not going to
use it‚•πthe xps?‚•πyes
i hate it‚•πwhats wrong with it‚•πthe camera‚•πum‚•πalso it's too small‚•πi have my lenovo‚•πalso watch as btsd_guest bans my mac address‚•πthe gpu fails‚•πIs it the one on the bottom?‚•πyes‚•πSpoof it‚•πtahts what i do
i open my laptop in 9th grade
and
it no work‚•πi can connect to BTSD‚•πSame‚•πapparently
they blocked discord‚•πor BTSD_GUEST
but‚•πso i think wireguard
to gcp
is in order‚•πno they didnt‚•πthats what my friend said‚•πthey probably block that tho‚•πnah
ill just
change the port‚•πlol‚•πalso i doubt
the sysadmis know what wireguard is
hmm‚•πik they block OpenVPN UDP 1194‚•πakhil are you thinking nixos rice for the hp laptop?
for when i go to school
nixos is fairly reliable once you get a stable config‚•πYes‚•πlol tried to open the 1.5 gb json file
in vscode‚•πIts not a bad idea‚•πoom
out of memory
lemme try it in emacs‚•πIts just very annoying‚•πi know nix
so‚•πFrom what o have seen anyway
Yea so it may be nicer‚•πi have quite a bit of experience with it
so it might not be so hard‚•πI say go ahead‚•πalso i can run zoom on linux
since i can just tell the teachers
to readd me
when it kicks me out
also i hate emailing teachers
im deleting this part
im going to add a new scene instead
so instead of just saying it
i will
exemplify his insanity‚•πShow it‚•πill be like
wait i gotta collect my thoughts
basically hes going to fail something in school
and then
he will expect julia to like
ask him whats wrong
and when nothing happens
he'll get really depressed‚•πYes‚•πand then it goes away when he forgets about it‚•πBueno‚•πat the cousins' house
like
like what happens at the end
not as bad‚•πYes‚•πbut like hes going to think that way
and like maybe do a little bit of it
im being vague here since cy might be reading
and i dont wanna spoil‚•πYea‚•πbut it's a good plan i think‚•πWell go ahead and write the scene‚•πhave any additional suggestions?‚•πYea‚•πeither that or im going to sleep‚•πUm as i remember not really
The rest of the story is fine‚•πmhm
i think i might add in  a thing
explicitly saying how he feels better
soemtime during the cousins' house scenes‚•πAdd that part and I‚Äôll read it again and provide thoughts‚•πfun
aight imma do that
i might intentionally write it really badly though
since according to brandon sanderson
that's a good writing technique
then you improve that scene‚•πReally?
Well idk i dont write often‚•πyeah
you should get into it
it's really fun‚•πright fixed that
cyrch was being a memory hog‚•πhonestly I think that tempering your expectations for anything is a good idea
it especially applies when you have high expectations
this is just this general life fact that I am also beginning to realize
also this has nothing to do with school
i am still going to school
just like i have realized this
like how our narrator of white is black realizes things‚•πi see
i have similar thoughts
but they are a bit different
dont spend much time on things you want to be happy about
because
if you spend too much time on them
and they turn out to fail
you will be very sad‚•πtrue
I think I also have something like this
Like
In the middle of february I basically set myself to be like
The reason I can keep doing things and be happy is that im almost there to go to school
like
going to shcool will apparently
save me
idk why‚•πlol no dont think that‚•πyea
i‚•πthat's a path to‚•πam aware
of this‚•πbad‚•πi know
i am not
i dont think that anymore
but if you put all your expectations in something
and then it doesn't work
then you get sad
but I think I might add something‚•πkeep you eggs in different baskets‚•πyou can put all your expectations in something
but also keep in mind that you like
it might not end well
and be very aware of that
so when you actually have your expectations fail
it will not be do disappointing‚•πi say "oh its just some fun thing, it doesn't matter"‚•πso put everything in one basket and then expect it‚•πif it fails
whatever‚•πto destroy itself‚•πif it succeeds
we forget what i said‚•πand if it does then whatever
exactly
I'm not so good at shrugging things off
if things fail‚•πme neither
unless like
its just
"some fun"‚•πYeah but what if nothing is just
"some fun"
I mean i classify my programming projects as
"some fun"
since I don't really care if they fail‚•πcy has to do like
the entire oral history project‚•πEvanston‚•πtonight‚•πOh dear
okay
have fun
*fun
*cough‚•πthen he has to do an AP Seminar EOC-Style Written Argument Analysis‚Ñ¢
kolidge bored‚•πdo you really not support CJK‚•π?‚•πchinese
oesnt
work‚•πoh‚•πin inter‚•πsend me a Chinese character
or two‚•πÈõ∂‚•πk thx‚•πÂ§©
wonderful!
idk how to fix that‚•πgoogle fonts has a "language" picker
so you can pick a language‚•πi could use
source han sans‚•πyes‚•πlike my favourite font
but inter just
looks good here
that's good
but
just the introduction
now it shows up
but i dont like
it doesnt look good here‚•πlol so that's why you need a china font‚•πyes‚•πi think SegoeUI
has like
Chinese characters‚•πi need to figure out a fallback
for inter
and then it will work‚•πtry Segoe‚•πI uninstalled Segoe
it screws up my font configuration
on linux
i think
it installs the windows xp version of segoe
so it is not antialiased or whatever‚•πMicrosoft YaHei‚•πig this is fine‚•πdont send really long screenshots‚•πyou can click on it‚•πyes but its annoying‚•πalso i cant really
show this
without a long screenshot‚•πyou can make it taller
then it would be less long
relatively speaking‚•πah
okay then I will do that next time‚•πok thx‚•πi need a better cjk font
i mean my system ui font is source han sans‚•πCyrch now has a Cross-Domain Only mode
which makes for fun results
cuz it ignores all links‚•πwhat does it do
oh‚•πthat link to the same host‚•πinteresting
how big is the dataset rn‚•πi have many datasets
the one im doing rn
is
oh also it now has a timeout‚•πno like
the size
in gigabytes
interesting
cyearch‚•πwait
thats
outdated
^^ not outdated‚•πstill not big‚•πYea i expected gb
Also i may go to skool mp4‚•πoo‚•πsee i told you
you didnt tell cy before‚•πDid i not?
I swear i sent this before‚•πthis is the first i hear‚•πtold you
you must have like
forgotten to press send‚•πWell there u go
I may just he stupid‚•πok so i can be less worried
to tell my mom
to put me in school‚•πwdym less worried‚•πi mean shes gonna anyway
so like‚•πyou should be more worried
also whens the deadline again
myp arents havent put it in yet and i dont want them to forget‚•πidk like
soon‚•πFriday i think‚•πalso imma work at the pool
in the summer
maybe‚•πah
if I get vaccinated‚•πNice‚•πim going to make a system
bettter
telegram bots‚•πIm trying to get internships‚•πdiscord bots‚•πidk what they want‚•πmultithreaded requests
distributed pings
huge numbers of providers
and by the time i am done
we will have mass vaccination‚•πshould i rewrite cyrch in rust‚•πso there will be no point
if you want to spend a few months learning rust sure
but yes‚•πtbh it would probably take me a day or two‚•πsince that is a meme
do you know
what
ownership is‚•πmore or less‚•πhow about
the difference between &str and String‚•πyes‚•πsince i dont really but i kinda know
im too lazy
i know what it is
what is &str‚•πa pointer/reference‚•πno it is a slice
which is
a pointer
basically
but rust does its own thing‚•πi mean the thing is like‚•πlol so it is a pointer basically‚•πpython is not htat bad
with memory management‚•πyeah
rust might be a bit faster though
idk how fast so you would have to write it and try‚•πits an easy project to try and rewrite
the thing is like
in order to exceed the speed
the multithreading has to be good‚•πyes
the multithreading is good
very good
ive worked with it before
it's really well designed‚•πmy problem rn is that like
it slows down
idk why
then
it stops.‚•πidk why‚•πthen‚•πtry writing something simple‚•πit goes reallly fast‚•πi have to do my homework now‚•πbye
me too
thanks for refocusing me
bye
just wanted to ask everyone
who would be interested in working on a hardware project
if there was one to work on‚•πIf it were my hardware project and you were all working with me
Then i would be‚•πIt would be cool‚•πAs in
My idea‚•πHuh
so not if it were mine‚•πOr akhil's‚•πinteresting
what if it was shared tho‚•πI have had lots of experience with projects
It is never truly shared‚•πi see‚•πAnd trying to share
Does not work well
Since there is no one to direct stuff
Although that
May be false
I'm pretty sure shared things are possible but i still‚•πyou know from my experience working in teams‚•πNah its true in many things‚•π^‚•πthere are 2 positions
people like to snap to
im the leader
and its your job
and they take one of these 2 sides
but sometimes
people can switch sides
in fact this is what happened at drama club
i took charge of the lights
but then i released charge of the lights
to my partner
and we worked covalently‚•πI dont‚•πwe shared charge‚•πWanna see that word‚•πhybridization
b o n d i n g‚•πSTOP NO OH GOD
I still dont even get sp3 hybridization‚•πya take the orbitals
and ya smush em‚•πWell yea no duh
Idk the hybridizations are weird‚•πmy dad's smart indian friend who lives in california
was talking about cubesats
hes really excited about them‚•πAh those
We had this discussion
When i wanted to launch a satellite to space‚•πyes
well he was saying theres this professor
who is doing a summer program on cubesats
or something
where like
the group will try and build a cubesat
and if they can build something relevant
and get the neccesary funding
they will actually send it into space
and that smart indian friend‚•πThats cool‚•πwho i will now refer to as Partha‚•πIts sad it only lasts for like 15-20 years‚•πlol 15-20 years‚•πBut thats enough if ur doing
Research
Or anything of the sort‚•πsee partha wanted to work on them
he said he would work on software
idk
its a bit too
distant
from me
literally and figuratively
but its a really cool project
so i just wanted to let ppl know
since he likes rokkits‚•πrokkits are cool‚•πyou gotta put 2 k's
or else its rowe kits
cy is trying to rewrite cyrch in Rust‚•πI hav been summend‚•πyes u have‚•πthis project‚•πAbout wut‚•πscroll to here‚•πI'm in
Cubesats
Ooooo
I freaking love cubesats
I hav a gud ieda for a pulpulsion system‚•πi can forward you the email‚•πYuhhh
I would luv to do that
Cuz like
I was too young for the airforce reacherch lab thing‚•πThis‚•πAnd haven't heard back with the other reacherch thing I applied to‚•πNASA internships are like 16+‚•πI did‚•πnice‚•πI would never get in‚•πi mean
there is a chance‚•πI apploed
Applied‚•πi sent it to michael‚•πOooooo‚•πalso i will put the message here‚•πI definitely wanna do this
Cy u gonna do this‚•πits still in discussion
but if lotsa ppl wanna do it
i wanna do it‚•πMy dog is attacking me I gtf
Gtg‚•πbye i gtg too
to go to history tutorial‚•πWoR is words of radiance
a book‚•πWhich is good btw
The interludes are intresting as heck‚•πread
issac finished
the entire series
while you are stuck on the second book‚•πimma try windows on raspberry pi with dual displays‚•πI havent read in a while
I am now‚•πtraitor‚•πSo i will finish it‚•πi hate the english book im reading
i have to read it
since i signed up to read it
i just
hate it
who
wtf
this person keeps giving me awards
just for literally no reason
on this one post
ok is greyed out
ruby
my parents think I should wear a face shield to school
or if not
i need to get glasses
because I can get covid through my eyes‚•πUm‚•πno
it is a thing
i looked it up
but like
it's not the most common way to get covid
but you are protected
since you have glasses‚•πIdk if u want just wear like sunglasses‚•πapparently glasses dont even go a good job
hell no‚•πYea no‚•πbut to my parents
it is enough
tbh im not even sure why i need to wear glasses but if that's what they want I'll do it
any updates on your end akhil‚•πNope‚•πregarding going to school
rip
it's due on friday
so make sure you figure it out before then‚•πYup‚•π"In sweden, it is forbidden by law to be a criminal"
BAM.‚•πSafest place ever
No crime‚•πTrue
i need to fix my pi
aka
it needs ethernet‚•πHow u doing it?‚•πi really wanna write something in C‚•πhi im working on my pc through a raspberry pi over RDP
WoR
its a project
to install windows on raspberry pi
program an stm32‚•πI do not want
to do microcontrollers‚•πwhy‚•πthis is like asking me
why
i like blue
more than green
it's just like
a current personal preference‚•πok
i copied rust code from the internet
then
it said error‚•πi was thinking of making the vaccine thing in C‚•πthen i waited an hour
and now
it says not error‚•πwhats the rust code for
also you can just ask me
i will probably tell you how to fix it‚•πi think the issue is the vscode language server
starts to die‚•πah
just‚•πwhen i run cyrch
no the vscode language features for rust
are like
really nice‚•πyes
rls
is the lsp server for rust‚•πthe same thing happens for python now‚•πok then idk‚•πsee my hope is
if i write cyrch in Rust‚•πdid you install the discord rpc for vscode
continue‚•πsee what happens with python right now
is that
the memory fills up
then empties
then fills up
then empties
also the multithreading is bad‚•πyes‚•πso the hope is that the whole ownership thing will deal with the memory issues‚•πrust has VERY good threading support‚•πand the multithreading will be less problematic‚•πyes‚•πhowever
does rust have‚•πrust also has async if you want that‚•πsets‚•πhashmaps?‚•πa set‚•πwhat is a set
isn't it like
a random‚•πlike a list
but each item is unique‚•πstd::collections is your friend‚•πi see
also i could consider writing cyrch in nodejs
since its faster than python
and also has better threading‚•πidk
i hate js
but that is a me thing‚•πi wanna try rust tho
now if you'll excuse me
i have to go
bye‚•πbye
GLib is very interesting
the spanish teacher has mastered the art of clickbait‚•πhey ppl
its 4pm‚•πHi
It is 4:01 PM‚•πcherry is sad
its too late
i hate daylight savings time
it is awful
in all respects‚•πit will get better
also
ive stayed up
to daylight savings time
every year
in march
for the past three years
so this will now be a tradition
mines different
i gotta do physics
bye‚•πbye‚•π3153
USPS might be able to get mail to me like 

253-07920-3153
That would be extremely cool
if we all just got a 9 digit number as our house ID
so you dont remember addresses
you just
253-079203153
ooh
fun‚•πwait
actually
the short plus codes require a city name
if there is no city
like in the middle of the North Atlantic Ocean
you get something like‚•πDoes anyone want to do a hackathon with me
Like as a group‚•πi said i was interested
so like
if we can get a group‚•πYea that would be good‚•πis this online‚•πYea like all of the hackathon are online‚•πYeah ok no
I'm
allergic to online hackathons
But‚•πLmao‚•πbut if stuff
If we all get vaccinated and this is during the summer or something and things are normal again
then yes‚•πOk notes
Noted*‚•πYep
lokk and feel
i honest
want to downloadly this
um
what tf am i downloading‚•πits ok i can download it for you‚•πim scared this is going to have
like
child no no content‚•πand have Windows Defender scan it‚•πLol
I mean give it a whirl‚•πman the innovations we're missing out on‚•πi need to learn C‚•πwhy
cuz you wanna become a linix contributor
and they only use c
?
maybe i'll rewrite cyrch in c
hmm
what if i rewrite cyrch
in every language
and see which one is fastest
as a language learning exercise
its actually a really good project
it involves interfacing with databases
the internet
data processing
concurrence‚•πYes‚•πmongoc
i should do some c
c is just a pain
cuz like
objects
are not really a thing
it is however nice
in other respects
like
if i wanna map a number to a character a through z
also you can implement your own memory management
to get stuff done, use python.
to make websites, use JavaScript.
to make low level fast things, use c
to make low level fast things without it being a pain in the tukkus to manage dependencies and more complex data types like objects
use rust
if you take APCS
use Java
if you're a physicist
use Matlab
if you're Ben Eater
use
w i r e s‚•πrewrite
cyearch
in wires
manually implement tcp‚•πMy mom has successfully connected to Rutgers OARC Amarel
this is a very interesting system
idk exactly how it works‚•πmember methods in my language will not be self.
or
will be
since apostrophes and ownership are a thing in english
thus I have just made more logicality‚•πlol‚•πdoes that actually make any sense tho‚•πum
tbh idrk
its like
'something'.something?‚•πno
like
say you have an object
inside a class
like you know how in python
you have to do like
self.instancemethod
or java: this.instancemethod‚•πyes‚•πin wel (my programming language)
you do‚•πum‚•πif you have instantiated, it is different‚•πwhat about string literals‚•πwdym strings
oh
it doesnt end with a quote
it only starts with one‚•πbut‚•πkinda like 'a in rust
you can call the 'a anything you want
like
'randomlifeteimename
except this is totally different
but what
how will it conflict?
will be valid in my language‚•π('something, 'hello')‚•πyes
the comma
also‚•πbut‚•πthe solution is
that throws a syntax error
('something, "hello")‚•π('something, '"hello"')‚•πyes‚•π'murca‚•π'murica
is valid syntax
it autoparenthesizes it
so
not from
select all users
select(all(users))
is that the interpreter does
in cases where it cant figure it out‚•πvariable = 'something‚•π1) varargs probably wont exist
2) you just put parentheses
no
no cy
there is no equals
variable 'something‚•π?‚•πno equals
to assign a variable
if you want a string‚•πthen how do you name the variable‚•πyou do
cow "moo"
> cow
prints moo
first "thing" on the line
so if you want to increment an int 10 times and print it
you
a++ returns the value as well‚•π>10++variable‚•πwhat‚•πwould be my syntax‚•πHmm
i mean i have a better map syntax
so
if you want to do something on all the objects‚•πthat's not map syntax‚•πno
this is unrelated
say you have an array full of strings‚•πyes...‚•πyou want to add "moo" to each
python might be a = [ i + "moo" for i in a]
this is
a.* += "moo"‚•π.?
what is the .
and the star‚•πthe star
means
"do this on all the items in the list"‚•πso its kind of like
a spread operator
but not‚•πwhat is a spread operator
lol
ramesh is dumb
what
what does that do‚•πit spreads
the dict‚•πisnt that like rust
when you make a struct‚•πno that's js‚•πyou can like
copy the fields
with
..otherobject‚•πsee like
yeah
thats python as well
..
js does ...
i like js in certain ways
it has logic‚•πbut the map thing‚•πi dont like your map thing
its illogical‚•πto me it is logical
but wait cy‚•πanything.anything‚•πyou havent even heard
the highlight
of my language‚•πis one thing
not many‚•πidk but‚•πok
...‚•πthe main feature
is blocks.
everything in the language is a block‚•πfor scoping
i thought of a thing with blocks‚•πyes
the solution
to scope
is contexts
you can run a block
with a scope‚•πyeah‚•πlike a specific scope
so
when you do the
where do you think the key comes from‚•πwhat is crud‚•πcreate read update delete
it automakes
the api
for you
with its web framework called doublespeed‚•πmorethanexpress‚•πmor ethan express
anyway‚•πtf‚•πthe r is a block that will like execute on the beginning of the read method
but
but
but
context is a thing right
so some methods can take blocks
that execute in the local scope
or mixed scopes
and then
blocks are not procedures.
and you are passing a block to class
so the fundamental language is based on blocks‚•πi like simplicity
my syntax would be mostly pythonic
since it is fairly logical
that way its easy to learn
and gets rapid adoption‚•πmine is also logical
because
you can do
plain english
want me to‚•πwhat about workspaces‚•πexplain how this works
the exec block thing‚•πcollections of variables‚•πwdym collections of variables‚•πlike‚•πand wth are workspaces
thats only something in vscode
not in any language‚•πhere lemme make an example‚•πk
also good please keep challenging my language
i need to flesh it out more
so this is helping
this
is amazing
anyhow
what is a workspace‚•πa collection of variables
so sort of a scope
but it can be shared‚•πah‚•πalso idk what that async block is doing
there
you dont need it‚•πthere are no
{}
curlies
yeah I suppose contexts will do what you want
yeah
also
thats not the syntax for wel‚•πno thats the cyntax for cy
stored in a .cy file
waitfor
not wait for‚•πwait for finish of myctx
or
no
yeah
thats what ill do
what else do yo want‚•πwaitfor finish in each myctx‚•πwdym in each
that's the same thing‚•πno thats illogical what i wrote
these languages are hard to write‚•πwait for myctx finish
is what it would translate to‚•πi really like how js does events tho
so like
you would make a jobqueue
then do‚•πwhat do you think about the parenless syntax tho
lol‚•πthe problem with all these on in wait from etc
is that like
they remove variable names
frankly
what i want
is very simple
python‚•πpython isnt bad
but‚•πwith javascripts event based functionality‚•πmy language did i say
it was typed‚•πand rust's scoping‚•πwhat i want is
ruby's shortcut syntaxes
but less verbose‚•πalso console.log‚•πand more like the JVM‚•πis
very
relevant‚•πmy print‚•πthere needs to be easy logging‚•πis defined as
oh right
when I write an OS
im going to kill stdout
and stderr
there will be one thing
called
stdlog‚•πimma write an os too
at some point‚•πim going to write it in rust‚•πwhen i practice C
frankly‚•πand it's going to be‚•πit will be easier‚•πfor raspberry pis‚•πto rewrite cyrch in c
than in rust‚•πhave fun with your unsafe threading
better use those mutexes or else youre done‚•πthe threading is not unsafe in python
its actually good‚•πi meant c‚•πi had 1000 threads running
and no duplication
yeah c
uh
haha‚•πfree‚•πfunny‚•πhaha‚•πthreading‚•πtrue
maybe try go
go is just java but like
worse‚•πoh yeah forgot there was go
should try that too
tbh‚•πgo
is statically typed
and
doesnt have templating‚•πjs will probably be the fastest‚•πi mean they are adding it but it took 10 years
ruby is my weapon of choice with interpreted
personally i want a jruby
that is
not jvm
and has even more shortcuts
cy
have you tried ruby‚•πi may start doing everything in typescript‚•πyeah‚•πthen i will cease to have to worry
about all this‚•πbut have you tried ruby‚•πcuz js and typescript
work for everything
no‚•πtry it
it's so sugary‚•πk ill add it to the list
lol‚•πlike‚•πi like sugar‚•πtheres python
and then
the python replacement for me
is ruby
since ruby is so nice‚•πpython no sugar
just veggies‚•πyes
ruby is
like
just like
let me show you an example:‚•πsugar is really annoying‚•πlet's say you have a null variable‚•πbut also like‚•πhow do you check‚•πreally ncie‚•πreall yquickly
like‚•πif var‚•πthen
like‚•πwdym‚•πwhat if i wanna do like
say we have a class
it has an instance varabiel
which is a bool
and i wanna check the bool
but idk if var is null‚•πvahrabee el‚•πshut
tell me how to do it
in python‚•πum‚•πik it's simple
the instance thing is called
admin
like‚•πno theres probably a shorter syntax‚•πif user.admin
butuser
will throw an error since it's null sometimes
what if it's null huh
so you do
in ruby it's just‚•πif user and None or user.admin‚•πwhat
and
also wont that still throw an error
since it does the user.admin part
part of the check
idk actually‚•πalso in js
like
terenary things are interesting
cuz like
you can‚•πthat works‚•πlike‚•πsurprise‚•πin js
if you
do
true && "hello"
it returns hello‚•πyeah
like lisp‚•πidk what the || version of that is
lol
in js [] === [] will always be false
anyarray === anyarray
== false
js has a straightforward mapping function‚•πjs is just
cy
did you see that website‚•πno not really‚•πsee it
it is
wonderful.‚•πWeb design‚•πalso bpython good‚•πAt its greatest‚•πi clik link
linc goud
cy has to avoid failing math
he will leave
bye‚•πhi
i signed up for in person
what is GraphQL‚•πa fancy query language
for lazy frontend devs
who wanna put all the work on the backend devs
essentially
you say
gimme this data
formatted this way
and since its a query language
you can query within the structure
so something like‚•πim going to try it
it sounds like serde‚•πbananas smaller than 30 centimeters{
proteins bigger than 25 atoms
}‚•πyes
there will be no
smaller than
but that is graphql right‚•πyes
that is like
pseudo graphql‚•πlike not actually graphql
yeah
i was gonna say
but it makes a schema‚•πyes‚•πyeah
seems like a good idea
ill try it‚•πits for apis
i have yet to understand some of the implementations
but i will learn it when i need to
or next time i make an api
its another thing made by facebook
i must go
then when i come back
i must continue averting crisis in Honors Precalculus‚•πah
yes
i heard you have a test tomorrow‚•πyes and i havent studied‚•πok
go
bye
good luck‚•πsince last week‚•πyes
go do that
bye‚•πbut i worked today
for hours‚•πon this?‚•πand i have 1.5 hours left
of practice
i will now take a shower
good bye‚•πdo that
bye‚•πyou're not allowed to win
oh god
how do i
disable notifications
on my own channel
gee thanks madame koch
you put
my entire conversation

in front of the class again
in a playposit
you put me

for 2 French classes to watch and answer questions on
asd;flkjhasdf‚•πum cy
tf is ur channel doing‚•πcy is frustrated with math
he is not managing to improve his scores
last year they were all around an 82%
this year
they are very high
95%
90%
100%
and then
50%‚•πme in ap calc
100
99
98
99
100
81
then
98‚•πtheres always one or two things
that are just
bad‚•πyeah
c'est la vie‚•πI suppose
but I it means I cannot get an A
it bars me‚•πdo you want to take BC‚•πi wanna take AB then BC‚•πgood
dont take just bc
AB is easier anyway‚•πwhat are you taking‚•πAB
next year BC‚•πok‚•πI could've taken BC
But my parents convinced me to not
so I didn't
I do not regret taking AB‚•πi am not sure what to do
with this year
i practice and practice
and it amounts to this
its like‚•πsome things are just not easy
some things work out
I think that's what happens to me
I kept trying at that thing i got an 81
and then
i kept getting it wrong
ill probably disappear till thursday
i have a heck load of tests coming up
barrage‚•πAh nice‚•πAPUSH, Physics, Calc
I really need to study for calc
im not getting it wrong per se
im paranoid tho now
so I really need to practice a lot‚•πI need to study for apush‚•πI love how inheritance is often irrelevant in dynamically typed languages
cy
is cy in precalc? probably‚•πthe ten words that have just been stated are false.‚•πcy how are you going to filter NSFW content from cyearch
you would be really rich if you invested in moderna‚•πEh kinda‚•πit went
from 13 dollars
to like
165
in the past year‚•πFrom 2020-2021
If u invested then yea
If u invest now not really‚•πyeah
but then
if you had in march last year
you would be‚•πPretty sure thats what people did
I think people just invested in the sector
What bout it?‚•πlo que pasar√°, pasar√°
or
lo que ser√° ser√°‚•πAh i should change my github status thingy‚•πthis is mine
also ur pfp is good‚•πYea i like it‚•πI like mine too
it's a bird‚•πWhich type?‚•πA blue jay I think
Not 100% sure
sinŒ∏
these are my emacs configs‚•πyea i saw
they look nice
see
should i get a start page?‚•πyes
they r nice
they look good‚•πcause i can
but its kinda useless
ill do it why not‚•πlol
i gtg now
bye
cy
do you respect robots.txt?
maybe that might help
also idk if you know but wel's contexts might just be dictionaries
like
you can define dictionaries but they are called contexts
cmake?
i couldnt ever figure out the build systems
i might try ninja‚•πi see‚•πthats like
the #1 reason i didnt learn C
raspberry pi‚•πLight3s?‚•πk3s server
running alpine‚•πAh nice‚•πlightweight AF‚•πMy hyperv kinda isn‚Äôt creating vm for some reason
So i can‚Äôt get k3s to work‚•πcall rahul from mumbai tech support‚•πAh yes‚•πhe will scan for virus on computer‚•πOf course‚•πand tell if you need spyware cleaner
i was going to say is this go
but why is point defined twice‚•πidk‚•πmm
also that font
try jetbrains mono
Lol‚•πlol funny
cuz
i didnt
copy that
i actually thought of this‚•π‚Ä¶ oh.
i should try C‚•πOH GOD
one line of Python
one line‚•πreally?
one line?
whawhat is the one line‚•πmake a bson document
like
its literally
passed in as a dictionary
cuz those are a thing
in the modern world‚•πtry rust?‚•πno im using c rn‚•πlol‚•πhi my name is cy
and i got mongoc to work‚•πHi yc
my gosh
that's good
how about threading‚•πlol
we're getting there
first i have to figure out the pattern‚•πI would try to develop this in rust at the same time‚•πof what is a pointer
and what is an acutal variable‚•πbut I am going to do work soon
so no‚•πlemme now try some http requests‚•πtry libcurl
i wonder if paying a little trip to russia could be uesful
like
my genesis thing says that I will go on apri 1st
but the form said the 26th‚•πidk
it is now time
to read memory without permission‚•πdid you mean segfault?‚•πthis allocates memory
writes to it
prints it out to the terminal
then
it frees the memory
and once again prints it out to the terminal‚•π‚Ä¶
isn't it reading unallocated memory then‚•πyes
it is
lol i tried to read from memory location 0‚•πis this wsl‚•πyes‚•πwhat does it show on windows‚•πidk i didn't feel like compiling for windows
and installing things‚•πlol‚•πtime to fill up lots of memory
and then free it
as a test
haha yes
dynamic arrays
"arrays"
lol‚•πare you like
reimplementing strings‚•πi guess‚•πcygh
i got the wrong book
i need an aarch64 book
what an idiot I am
still not working
oh wait
it doesnt actually FILL it
im stupid
not enough‚•πhi ramesh
how tf does jrunner5 work
i need to make it connect to the server
do i need to make environment variables or something
also the path needs to be variable
also if they are environment variables please change that
to like
a config file‚•πwhat
umm
i forgot lol‚•πdammit now Java is being a pain‚•πlemme see‚•πi need to set my JAVA_HOME
variable
idk what to set it to‚•πit uses
env vars
and why do you want it to use a file‚•πcuz then like
its very portable
you just gradlew run
and that's it‚•πwhat aint portable about env vars‚•πyou have to set them‚•πok‚Ä¶
and you have to set the configuration file‚•πonly once‚•πsame with env vars‚Ä¶
if you do it right‚•πno not if you move it to a different system
with python i use dotenv
then like
its portable‚•πmhm
i would add a dotenv
to jrunner5
is that ok‚•πwell its effectively a config file
so yes‚•πok
lol‚•πok‚•πill add this‚•πalso make the path variable‚•πone sec‚•πfor now i need to un-die java
ramesshhhh‚•πyes‚•π*yawn‚•πuse java 15‚•πwhat am i using?‚•πalso i am not doing the dotenv now‚•π1.8‚•πi have too much work
you need 1.15‚•πum
ok
ramesh
um
is Jrunner5 supposed to make an error
or something
or react at all
if anything is sent‚•πyes‚•πok, its not‚•πit is supposed to react‚•πum‚•πill see‚•πlike
i sent it a json
which is wrong
but
it didn't throw an error
or display
anything‚•πshow me
what it shows
it may not react if it's invalid
sounds fine
try using the test py file‚•πok
rameshshshsh
how do i
make a protobuf
to send
ramesh
its not
working
the protobuf
asflka;jsdlfkja;sdlkfj
why do we have to use protobuf
lol i spel
also if you want proof that protobufs are just like
strings that are a mess
is a protobuf
smh
i almost have this working
i just need to stop being dumb
and implement things‚•πdid you see the example code
it makes protobufs
also im doing work
bye
ill help yu during CSC ill be done then‚•πlol‚•πlike i have way too much work‚•πi got it working‚•πso
nice‚•πi spel
it werk‚•πalso someone
find out
why it says i am going to school irl on april first
because thats not what the form said and im confused
and i want to know the answer‚•πidk ill ask my parents later‚•πk‚•πand see what they say‚•πmy parents said the 26th
but
my friends said the 1st
like
earlier than the first
which sounds wrong
but ok‚•πidk‚•πbut tell me what you hear
bye‚•πbye
hi status update
things sort of work
at least sending jobs does
but
jrunner5
only works the first time
like you connect it
send it a job
it works
returns the result
then you send it another job
and it dies and vomits an exception
its sufficient tho for now
so when ramesh has a moment
we will discuss‚•πshow error‚•πi have to eat dinner
bye‚•πcy problem
try using wsl or lunix
bye
ok actually it might not be but ill figure it out later
no actually it might be a you problem
lol
bye‚•πok but it works the first time
just not the second time‚•πwait gimme the website to ur codetools‚•πthis may involve me
so try it‚•πnot on the big web
atm
yes
why?‚•πweb-view
with rust‚•πinteresting‚•πits like a lightweight electron
really lighweight‚•πi see
see right now
i need to implement job reprovisioning
so that each time ramesh's jrunner dies
it will provision to a new one‚•πit
does not die on my end
let me try‚•πactually
hold on
ramesh
the thing is online
do this
connect a jrunner instance
on your end
to my server
wait no that wont work cuz i need to unblock ur ip
tell me ur ip‚•πwait
one second‚•πtry and connect
i allowed ur ip
i am not seeing anything
on my end‚•πim
not connected yet‚•πok
will you be connected
soon‚•πyes‚•πok‚•πactually no
idk why
but it wont compile‚•πwhats the error‚•πwait a few minutes
some type mismatches‚•πok
but is this a different version from the one i have‚•πi dont think so‚•πthen why wont it compile‚•πi think
the library updated itself‚•πok‚•πik what happened‚•πok...‚•πok
it connected‚•πooh it did
lemme try and run something
it ran right‚•πyes‚•πok now lemme run again‚•πit died‚•πand now it died‚•πok strange
let me see why‚•πtell me if you want me to run something‚•πyes
do that‚•πagain?‚•πno‚•πok‚•πi want to try something first
before
try
i will entertain this till 9:11
then I must go
ok try again
ah ok so it fails to receive correctly‚•πok...‚•πtry
again
wack
are you sure the client is working properly‚•πwdym
that is the client
jrunner5‚•πi mean the server‚•πi mean
its doing the same thing each time
i think
can you like
print out what the program recieves‚•πues
it does not
receive‚•πum‚•πit does not receive anything and that is where it throws the error
btw
wait
wait
wait‚•πi am waiting‚•πtry
nvm
ok try
again
it says
deflate
so this is likely some kind of deflation issue
on your server side‚•πum
i have made many websocket servers
with python websockets
that all work
just fine‚•πim thinking this is deflate‚•πi can attempt to disable the deflation thing‚•πyes do that
and then call me back‚•πok
you have to disable it in kotlin tho
so do that‚•πi will‚•πk lemme see how to disable it on my end
oh that was easy
ok compression is off
and the browser just accepts that‚•πok
try now
again
it probs wont work
nvm
it worked.
it worked.
ha.
ha ha.‚•πyes it works now
that is
good‚•πthis is temporary
we will get deflate to work
but not today‚•πok um‚•πill push my changes‚•πok‚•πtry it out‚•πok one moment‚•πill stay until it works
also
i changed the path
to /ecws/runner
i will make the path variable in the future‚•πok
dammit
yup
its
working
now 2 of them can be connected
and it will like
choose the one with the least running jobs
*cough once i implement deleting the job when its done‚•πdo you want me to keep mine running‚•πsure‚•πk‚•πjust run it rn
i wanna see what happens‚•πk
i did‚•πit seems to default to mine
interesting
actually
stop yours‚•πstopped‚•πok
imma do more stuff‚•πdo you want it on or off‚•πleave it off
cuz also
like
if i restart the server‚•πyeah‚•πit will disconnect‚•πit will
crash
i have to fix that
if you wanna make me fix it open an issue
or ill forget‚•πit doesn't matter that much
we can see later‚•πk
i gtg
bye‚•πbye‚•πThat was caused by me
Lol‚•πyes
and also
it doesn't work
just wait
it will
eventually...‚•πOk‚•πyou have to set
your env vars
smh‚•πthis is driving me insane
TF is the deal with those margins
i must attack the margins
bye
hi my name is Madame Koch
you wanna hear something funny‚•πyou?
oh
eleves‚•πcdknight: students‚•πoh‚•πthe math teacher told us there were ways she could prevent us from using calculators for matrices
like putting variables in them‚•π‚Ä¶‚•πjokes on her
numworks‚•πLma
lol
does it actually‚•πyes‚•πnice
lol
undef‚•πTI‚•πKhiCAS might do even better
i wanna vaccine‚•πramesh‚•πhello
i qualify‚•πhi
yes
but
idk‚•πlol‚•πlol
imma email mrs baker and tell her to use numworks‚•πyes
kill TI‚•πTI bad‚•πyes
overpriced
unfriendly to hobbyists‚•πbut also like
in order to get a TI emulator
you have to like‚•πSAT approved ‚úÖ‚•πshe cant pretty sure‚•πwhy not‚•πcause the curriculum teaches with TI's‚•πyeah but like
have you tried to make a matrix on a numworks‚•πthere might be cases where they might be open-minded‚•πand a ti‚•πyou still
learn the same stuff‚•πwell no so heres the thing‚•πyea but she has to show whichever one the majority has‚•πshe told ppl
to go into the testnav‚•πand the textbooks as well teach TI's‚•πto get a TI
and im like‚•πlol
or me‚•πi need to learn how to use the TI tho
otherwise imma be killed at some point
when they tell me
i cant use my numworks‚•πi know how to use a TI
it's
slow
literally is there anything else I can say
if you want to know how the pandemic changed me it has nothing to do with either of these‚•πoh wait
the numworks does not do variables in matrices
only Omega does‚•πlol
omega is good
also‚•πyes‚•πsomeone should make a TI84 emu
for the numworks os‚•πlol‚•πwhat
it probs can run it‚•πits ARM
ti is ti‚•πthe ti is z80‚•πso you would need an emulator
to emulate the ti architecture
you would also need TI firmware‚•πhey cy
did you know that james
according to him
is gay and polygamous‚•πum
i did not know‚•πwhat tf is ur cyhannel doing?
its sent out like at least 3000 messages‚•πshould i change jrunner5's wss mode to "slave client"
i mean idk but i agree that changing "master" to "main" is silly‚•πRunner node

hi my name is create-react app
and the world revolves around me‚•πum
new zealand

officially‚•πyes‚•πok
good‚•πi hate
compiled‚•πnow you will assert your superior screwmanship‚•πinterpreted languages‚•πum
that is
what wel will be
do you hate wel‚•πit drives me insane
its like
a;sdlkfja;sdlkfj‚•πno well will be more like
bytecode‚•πwhy is it so hard
to deal with this
create-react-app‚•πwhy is it so hard to write a garbage collector
imma ask matt
do you know matt‚•πthere is like
literally
no way
to
make my flask compatible html
with create-react-app
it just
wont work‚•πyes
because {{ right‚•πno
because it like
changes everything‚•πthis is why i gave up
basically:‚•πhold on imma keep experimenting‚•πyou're not supposed to mix the server-side and client-side rendering together
you are
supposed to write an API
and then use that API with the frontend
and have two separate projects‚•πthat's not the part im dealing with rn
but yes
that is
correct
and sad
and correct
but ok
not too sad
right now
create-react app
ok
so
this is what it does
it
makes a bunch of js and css files
that are like some random hex code
.js
and then it generates an html file
with the required tags
to import this
and it changes the filenames
with each build
so its not like i can create a static html file
that jinja sees
so its just
a pain
imma figure it out bye‚•π18.5k messages lol‚•πlol‚•πlol
hi samantha
long time no see‚•πYe
I keep forgetting I have this muted‚•πlol‚•πCuz the amount of spam‚•πit's not spam
it's just‚•πand power supply‚•πhigh quality spam‚•πU get what I mean
I don‚Äôt wanna get constantly pinged during class‚•πtrue
does someone know if they block telegram in school‚•πno
not‚•πyeah but like‚•πblocked‚•πthey blocked
stuff
during mp3‚•πum
i could set up a vpn server in the school‚•πi was thinking‚•πand then be able to test things remotely‚•πof mailing 5 dollars to mullvad
i can get someone
to turn on the computer
so akhil can control it‚•πi dont have access
its under akhils account
also that's weird
see what i want‚•πhe can share it with you‚•πwhat i want‚•πi think if you run a pi
it oculd work‚•πis to set up a vpn server
in the school
that is on a vpn‚•πinto the school‚•πso‚•πright
you can get into the school right‚•πIts still on my account‚•πinbound requests come from a vpn at home‚•πWhich is great‚•πand then they go into that vpn‚•πbut it will be slow
right
or do u not have garbagoptimum‚•πgimme back access
so i can connect‚•πHe doesnt
Uh one second‚•πwhats the school speedtest‚•πWhats ur email?‚•π1.2 gbps‚•πwifi?‚•πno ethernet‚•πwhat‚•πwifi is 750 mbps‚•πis the wifi speed
ah
up or down tho‚•πboth
on a gigabit usb ethernet adapter
so like
it could be faster‚•πok so
you want to run a vpn server in the school
like a gateway‚•πyes‚•πinside the schol
and have it not broadcast its ssid
1) how are you going to power it‚•πU need port forwarding don‚Äôt u?‚•πno‚•πlisten to me
i ask
someone
like
mrs tan‚•π‚Ä¶‚•πif i can install it
in the classroom‚•π‚Ä¶
ok ‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶
no comment‚Ä¶
ok
what are you going to say it does‚•πallows me to connect remotely
tbh idrc
its just a fun idea‚•πi wanna like
run a vpn in aws
then I can just
connect to the vpn in aws‚•πwhy tho
just run it at home‚•πU should be added back
RH-623-05‚•πi no see‚•πI sent u the invite link to the vnc team‚•πoh wait‚•πcy
did you forget
i have garboptimum?‚•πYup same here
I may not tho‚•πalso
security concerns
of just
leaving my ip open‚•πlol‚•πit's not huge‚•πthe computer is not listening
for cloud connections‚•πGet mullvad‚•πmullvad
might get blocked‚•πCause its prob not on‚•πyeah‚•πcy‚•πyes‚•πif you do do the rpi thing
then
"test if any site is blocked in BTSD and learn how to access it"‚•πlol
i have to wrestle with create-react-app
bye‚•πbye
hi akhil
hows ur rust going‚•πpretty well‚•πshow‚•πi have to create an initial model right
so im trying to think what i would need‚•πyou have multiple components‚•πwell not components
like data
the initial model is i32‚•πumm
just like‚•πbecause all it is is a counter‚•πusb
device
and then
data
but what does the first page do‚•πwell no its i need iso path as string, usb path as vector probably
its a structure
iso than usb device
similar to popsicle
yea this has to go under msg or something
im still lookin at documentation‚•πlol
lol‚•πah how convienent
imma try without it tho‚•πlol gnome is written in javascript‚•πreally?
whats typescript?
etcher uses it apparently‚•πetcher is hot garbage
uh
i think it's some typing system for javascript
adds static typing to js
personally akhil
i would stay the hell away from js
just use kotlin if you want js‚•πyea its not the greatest‚•πit can
compile into js‚•πi was considering to just like do it in cocoa and make my life a bit easier
but thats stupid
ill try it after‚•π‚Ä¶‚•πi need something that can be served up using web-view‚•π:( not native mac app pls
no one can use that except mac users‚•πnah dont worry
i aint doing it‚•πalso add a safe mode to urs‚•πi want it to be cross platform
?
what would it do‚•πso u cant
flash ur hard drive by accident‚•πoh yea of course
im having it not like recognize ur hard drive
Tf is http/3?‚•πhttp3

hi my name is windows‚•πhi my name is shuf‚•πdinosaurous rex‚•πwrite‚•πsmh‚•πthe script in python‚•πno that's a pain‚•πos.system('cy is being a bad')
that's what I do
lol‚•πi just wrote a .ps1 file
and it works
for the linix ppl
just change Copy-Item to cp
and rename it to .sh‚•πlol windows haha funny‚•πwhere is that
ok now my PowerShell script works
so that is good
so to build the react portion of the app‚•πmake your programs more cross-platform‚•πand if you're on linux
you just
make your own
batch file
shell script
cuz if ur on linix
im sure you're capable‚•πno
i hate batch scripts
bash*
i just hate bash
it is the most god awful garbage‚•πthen do it manually
it literally
runs the build
then
copies the files
to the right location‚•πyes
python can do this
in
5 lines
and is cross platform
unlike bash and ps‚•πyou can make a pull request
if you so desire‚•πok
i will
l8r‚•πok
haha yes
i have defeated it
it cannot beat me
you can now
open any code
and it will open
the newly built
codetools-react
that took
a very
long time
so now there are a few things left to do
1. actually make the runner thing work
2. add a ui for managing your content
3. draft/publish functionality for challenges
oh and then the myriad of rate limiters that this thing is gonna need‚•πsince what the actual garbage is this‚•πidk i would need to check
and that is cumbersome
spotify's backend is essentially all python
they cite
ease and speed of development
and the fact that all their engineers already know it
no, but i didn't want to
i dont need it
cuz
ios simulator
works without it‚•πthe one in xcode?‚•πyeah‚•πcool‚•πi worked on codetools
it like
loads now
the editor
but the login probably doenst work‚•πlmao the page isn‚Äôt loading‚•πwait
now it is‚•πwait it just did
Yeah still no signup‚•πi should fix that
idk what ramesh did to it‚•πI put
The variables
In dotenc‚•πthat's bad
dont do that‚•πthat is good
i will do that
otherwise‚•πimma put it back in the HTML‚•πi have to manually
edit
your code
and I do not
want to manually
edit your code
and then it will break on your end‚•πyeah but otherwise the code is a pain‚•πand then you change it
and then it will break on my end
so just use what i put in‚•πtrue

but you can put in whatever you want
also you can add a filter if that makes the code better‚•πi have the actual one
somewhere‚•πcool
but you just
put that in your .env‚•πi have to find it‚•πand fly

change the font
monaco died again for me
with its broken emoji font‚•πctrl+f5‚•πno
work not‚•πskreenshot‚•πno runner nodes E07‚•πwait i have to start one‚•πit werk in crhome
no me
no me cy‚•πpog‚•π2 on line‚•πramesh your issue‚•πcy ur load balancer is bad‚•πis a linix issue‚•πor‚•πit works in firefox‚•πjust change
the font
it works in chrome
change the font to something that is not the default
please
segoe‚•πit is not the default‚•πdoes not work
it loads emoji in firefox
can you just change it‚•πit is set to DM Mono‚•πso whaddya want me to do‚•πlol wait
hold on‚•πactually like
fix my font configuration?‚•πhold on
it might not
be‚•πit is not‚•πgimme a moment‚•πimagine conveniently blaming everything on lunix‚•πit is a linux issue
it works in windows
and mac
i think
cuz matt is not complaining‚•πdm mono
is not
on lunix
or mac‚•πno its not set to DM Mono‚•πyes
if it were‚•πi need to figure out what the prop is‚•πi would not have the problem‚•πno actually ramesh
if you had your system configured correctly
it wouldnt be an issue
the only reason im fixing this
is for you
it works
for everyone
but you‚•πit would be an issue
because
dm mono is supposed to be the font
and it is not‚•πtrue‚•πthus it is an issue‚•πnow i need
to identify
the prop
that is used to change the font‚•πlol haha funny apparently 2x = 0.5y so x = y‚•πi see
i fixed it
now
i have to build it
lemme do that
fixed
on the server
if you reload
you will see
DM Mono‚•πyes
also
this isnt a linux problem‚•πthen explain‚•πthis is a firefox on linux problem
it worked in chrome‚•πsame thing‚•πno
also it works in firefox now‚•πyes
i tried to run it on pypy
but i couldnt install cryptography‚•πum
also why is it never using my jrunner‚•πum
i think
its because
mine is first in the set‚•πbad load balancer‚•πand the jobs finish so fast
it just always goes to that one
i mean
this is like
first iteration
of that load balancer‚•πok
kill ur jrunner5
lets see hwat happens‚•πdead‚•πit uses mine now
cool‚•πyes that part works
its just the preference part doesn't work
i mean‚•πbugs‚•πum
why am i able to access that
oh wait
cuz
its a challenge
oh also yes
the running functionality
is like
bare minimum‚•πok fine‚•πit doesn't do challenges yet

‚Ä¶
what is the point of this‚•πit really doesnt matter for guys i think
its just changing the girls white gowns to the same green one‚•πBut why?‚•πlisten
they are explaining‚•πSo why are the only people speaking female?‚•πbecause there is no change to males‚•πOr "non-binary"‚•πcause it affects them‚•πYeah, but should male opinion be expressed?‚•πdr lazovick‚•πNo
I
mean students
Could I say that by only using female voices, this is biased?‚•πbecause what would they say‚•πWhat the females said‚•πthey are not affected
they still wear green‚•πI know
it's like
idk what to say‚•πif you are discussing the conditions of African americans
do you go and interview white ppl‚•πNo but
if you are talking about a change related to african americans
would you ask white ppl
what they think‚•πif it affects them‚•πso this strictly only applies to girls
ok
this is pointless
why should i watch this if I am a boy‚•πbecause it is relevant for you to understand
what is going on‚•πwhy
it doesn't affect me
thus i shouldnt care‚•πno not directly‚•πits like the news‚•πbut its a lesson‚•πthen‚•πand the news yes‚•πwhy cant male opinions be said
if it doesnt affect me at all
then
why am I watching this
it does affect me, thus I am watching this
therefore‚•πits a lesson about gender‚•πIt does concern me in some way
thus
I should be hearing male opinions as well
Since it does affect me in some indirect way‚•πwhat would a male say ramesh‚•πi mean they could say the same thing‚•πexactly
it could
inspire confidence
also
why did they choose green not white
for the entire community‚•πi mean if the student president or whatever was a male
then there would be‚•πthat poses another problem‚•πcause green is a like a prominent ridge color is it not?‚•πwhat percentage of the student government is female
true
but what if more people like white‚•πi mean
yea its a valid point ig
white and green are ridge colors‚•πand what if like
males
dont want
green‚•πits not about the color‚•πwe dont get a choice‚•πI know‚•πits about the number of colors‚•πyea‚•πwhat if im a male and i want it to be white
what if they just left it up to choice
i need to pay attention
he talked about this‚•πits more of the idea of unity‚•πthere must be tradition and uniformity‚•πI guess
I'm not necessarily against this‚•πits not a bad choice
idrc what i wear on graduation tbh‚•πI think the idea is fine‚•πWait what did u guys do in advisory bc my teacher isn‚Äôt here and I didn‚Äôt see it‚•π‚Ä¶
someone else explain this
i dont feel like it‚•πEssentially
the girls graduation gows are changing colors
from the traditional white to the green
same as the guys‚•πOk thats it?‚•πin order to be inclusive to those that are non-binary/outside the male to female
yup‚•πoh ok that makes sense
Honestly kinda weird in the first place to have 2 different colored gowns‚•πidk its probably to make it look nice
cause during graduation it would be field of green and white‚•πBruh ridge colors are already so messed up we the red devils but we green‚•πtrue
i forgot bout the red devils
why‚•πBc we used to be merged with another school they got the color we got the name
so they are the green devils iirc‚•πalso
My arguments (note: please substitute "I" for "binary males") 

1) If this doesn't impact me in some way, then I wouldn't be watching this. Since it does have some impact, it does concern me in some way.

2) Since it concerns me in some way, it does impact me. Therefore, considering that it does have some sort of impact on me (even if it's indirect), there is an impact.

3) Therefore, I should have a voice, since I am affected by this in some way, and I should be able to express whatever voice I have. If there are people who are binary males who do have qualms with this, by having someone from their gender-field agree that this is a good idea might help them feel more confident about the change, so it wouldn't hurt.
I made my arguments more clear‚•π? how does it affect males‚•πThe color of the females' gowns changes
which is a visual change
Although that's not the entry point I'm using to springboard my argument‚•πThen what is?‚•πI'm saying that
If it doesn't affect me
then I wouldn't be watching this
So no matter what it is that does affect me in this
If it didn't concern me I wouldn't have to watch it‚•πSo are you saying that you don't like they are doing it or just don't care?‚•πNo
I'm saying that it's a good idea but
I think when they were presenting it‚•πfrom my understanding he wants male opinion to be there‚•πThey should have had binary males also support it
In that livestream session thing
Although that wouldn't have changed my opinion, I just think it'd have been more balanced in terms of "student voice"‚•πBut like what would a guy have said? "We aren't doing anything different."‚•πNo
They would have spoken in support of what the other people said
Not talk about the lack of change with males
Like "I think this is a great idea, I've spoken to lots of people and lots of my male friends agree this is more equal and unified than before and helps bring us together as a school."
Also I'm done with this
I gotta start working on emotesui‚•π...
who knew
tf is this for‚•πthis is great
should i try this?‚•πSure‚•πI have a chat I'd like to run this on

The short story
I just finished reading the short story
It was rly gud‚•πhow long did it take‚•πaround 15 mins
I read quickly‚•πthat sounds about right
did you notice any discrepancies
and/or did you feel any emotions‚•πWell, we had all these children out planting trees, see, because we figured that ... that was part of their education, to see how, you know, the root systems ... and also the sense of responsibility, taking care of things, being individually responsible. You know what I mean. And the trees all died.‚•πLorem ipsum carrots‚•πlol
They were orange trees. I don‚Äôt know why they died, they just died. Something wrong with the soil possibly or maybe the stuff we got from the nursery wasn‚Äôt the best. We complained about it. So we‚Äôve got thirty kids there, each kid had his or her own little tree to plant and we‚Äôve got these thirty dead trees. All these kids looking at these little brown sticks, it was depressing.‚•πare you writing something‚•πno

"
The hotel was constructed between 1971 and 1974 by Lebanese developer Abdal Mohsin Kattan[1] and designed by French architect Andr√© Wogenscky, working with Lebanese architect Maurice Hindi√©.[2] The 26-story hotel included a revolving restaurant on the top floor, a nightclub on the 25th floor, and 400 guest rooms.[3] It was part of a mixed-use complex known as St. Charles City Center, including a cinema, offices, shops, restaurants, a supermarket. It was constructed on the site of the Hospital St Charles, which had been founded by the German religious order of Saint Charles Borromeo in 1908, but had moved to Baabda, north of Beirut, in 1963.[4] The Holiday Inn opened in 1974, at the height of Beirut's economic boom, when the city was the glamorous tourist center of the Middle East.

The Holiday Inn operated normally for only a year before the Lebanese Civil War broke out in 1975. The hotel was a war zone beginning on October 25, 1975[3] in a months-long conflict known as the Battle of the Hotels, as over 25,000 combatants fought for control of a group of towering luxury hotels including the Holiday Inn and the adjacent Phoenicia Inter-Continental, resulting in over 1000 deaths (many of those who died were thrown from the top of the Holiday Inn)[1] and 2000 injuries.[5] The hotel was seen as a heavily symbolic goal by both sides in the conflict, and fighting for it was fierce, finally ending on March 21, 1976.[6]


The Holiday Inn in 1990
After the battle, the ruined hotel was stripped to its concrete skeleton by scavengers.[5] It became a battleground again during the 1982 Lebanon War. Since then, the hotel has remained a gutted, bullet-riddled ruin, looming over the city. The ownership of the structure is split. The Lebanese company that owns half of it, Compagnie Immobiliere Libanaise, wants to renovate it and convert it to condos, while the Kuwaiti group that owns half of it wants to demolish it and construct a new tower on the site.[5] As a result of the disagreement, it remains empty and untouched, decades after the war and its brief year of operation; due to its strategic location in Beirut's city centre, the ruined hotel and its immediate surrounding ground level areas were declared a military zone under the control of the Lebanese Army, which currently restricts access to civilians.‚•πHi, I can english‚•πit is still standing there
it "looms"
its like
the tallest building
in the city‚•πhave you seen it before‚•πyes‚•πhaha‚•πits like
in the middle‚•πthe pyongyang hotel is very tall‚•πof the like‚•πbut it is unbuilt‚•πnicest part of the city‚•πlike it looks great‚•πhere‚•πlol‚•πcy's photos
¬© Cy
its really sad‚•πIt's just there
I think they should keep it like this
it is a symbol
right‚•πno
they should
get
rid of it
before
it kills ppl‚•πwdym kills people‚•πby falling down‚•πoh
um
why will it fall down
i may have missed that part‚•πum
because
it has been in ruins
since 1975‚•πso
like
you could gut a building
and it could still be structurally sound
right‚•πyes
you could
but
if it has
bomb craters in it
and is not being maintained‚•πyeah
or they could like
turn it into a war museum
like make it again like this
but not bad‚•πwhats sad is like
my mom's parents
were building a house
at this time
they built a house
by the shore
a really nice house
i have a picture of it too‚•πwait when was this
like
in the 70s?‚•πyes
it was actually not completely done with construction‚•πI see‚•πwhen the war came
it was mostly done
they were still installing some of the inside fixtures
i think my mom has a picture
of her and her brother
in the garage‚•πWhat happened to it
did it get destroyed‚•πthe war came
i mean
not really
it was just
like
it was left‚•πdid someone take it‚•πno the came and gutted it‚•πthat is sad‚•πlike the scavengers
yes
it is sad‚•πso unfair‚•πit was my grandfather's dream
to have that house
he was gonna host businesses in the lower floor
it had storefronts
like
like the ones on the bottom of buildings in cities‚•πit's like that book I read
where they are growing up in south vietnam
and the father has a storefront and has a business
and one day the north vietnamese authorities come in
and confiscate his business
and they are sent to some remote village
where you have to cross a moat‚•πi see‚•πthat book was actually great‚•πmy mom's family fled to france‚•πit was written by someone's mom
like someone from my grade
and then that kid moved to singapore‚•πi see
im just like
depressed about lebanon
i am like
connected to it
im supposed to care about it
and theres like
no hope‚•πI am supposed to care about india
but i dont
but like
india is a different place‚•πyes
idk
my grandparents are still there
they talk to me
and tell me how bad everything is‚•πis lebanon as bad as the other middle eastern countries
as in like
the ones that are like war‚•πno
its not at war anymore‚•πnot like iran or saudi arabia‚•πits just
depressing‚•πis it like
the aftermath of war long ago‚•πyes‚•πrecovering
from that‚•πand the recent explosion
and then now theres inflation
and no one has money
and no one has food‚•πHow bad is like
COVID-19 ther‚•πabout as bad as it is here‚•πum
that is bad‚•πi mean‚•πdid your grandparents get vaccinated‚•πyes
which is‚•πmine did as well‚•πsurprising
imo‚•πindia is supposed to be semi-advanced I think
but like
its vaccine rollout
it's like godawful‚•πidk i just like‚•πmaybe‚•πbefore that explosion‚•πthat is becuase india has a huge population
so i cant count‚•πthere were nice things about Lebanon‚•πis there now nothing‚•πwell
all that nice waterfront
is destroyed
all the old buildings
are destroyed‚•πwhat about
not beirut‚•πthe mountains
are still there
they are the only thing
that remains‚•πcan they destroy the mountains‚•πno they cant
luckily
the mountains will remain
they are not ephemeral like everything else
they are permanent‚•πthat is good‚•πidk‚•πthis takes so long
still less bad than SMS‚•πlol‚•πill never upload a file to SMS‚•πsms doesn't do files
its MMS‚•πyeah‚•πMultimedia Messaging System‚•πif you dont know
i dont use SMS much
so i forgot mms exists
my parents use RCS‚•πme neither
mine telegram‚•πjust those pesky ifone users
i tried to get my parents to use matrix
that did not work‚•πi forced my parents to use telegram
whats funny is like‚•πdo they use it with each other‚•πsince telegram has all their contacts
no
like
every time one of my friends parents
or my brother's friends parents
or a family friend
or whoever downloads telegram
they get notified
and it gives them more reason to switch
completely‚•πthat is good
appparently
rcs is getting
e2ee‚•πwhat is that‚•πend to end‚•πah
yes
telegram is
*cough
not‚•πsomething that telegram doesnot have
well
it has it on mak
but it doesnt work right
matrix does e2ee well now
like actually well
read‚•πtelegram is russian
except
not really‚•πpavel is like‚•πcuz like
Durov then left Russia and stated that he had "no plans to go back"[26] and that "the country is incompatible with Internet business at the moment".‚•πkittsandnevitsian‚•πoof russia

i dont want
to have the guidance conversation
ok‚•πok
but like
i mean‚•πread it

you will see why‚•πi may see why‚•πit's "questionable" is how I put it‚•πcy is mentally abnormal
weird things happen in cy's mind‚•πlorem ipsum carrots‚•πno
like‚•πi know‚•πactual weird things‚•πI would like to say I'm the same but I am not‚•πcy is suddenly
scared
of anything
he cant see
closets
walls
like a childish fear‚•πthat is interesting‚•πthat there is
a monster
in the closet‚•πyou should
make a story out of your sudden scaredness‚•πnot a monster per se
but‚•πit would be good‚•πyou know‚•πI suppose‚•πi could make a story
but
*yawn‚•π"time" is my guess
idk
you should read the first two pages‚•πcy also
is like‚•πwhen you sleep‚•πthere are 2 cy's
cy by day
and cy by night‚•πAh
well what I do is
I put the thing on my ereader
and i read‚•πcy by night gets depressed sometimes‚•πred‚•πcy by night is really productive sometimes
cy by day is not afraid to try new things
so he does
then
in the night
he becomes depressed
with the new things
he has tried‚•πwhat does "depression" mean to you‚•πa state
of
low feeling
and hurting
in the stomach
and non productivity‚•πdemotivation‚•πand tiredness
and
sadness‚•πI suppose
I described this not badly
in my story
I got many of those points‚•πcy is very tired‚•πI am going to bed
bye‚•πcy wishes to cease this discussion
and ramesh is leaving
so‚•πI should've went to sleep earlier
bye‚•πbye

total ve lewis dot diagram perspective drawing hybridization electron pair geometry molecular geometry‚•πno
bad‚•π*14‚•πramesh is not tired yet from his vaccine‚•πi see‚•πmy left arm
is
weird
but whatever‚•πthats always the case with vaccines
cy is still confused about gatsby
but its ok
he will understand
eventually‚•πU guys feel weird when u get vaccines?‚•πi mean a week ago i got 2
in the same arm‚•πSometimes it will feel a bit like numbnes, but most of the time i dont feel anything‚•πat the same time‚•πAh‚•πbut like
idk‚•πWhich ones do u need that u need 2?‚•πthe second one hurt a lot
idk i was due for 2 different ones‚•πHuh
I think im all caught up‚•πone time the nurse like
just
stabbed it in me
like
really fast
that was like
scary
but it hurts less‚•πAh that‚Äôs not great
Idk they never ever hurt‚•πthey ususally dont hurt
but that second one
idk
it hurt a lot‚•πidk‚•πand lots of blood came out‚•πThat shouldnt happen‚•πmy left arm feels restricted and a bit numb‚•πYea thats fine‚•πcy is so tempted to write his blog with something other than gatsby
but
he refuses
to do that‚•πI just move it extra if that happens
Why do u want a blog?‚•πjust because
learning and so forth‚•πyou could write your own
in jekyll‚•πi could‚•πok imma not type
i wanna like‚•πbut im not doing that‚•πrest my arm‚•πramesh was it the moderna or Pfizer
or jnj‚•πProbably pfizer
Not that many places have contracts with jnj‚•πmy mom is like‚•πModerna is 18+ i believe‚•πa little scared of the jnj one
shes in biomed
so like‚•πCause it has 60-70%‚•πno its like
the mRNA or whatever‚•πCause it uses old tech‚•πno new tech‚•πPfizer and moderna use new tech
Jnj is the same as the old ones
Jnj uses 1 dose‚•πoh wait
jnj uses‚•πThe others r new ones so they use 2‚•πan
adenovirus vector
not mrna
mrna is moderna and pfizer‚•πYup
This is old tech
This is fancy new ones‚•πhmm
i see‚•πook uhh
my arm
is not numb
anymore‚•πok‚•πdo you know any other sixteen year olds who are vaccinated‚•πno‚•πuhm

it might be awful‚•πi read up to the line on page 4
would you like to hear my thoughts‚•πyes‚•πok so #1
its realistic fiction‚•πit is‚•πwhich i like
um
that said
i have several concerns
so its very i do this then i do that
very action based
i mean
not too much
but
idk
it just‚•πum‚•πidk how to describe that‚•πso what should it be‚•πtheres no
dialogue‚•πok‚•πits too much imagery
i think‚•πok‚•πthen
there is
several grammatical/typo issues‚•πhmm
ok‚•πword missing‚•πi though i fixed them
give examples‚•πim trying to find them‚•πok‚Ä¶‚•πi found about 4‚•πok‚•πbut i dont remember where they are
would you like me to continue searching?‚•πyes‚•πok
idk i found one

not
but‚•πthat is correct
sorry

a past event
but i can change that
it works in both ways‚•πum

the ip address
in north korea‚•πHA
easter egg‚•πlol‚•πthx for noticing that
it was such a minor detail‚•πyw‚•πok what else
yes minor‚•πip addresses in stories
are not
minor
to me‚•πlol
to some people it might be
but go on‚•πi dont have much more to say‚•πplot‚•πplot is
um
thus far
not particularly special‚•πyes
only the ending
is special‚•πit didn't like
grab me that hard
although
since its realistic fiction
it was easier to keep reading it
without falling asleep‚•πah
well if you get to the end
the ending is more special‚•πMaybe ill write some stories‚•πalso it's like the kinda predecessor book
to red is blue
the one with the glass cage
and the singing‚•πyes‚•πyes‚•πyes‚•πif you wanna read more go ahead
later‚•πi might read more later
or write my own story‚•πlol
i recommend
reading it more‚•πok‚•πi want plus feedback‚•πcy wants to make a blog with gatsby
he needs to play with Gatsby more
i could use NetlifyCMS‚•πi needa jacket
one sec‚•πwhy
is it
that cold?‚•πyes‚•πi just opened my window
im too warm‚•πl a g‚•π?

bye‚•πbye
should cy make a poprx system
so like

or 2 lines
of code
on your website

cy is sooooo tempted to not use gatsby
and make his own ssg like ramesh did
cy
is going to use
his own ssg
.
actually cy is still not sure
lol‚•πWhat is the best free video editing software‚•πHitfilm Express
i tried a bunch
hitfilm was like
the most
complete‚•πKk‚•πdavinci resolve‚•πyeah i hear that ones good too
cy is stuck on how to make his blog‚•πramesh is wondering
how he can tell more people that they may be eligible to get vaccinated
even
if they are under 18
i think it is a good idea
Oh god
no cy
ill make my own site
what shouldi i call it tho‚•πvaksine‚•πno
it has to indicate
it is for minors‚•πwhat is the purpose of the site again‚•πto inform young people
that they too
can get vaccinated if they have underlying conditions‚•πok so do this‚•πor are obese‚•πmake a site
and have it have a dropdown
and a check box
and then
based on those selections
it like
says
yes or no‚•πi was thinking‚•πand which vaccines‚•πi go to discord‚•πthey can take‚•πand then
I write a PSA status
then I make my username _xylian
so i appear at the top of the friend list
and then
it tells them‚•πlol‚•πthey can‚•π_____________________________________________________xylian‚•π__xylian
PSA: 16, 17,  and 18 year old high-schoolers ARE eligible for the vaccine if you have health conditions!! Check this link to see if you have these conditions: <CDC guidelines link here>. Get a SHOT! IT IS EASY, FREE, SAFE, AND EFFECTIVE. If you need help getting an appointment, DM me for tips.
i want it
to sound like an ad
intentionally‚•πok‚•πdo you think this works‚•πi suppose
although
i dont think its neccesary
there are ppl who need vaccines more‚•πwhy‚•πthan children‚•πtrue‚•πin virtual school‚•πlol‚•πsee
cy wants‚•πi wont be in virtual school tho‚•πlazy loading
on his blog‚•πturbolinks‚•πum
i meant like
if you have a homepage
with blog posts
they load in as you scroll‚•πthats
annoying‚•πbut what if i have 100 posts‚•πBoris
Yes‚•πi would
paginate
the vaccine givers are smart
they talk to you about something to distract your pain
this is why getting an nj vaccine appointment is so hard
i did what i wanted cy
about the psa about the vaccine
Yeah
I use it a bit‚•πis it fast?‚•πBased on chrome‚•πnow with full contentful support‚•πthis‚•πHOW THE HELL DOES THIS WORK IN INTERNET EXPLORER‚•πlol
bet it no work in firefox‚•πwhoa
i like css compilers
they solve all my compatibility issues
you just design for chrome
and they fix everything
the backdrop filter is missing a media query
but other than that‚•πI told you‚•πtold me what‚•πto use a compiled css
I actually did my work in class for once in my life‚•πthe thing is
its just like
css
not scss
css
actually
wait
only the header bar uses scss‚•πthe teacher is yelling at the student for using powerpoint‚•πthe rest of it is just css‚•πand for once I support the student‚•πlol‚•πthe teacher likes laughing at people to make them feel worse‚•πlol‚•πimagine having any emotional intelligence
wait
wait
wait
wait
what is contentful
whats surge doing then‚•πits a static web host‚•πthen what is contentful doing‚•πloading in the posts
from the CMS
its a CMS‚•πInteresting‚•πhere tell me a post to make
send me a title and a body
and see how fast it appears on the page‚•πLorem ipsum carrots
Hi im cy i like carrots‚•πdone‚•πtf is my right arm hurting for now
ok then‚•πsee contentful is good
and it uses GraphQL
you query it
and it gives you your content
yes
um

that you love carrots‚•πlol‚•πim taking it out of context‚•πimma take that post down
down‚•πi got a screenshot
it's fine
guess im not a person‚•πyes i have not added the media query
that resolves that‚•πcool
how do u study for a retake
where
the mistakes you made were legit
6 - 2 = 2
and you lose 5 points
since it's a multiple choice question‚•πim so curios
how‚•πidfk
i practiced my kumon preschool books‚•πfor extremely large values of 2‚•πlol‚•πit would not equal 2 tho‚•πYES IT WOULD
STOP
IM AN ENGINEER‚•πlim x ‚Üí 4 2‚•πIM RIGHT‚•πah yes round everything up‚•πthere was an urban dictionary word on this
something lik ethis
school seems safe
look it's data‚•πoo data‚•πyes i like the data
it's cool‚•πexactly‚•π0% of 16 year olds are vaccinated‚•π6-2 can never = 2‚•πthis sums up
perfectly‚•πif it even had with large values of 2‚•π*were‚•πah this‚•πSTILL out of stock
DAMN
it's not as bad but MY MY‚•πholy heck‚•πand good look getting a 5900x
still dead stock
impossible to get
this seems‚Ä¶
legit‚•πdoes it?
actually yes its good
i would love a dodeca core cpu‚•πi have one‚•πOoo self hosting paas things
Whats the difference between paas and like saas‚•πpaas is like google app engine
where i can run my flask app‚•πheroku‚•πsaas is like contentful
where they provide the cms
the hosting
the frontend
everything‚•πHuh‚•πum
wdym by that‚•πlike‚•πeaten indoors‚•πgone to a restaurant during the covid-19
pandemic
inside
and eaten‚•πi have not gone to a restaurant during COVID 19‚•πoh‚•πnot indoors‚•πok i think the school is trying to start being lgbtq+/ try to be inclusive
which i dont hate
but i say this because 4/8 fiction books for summer reading focus around the idea of lgbtq
and the nonfiction ones are around systemic racism and sociology‚•πI see‚•πI'm not necessarily opposed to it but it cannot be one-sided
Otherwise I won't like it‚•πmy mom got a book in her mailbox at rutgers
about why climate change is a hoax‚•π..
not that‚•πTrumpism‚•πhaha
‚Ä¶
idk
"trumpetism"‚•πyes‚•πi want food
This webpage is interesting
I like its design
The US government knows how to make websites it seems‚•πyea its not bad‚•πbtw ramesh
has proper use of serif fonts
if you like serif fonts‚•πits not bad‚•πSo what I have concluded is that vaccinated people who are dining indoors are being selfish
It will not affect them
But it will affect others
Thus I will probably not do this‚•πcause u could carry it?‚•πyou can
the thing is
apparently vaccination will make you less prone to spreading it
but that is not proven yet‚•πah fck
i have to listen to fire alarms ringing‚•πüëè
your parents are cooking?‚•πnope‚•πthen why are they ringing‚•πuhh?‚•πhmm?
oh uh fire department inspectors are here‚•πoh
nice
the inspectors will probably come for us like next week‚•πremember that time when the fire ppl had to come to my house
cuz we pressed the "test" button on the CO alarm‚•πah that was funny
but they usually dont call the fire department do they?‚•πlol no akhil
as we learned‚•πours doesn't‚•πthe hard way‚•πours dont
they ring all the time
no one ever comes‚•πno we have ones from ADT security
those ring‚•πthats why‚•πyeah‚•πI wonder if there will be vaccinated-only restaurants‚•πnah
mabye the fancy ones‚•πik my brother will want to go‚•πif u wanna go find a resturant that allows dine in‚•πtwo weeks after his second dose
i mean you could also take out
and then
go to the park
that would be pretty safe imo
you could probably do it without getting vaccinated‚•πi not only have 1 or 2
but 6 new garbanzos for u‚•πoh HECK yes‚•πill send em as i finish them‚•πMy thanks to you‚•πhaha
i cant wait
to see what they r‚•πyes
also i might be busy for a bit since i have to do some more physics studying because idk how to do 6-2‚•πof course
study some kumon books‚•πdid the school wifi go down or something?‚•πum
I left school‚•πI know
I was wondering if you knew a person who knew a person‚•πno‚•πmy arm hurts less now‚•π?‚•πIdk

thats not the insult i meant
actually
you leave after the attendance
yeah‚•πOurs let us go‚•πoh‚•πLike the entire class left‚•πours did not
they said go into groups and i went into the group myself and i had to have that awkward talk with the teacher
hi

when I did git pull

from DM to Oxygen‚•πlol‚•πAren‚Äôt they already?‚•πNo‚•πHuh i remember this was a discussion like 2 years ago or something
Thought it also got applied‚•πno

Ik theres this thing
Called rhe china virus
Not applicable in the us tho‚•πoh i heard about that on the news
of course‚•πYeah i was watching fox last night‚•πyes‚•πMan‚•πfox is the best‚•πThe media is just lying to us‚•πthey always have such good news coverage‚•πExcwpt fox
Yeah ikr
It's so objective‚•πthey present it as it is‚•πEXACTLY
And the biased libtard media like the new york times
Just makes up nonzense‚•πthe damn democrats‚•πIkr‚•πgoing around and messing with everything‚•πLegit like
Even some republicans
Arent strong enough to fight for what we believe in
Like mike pence‚•πthat damn mcconnell‚•πmike pence‚•πHe let us down man‚•πhes like
a traitor‚•πIkr
Hes not a patriot‚•πhang mike pence‚•πyes
justice
must be served‚•πDems will cancel you if you say it
U know that big tech works for the libs‚•πtrue‚•πwe have to break them up
they are censoring us
and turning america into 1984‚•πwhat has this country turned into‚•πikr
immigrants are coming in‚•πwhat is this china?‚•πand my christian heritage
my faith in Jesus Christ
I love those things‚•πno its GODDAMN US OF FCKING A‚•πI know right
it has
AMERICA
AMERICA IS FOR AMERICANS‚•πNOT THE IMMIGRANTS
GET UR OWN COUNTRY‚•πikr‚•πsomeones gotta stop them taking our damn jobs‚•πhonestly black lives matter is a hoax‚•πalong with climate change‚•πlegit like just this libtard
"movement"
it's also racist‚•πits all a ploy‚•πsince white lives matter too
plandemic anyone?‚•πyes‚•πthe deep state just wanted to insert microchips in us
that's why this happened‚•πimmigrants brought it the virus in‚•πno way in HELL im getting those vaccines‚•πthe government allowed immigration
they knew this would happen‚•πyes if you don't know
Q said they are part of the deep state‚•πwhy would u get vaccines ever?‚•πikr
they cause autism‚•πexactly‚•πand now microchips
so now they can control your lives
brainwash you
into becoming a libral‚•πthose damn liberals
we gotta fight‚•πno
it's not
liberals
nestle
nestle runs the world‚•πyes‚•πthey secretly
control everyone
and the librals
are on their side
no one knows this‚•πthey r the librals‚•πthe ducks in the park are free
they don't tell you this‚•πnestle = librals‚•πi have 473 ducks
what the media doesn't tell you‚•πthe media is controlled by librals‚•πyou heard how people just die after getting vaccinated‚•πso it makes sense‚•πcept fox
fox is really high quailty stuff‚•πlol funny
that was like
the book‚•πthey r on our side‚•πmy mom
got in her mailbox
at rutgers
and she was like‚•πit's true
they are trying to bring you out of the deep state
either that, or just delete this entire conversation‚•πit came with a dvd‚•πi dont want someone in 10 years to take this out of context
and be like‚•πhaha‚•π"ramesh is a qanon supporter"‚•πlol‚•πdelete it all
here
to this message‚•πthats alot of messages cys gotta delete‚•πwe cant delete it
since hes an admin‚•πyea cy has to‚•πi realized that good screwmanship can have sexual connotations‚•πlol
so should we not say it‚•πscrewmanship?‚•πscrew man ship‚•πok i may just be really out of it but i dont understand‚•πok well
to screw means to copulate
so by saying you have good screwmanship
you are saying you are good at copulating with people
something like that‚•πyea but screwmanship is not a word‚•πit is not
it is a cy word
he uses it to describe himself‚•πhuh
this makes sense now
I cannot do apush

In a minute‚•πnot yet‚•πI have to turn on my computer‚•πnot really anyway‚•πAt all?‚•πwe havent seen moash/kaladin for a while
aka interludes and shallan‚•πah
i have no storming clue where you are
wheres shallan at‚•πHmm?
uh she kills Tyn‚•πmy favourite
scene
in the book
how does she kill tyn?‚•πand then arranges a meeting with the people who hired her
with a silver(i think) blade‚•πgit = version control system

code
you commit code 
committing code means that you basically "save" it as a revision

branches are kinda like different versions of code (and commits happen for the branch that you are working on)
like you might have a stable branch for stable changes, a dev branch for active dev changes, and a feature branch for some additional features 

you can merge branches together, so you could go like feature ‚Üí dev ‚Üí stable

for you, you could have a "cy" and a "calum" branch and
silver?‚•πas in color‚•πread the scene again akhil
just go
read it
again‚•πnot substance‚•πgo read it
ur missing the point
when does mist twist akhil‚•π?
when there is water
that forms a mist‚•πin the stormlight archive akhil
maybe you go read the prologue to the way of kings again‚•πits usually said when like a blade appears or vanish‚•πwhat kind of blade‚•π...
a shardblade
what else‚•πyes
did you miss that‚•πnot at all‚•πhaha
how tf does shallan have a shardblade
this is why my favourite scene is this‚•πyea its pretty cool‚•πit comes from absolutely nowhere and hits you like a brick
someone remind me I have my scheduling thing tomorrow‚•πU have ur scheduling thing tmrw, yes u ramesh‚•πcalum like
disappeared
like he was editing the app
while screensharing
and then
out of nowhere
the screenshare terminates
and hes offline on discord‚•πhis power maybe
went out‚•πhes on a laptop‚•πthe internet‚•πtrue‚•πat least me
but i dont have my xylian account on
my phone‚•πthat's weird that his power went out‚•πimma join this‚•πok‚•πin some minutes mabye‚•πok‚•πwhat should I make
right
i was making the yew app
btw akhil yew is confusing‚•πYea i looked at some documentation
It was weird
Idk imma work on my website‚•πyou cant just render a component‚•πThats weird‚•πill ask in their discord
YouTube changed their icons
nvm I think
I figured out how to do it
ML time?
i dont feel like learning yew
seed is nice
time to write an emotes API client
either that or I do my apush notes‚•πI just finished apush‚•πim feeling lazy
idk whether to join this devil's quill discord

fiction books
non realistic fiction
some realistic fictions are good
but i dont like them that much
I just finished one‚•πthey r fine‚•πalso I just feel like of the discrimination stuff we hear about
no one does it in our community
because we are all rich and whatever
and no one is really racist
so it is very hard to relate‚•πwell racist against each other yea no‚•πI believe I already read this
my friend said malcom gladwell is racist‚•πi think i did back in like 7th grade‚•πAnd I think
he is right‚•πwe had this really wack teacher‚•πin some ways‚•π*cough
Why so many‚•πill put female
no goddamn it i wish there was an airplane
option
or an other option
and ill be like‚•πOther: ATTACK HELICOPTER‚•π"idiots assume my gender but it is AIRPLANE"
TRUE

WHY ARE THEY ASKING THIS
ITS NOT LIKE THEY CANT JUST GO TO GENESIS AND SEE I AM MALE‚•πWhat its it for?‚•πidk

and they were like
flying around
all around us
under chairs
over tables

I wanna build one of those little tiny ones
that you can fly indoors‚•πUh some batterys have firmwares and small computers
Yes that was cool‚•πI finished my apush notes‚•πnice

what i would have
is server side analytics

do that‚•πbut that costs money$
idk why
so you use client side analytics‚•πfine
stop using google analytics though‚•πGatsby recommended it‚•π*sigh

it's fine tho
i have ublock origin‚•πthe thing is like
most browsers block it

i have 473 sign in systems.‚•πlol

what time is 2nd period?‚•πur late
by 4 minutes‚•πnice‚•πyou mean 16‚•πno pretty sure its 17
sno- is 18‚•π6+5+6 = 17
but its +
so you -1
so 16‚•πim fckin stupid
i forgot sno is 17
welp thats like 5 points gone
eh‚•πit asked you to draw 2 resonance structures?‚•π3‚•πi have one‚•πN is the central‚•πwhy?‚•πcause thats what he told us to do‚•πbut s is the biggest‚•πidk the question says N is the center‚•πhuh‚•πidk i think ill be fine
he prob will give me partial credit
other than that and like some other thing its fine
yea i did that last one
yea thats what i put
so i should be fine‚•πand then 3 on the O?‚•πyea‚•πbut O cant do that can it?
i guess it can‚•πit prob can‚•πok
was it like
screen locked
so you had to have 2 computers‚•πYes
Well kinda
I just had a vsper chart on my second monitor
I need a jump rope now‚•πI think im gonna do the test on my laptop

just use HTML
its less load on the brain
and more focused
on the design‚•πWell its gonna be interactive i think‚•πhow much tho‚•πNot too much‚•πGatsby is more for larger projects
i wouldnt burden yourself with it for something like this‚•πWell il try
Idk how imma do that left side text‚•πi mean
i can design that‚•πBecause its not only sideways‚•πik how to‚•πBut i made them taller as well‚•πby "ik how to" i mean i dont
but if i like
tried and failed
rapidly
i would get it‚•πU could prob get it
Yea‚•πwithin an hour or so‚•πThe question is how to make the text taller‚•πwdym‚•πIg if i were to say how i did it in photoshop

so essentially‚•πpern√¨a‚•πtell me‚•πreddit disliked it‚•πHer husband is a pedo not her but she supports it‚•πso she endorses it
yea so a bunch of subreddits became private
temporarily‚•πyes except
he blocks your screen
so you have to do it on another computer‚•πuse hardcopies‚•πwhy?‚•πprotesting essentially‚•πYeah just print one‚•πi guess il just print one‚•πso‚•πimma have to do that when im back in school‚•πthey were protecting her?‚•πThe Reddit thing makes you question the backgrounds of the rest of the admins
Like clearly they don‚Äôt do background tests‚•πreddit the company was protecting her‚•πok
why‚•πreddit the community was not‚•πDozing
Doxing‚•πthe really concerning part is like
this person is my brother's age

old was she
when she ran for something in the uk
since she is 23
rn‚•πbecause they posted her support for pedophilia or something in r/ukpolitics‚•π‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

to an http request‚•πoh nice‚•πso what this means
is you can easily host a file
from your web browser
but
you can download it
and use it anywhere
like a regular http file
like
there is a server
that translates the incoming data from websocket
into an http response
which is cool
also i might write my own proxy system
to bypass the school firewall
once and for all‚•πNice

I do weird things with the chat history dataset‚•πis ramesh coming to apcs‚•πYes
Dont go to sleep at 2‚•πNice one‚•πlol at least not on a week night
i do that on weekends‚•πcy
you dont
know
the data was really cool‚•π?
the data‚•πwait

wait‚•πok...‚•πit's sus
btw do you want a copy of among us‚•πno‚•πlol‚•πthat must be
really really relevant
Bright Lifestyle‚•πquelques partes de les donn√©es est en fran√ßais‚•πcdknight: some of the dataset data is in French‚•πsonts‚•πlol
de les
is that right‚•πsome parts of the dataset is in french‚•πLol
i mean some bad enlgish speakers would do that‚•πwho is someone
is it me‚•πwhat
where‚•πdo not open hexedit on your numworks
it like
causes a fault
resets‚•πhow did you
open hexedit‚•πby installing it
from the omega apps thing‚•πlol
why‚•πidk i installed all the apps‚•πyea ik
it just crashes‚•πI need to regex the message strings‚•πi need
an sd card
and ideally an hdmi to wii converter thing
i want to use my wii‚•πooo someone saw my issue
that i raised‚•πI actually
did do the same thing‚•πhow to you use those game simulators on the numworks‚•πask akhil‚•πhola‚•πhow to you use those game simulators on the numworks‚•πcy
no not cy
akhil
tell him how to
you have to do something with the omega app installer‚•πoh yea i was in class
so essentially
when u install the apps
there is a choice to install like files or add them
so u just add a rom file
then install it‚•πum
i didn't see that
hmm‚•πwhere u install the apps‚•πok‚•πthat unofficial repo‚•πok‚•πu have to be careful tho to make sure its not a large file
otherwise the installer kinda throws an error at you‚•πnot quite sure how i got that picture‚•πum
its a picture
of the camera‚•πyes‚•πbut its broken‚•πin pieces‚•πso how did u take the picture‚•πidk‚•πit may be a different camera‚•πno that picture‚•πalso it has gps?‚•πyes‚•πintresting
idk what u would need it
except metadata‚•πto geotag
yes
geotagging is really nice‚•πits not bad
idk if the dslr does it‚•πi got the camera for free‚•πit does have a fancy thing‚•πfrom the woman
down the street‚•πwhere it adds the aperature of the lens it uses and the settings taken on it
nice‚•πmy dads dslr does geotagging
i think‚•πi think mine does it as well
but it uses my phone‚•πi have a Nikon that does the geotagging itself‚•πi also have a nikon
so ig it does it itself‚•πwell it has to have GPS
^^ that nikon‚•πthis is an offtopic thing
but it's just me right
I just
i hate this kaomoji ‚Üí ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø‚•πlol‚•πJust u‚•πlol‚•πtbh‚•πit makes me feel uncomfortable‚•πi kinda dont like it either‚•πI dont mind it at all‚•πit feels really like
passive-aggressive‚•πi just thing is like
weird
im weird‚•πIt's like
a more aggressive way to say idc
like "I really don't care, **ck off"‚•πWell isnt it idk‚•πno
i read it as‚•πok could someone here please give me their opinion of the styling‚•πthis
Meh‚•πand tell me why‚•πthis drop shadow
is awful‚•πhow could it be better‚•πnot having a drop shadow that is as
black
and maybe more "spread" out
like it extends further‚•πi see
what do you think of no drop shadow‚•πremove it
im lazy‚•πwell see heres the thing
calum wants no drop shadows‚•πyes‚•πbut that looks like it came straight out of 2013‚•πyeah
im with him
no
the drop shadows
look like 2013‚•π2013 was the year of flatness‚•πno drop shadows is the way
flat is good‚•π"flat is justice"‚•πsee heres the issue
design trends
are not flat
right now
they are going
anti flat
flat looks old
in fact‚•πi kinda want a like‚•πpeople are sort of like‚•πwindows 95 look
ngl‚•πgoing back to a sort of‚•πno like‚•πpseudo-skeumorphism‚•πexactly windows 95
i want to make my desktop look like that‚•πthat would look cool
as heck
its a matter of what u prefer‚•πeven windows 95 has drop shadows‚•πi like minimalism and flat‚•πbut if its gonna be flat
then the color scheme needs to change‚•πI like‚•πthe thing is like
if you want everything one color
white
or a specific shade of green
you have to have some way of defining boundaries
which is done with drop shadows
if you dont want them
you either use borders
which dont look good on mobile
or you use a different color scheme
that permits you to define borders without shadows
I need more feedback on this‚•πi told you
i like the rest‚•πwhat do you like in particular‚•πthe logo
the boxes
the font is fine
i just
really dislike the drop shadow on the menu
it looks really out of place‚•πand what did you suggest‚•πthis
looks really fluid
and consistent
and I really
like it‚•πyou know the cards also have a drop shadow‚•πalso remove this
they are
barely visible
so it's fine‚•πput it in light mode
that's the mode ppl will see it in‚•πstil
remove the drop shadows in light mode too‚•πhmm‚•πalso this looks nicer
than
putting it in the center
or maybe put it in the center
and make the title larger‚•πok that was calums idea‚•π2em‚•πto make it small
and in the center
i actually‚•πbad‚•πwanted it to be like‚•πdont listen to calum‚•πin a box
so like
hold on‚•πno‚•πLike this
But with a thin line after the title
Like markdowns ‚Äî-‚•πyeah
thats good‚•πthis is how i had it originally‚•πit's better
but I prefer akhil's‚•πthe problem is like
the title of the post
and the heading
of the content
idk
i still have to work out the whole thing with posts‚•πDont have the title and the heading be the same size‚•πthe thing is this‚•πi gtg‚•πthe post‚•πu guys keep discussing‚•πbye‚•πAdios‚•πthe post
has
2 fields
title
and content
and the content
can contain headers‚•πokay‚•πso i wanted to separate out the post title
but
idk‚•πyea so have the title be larger than headers
right align and have a thin line after it‚•πBut the title might be really long
right align?‚•πi meant left
left align‚•πyeah definately not center‚•πa title should not be long‚•πbut its not neccesarily the post title
it can be like
the post "name"‚•πyea the name should not be long‚•πlike here
Welcome to the 4H Fair App
is content
and its more important
than the post name
which is welcome‚•πthen u should not have a post name
the most important should be at the top
and largest
thats just how it has to be‚•πhuh
ok‚•πit doesnt look right to go small, large then back to small again
it should taper
large, medium, small‚•πi see
ok now what about the colors
and the shadows
and all that‚•πcolors r fine
idk bout shadows
some are okay‚•πsee i was the other way
i was like
the shadows are good
but the colors
are bad‚•πwell i mean what colors would you want to put?‚•πwell the main thing is like
the header bar is green
i would normally make it white or black‚•πyea that works‚•πbased on the theme
but this is 4h
so we wanna make it green‚•πyea leave it green‚•πbut then that makes everything 5x more difficult
because‚•πhow so‚•πlike
if green is your accent
you cant put green
on green
your accent in the header bar has to be white or black‚•πyea so have it be white on light mode
and black on dark mode‚•πi mean that's what we have now‚•πyea thats fine‚•πthis is what we had before‚•πyea what u have now is fine
there is another thing
but its kinda small
and only on dark mode
which is the post color and the background color are a bit too similar
they post color should be a bit of a lighter grey
so it stands out from the black
but that just might be my monitor‚•πor should the background just be black‚•πnever have the background be just black
that honestly looks awful‚•πi mean here it does‚•πdarker greys‚•πidk‚•πmake things look a lot nicer‚•πoff-black is a bit weird‚•πi avoid black as much as possible‚•πespecially on cheaper monitors‚•πits way too harsh‚•πlike when i have a white background
and black text‚•πthat works‚•πi prefer not black
like‚•πbut the inverse does not‚•πthis is not black text‚•πits a bit of a greyish
dark grey‚•πput it in dark theme
theres an option at the bottom‚•πidk i find that a bit harsh‚•πit must be me
i like harsh things‚•πi dislike this the most
the apple webpages are bad
the black ones anyway
i liked the white with grey accents‚•πsee what i dont like is when ppl call something a "dark theme"
and its like
light gray‚•πlight gray is ehh
i prefer dark grey
discord is an example‚•πdiscord's theme is not too bad
its not a dark theme really
their light theme is bold
i like it‚•πyea its not a dark theme but its good‚•πbut the thing about their "dark" theme
is like
its a bit unique
cuz its not entirely gray
its sort of
purpley
its not actually gray
its like
very very mildly blue‚•πYea
But it fits the aesthetic‚•πit does
but also
it gives them room
to go lighter
and darker‚•πExactly‚•πthat was the one problem with my black theme sites
i couldnt go darker
which i didn't need to most of the time
but
sometimes it would have been nice
like to have a drop shadow
or something
when you go black though
then drop shadows are not needed anymore
calums list of gross things‚•πHow
Does he hate
Pale colors‚•πhe likes
everything‚•πPastel/pale colors are nice‚•πgray and vivid blue
with no variability
no shadow
no color
no themes‚•πWhy would u go vivid blue‚•πnothing‚•πWith grey
Go pastel blue
With grey
That looks awesome‚•πpastel blue‚•πAlso serif is fine if its used properly
Thats a pastel blue
Idk what that is‚•πthis is what he things of serif fonts:‚•πOh god
That quality‚•πsee there are different styles
vercel uses a flat with outlies design
which i consider modern‚•πWhich is nice
Yes‚•πthen there are designs with drop shadows‚•πMinimalism is the best
Nothing fancy‚•πwhite and drop shadows
which is
a little dated
but
still modern
then theres pseudo-skeumorphism
which is the new trend‚•πIf done correct
Um
Correct me if i am wrong but that means is just using like real images almost‚•πpseudo
fake‚•πThe actual counterpart to the design
I mean just normal skeuomorphism‚•πyes
but this new
sort of
thing
its like
material design
but
less flat
and less materialy
its like
interesting
idk‚•πIts off center
Which is pissing me off‚•πits Art‚•πWhy could i not have just stood in the center
And taken the picture‚•πlol‚•πGranted there has like a million people there but still‚•πwere‚•πSame with this one
Why do i shoot pictures
Off center
I also didnt hide the desk well at all‚•πHi im Intel
i will now manufacture arm chips
im that desperate
please
help me
im so desperate im even asking TSMC
to help me
omg this is the funniest thing‚•πYay‚•πroket‚•π*rokit‚•πlol;‚•πim sorry go back to school
you need to learn
to spel‚•πit was like joke spell‚•πjeppy is also good at joke speling
he has very good gramer‚•πwho is jeppy‚•πJP‚•πjp‚•πfrom 4h‚•πooooooooooooo
brain‚•πcy is now accepting POST requests‚•πwhat
you wrote
your own
http server‚•πlol yes‚•πwhat language‚•πpython‚•πand also does it have a byte limit
like‚•πbut imma probably rewrite it
in like‚•πhow many bytes do you read from the tcp stream‚•πgo or something‚•πthis‚•π102400 rn‚•πLol‚•πbut‚•πto me‚•πit will become infinite‚•πi really want to know
how to make it infinitie
how do you know
when to stop
do you know‚•πim working on it
this is a special http server
that will allow a browser
to fulfill a get request
by sending a POST request
i think i already outlined this‚•πthats a bit
confusing‚•πthe idea is
it acts as a relay
and
it will send a message to a web client
via websocket or something
and then the client
will POST to the relay
the data it wishes to send as a response
and that will be relayed to the user
btw i also wrote a websocket server
from scratch
so i might use that
although websockets are a bit annoying to deal with from scratch‚•πim not too sure
im dealing with discord rn‚•πok
im listening to a French song
from our French Manie Musicale
that i liked‚•πim listening to a japanese music soundtrack
it's mostly classical
"classical"
aka
not lyrical
it's not electronic‚•πyesterday i got an http request to be answered through websocket
but
it was like
bad
and complicated
i have an image
it is 29 KB
then
i have the same image
and its 44 KB
its time to figure out where it becomes this big
first it is on my pc
then i select it
in the browser
then it is read by a FileReader
then it is POSTed to the server
then it is received by another browser
then it is downloaded‚•πliterally gnome animations are macos‚•πfrom that browser
i have a feeling its this step
because the js prints out the file
on the screen
and it says 44.6 KB‚•πim making the rcsc sign in system rn
do you know how it will work
any idea‚•πum
it wont‚•πi totally understand‚•πbecause we're at home‚•πnext year‚•πi will have to search through my photos for a barcode‚•πno
that is scrapped
it will not be doing that‚•πok then
um
idk
i mean
i think i already postulated my ideas‚•πit will use a pi as a wifi ap‚•πoh no‚•πlol‚•πand then what?‚•πgoogle oauth
as a captive portal
and then‚•πso every time‚•πit restricts the wifi range‚•πi enter the comp sci room
i have to‚•πyes‚•πswitch my wifi network‚•π:D‚•πand lose connection‚•πfor a few seconds‚•πthen go through a captive portal‚•πyes‚•πthen disconnect again
and reconnect to the main network‚•πtell me how to implement security
without this‚•πum
im not sure how like
if you gave me a moment to think
i could probably find
a much
much‚•πi spent an excessive amount of time‚•πbetter way‚•πthinking about this
ok you do your thing
im making this
becuase I want to‚•πi mean‚•πeveryone keeps telling me that what im doing is a waste of time so it's not like it makes a difference
everyone = more than you‚•πi mean
im not saying the learning is a waste of time
but like
i dont think that's a good solution
to sign in
a better solution
is just
check the ip of the requests
and if they come from BTSD
then they're good
if you want more
add a qr code in the classroom
and google sign in‚•πNo
Because
Someone in BTSD
Not at RCSC can sign in
And that is a problem‚•πbut they need a qr code‚•πNo‚•πwhich is at btsd‚•πI can
Send my friend
The QR code‚•πbut they are on the bus
going home
they are no longer at BTSD‚•πNo
I can
Sign in on behalf of them‚•πyou need their google account‚•πAlso
That requires hosting‚•πyes‚•πAnd im not hosting anything online‚•πwhy‚•πThis one requires no public hosting
It is cheap and maintainable‚•πso is serverless‚•πIm not interested in this‚•πidk i think like
it would be faster
and more secure
for someone
to just
take attendance‚•πIdc‚•πok then
go do that
alternatively if you're being really cool
and want a hardware solution
with no hosting
use the Bluetooth tracking ids
that come from ppls phones‚•πNo
Then
I have to write an app‚•πno‚•πPwas‚•πthey are already being broadcast‚•πWhat
Tell me about this‚•πlike for that coronavirus app‚•πOk...‚•πi believe the phone is listening/broadcasting
with a mac address/unique id‚•πHmm‚•πthat you can ping for‚•πOk this is good‚•πik iphones are explicitly listening‚•πAndroid?‚•πnot android tho
they dont scan continuously‚•πis there like
some documentation for this
imma look into it‚•πi am purely speculating
it may require an app
or you could just have ppl install COVID ALERT NJ‚•πlol
no
if it requires an app
then it is not possible
the wifi ap is an extra layer of security
and i can have the password change each week
since android has that qr code wifi thing‚•πwdym android
only samsung
or oneplus‚•πno
android has it‚•πto read them tho
iPhone and android
can do it‚•πThis
alternatively
i can use webrtc
somehow
ok no‚•πwebrtc?
no‚•πyeah
I agree‚•πthat requires hosting‚•πno
it's p2p
right‚•πbut it still requires hosting‚•πwhy‚•πfor the signaling layer‚•πnvm then
no
Pi‚•πpi indeed
cy might figure this out with an ESP32
but first hes actually kinda interested in that Bluetooth thing
he just has to find a third jumper wire‚•πYeah i am too‚•πso he can serial into his pi‚•π√áa
Ramesh for once did not fail a Physics thing‚•πyeah uh
idk
about
the Bluetooth thing
devices have to be listening
and discoverable‚•πi gave up on nixos‚•πi believe Telegram uses rlottie for its fancy animations
are rendered by a wasm compiled version of rlottie
hi my name is samsung
i name an animation renderer
rlottie‚•πim still dealing with this idiotic nixos thing
i have concluded
that running nixos on a raspberry pi 4 is impossible
i will now try a pi 3‚•πwhy‚•πbecause
and next time imma buy something that works‚•πbecause?‚•πbecause
The end‚•πlol ramesh and his explanations
you know what i need an explanation for‚•πLol RCSC Meeting Reminder
whatever
what
the fork‚•πwhy does telegram own a virtual ISP
on that island‚•πoh
since durov like has a citizenship there right
near that island‚•πhuh
im looking up ips
is hosted on
Google Cloud
im like what
how
whats weird tho is like
its all the way in kansas
google doesn't care about speed clearly
is hosted on
Akamai
um‚•πI need a new google voice notification number‚•πgimme a site
i want a site
that's not on cloudflare
that i can look up‚•πum
yes
ik
or‚•πLinode
ramesh‚•πwait
i think
that is on cf
yeah
ok dont do that‚•πthat one was a bit more complicated‚•πhmmmmm‚•πVercel‚•πew‚•πlol
data cynters
vercel is hosted on Amazon
bad
lol so does netlify
not Surge tho
they're on Digital Ocean
lol
they host themselves
on their own isp‚•πgood
yeah since
they are an isp
lol‚•πbut now i know why surge a little slower
they are all the way
in California‚•πok how about like‚•πlol they are hosted by the Chinese Communist Party
on nginx‚•πhmm
thats taking a while
i see‚•πyeah its really slow
Ryugyong-dong
is their ISP‚•πwhat is that‚•πin north korea‚•πhaha
now we are getting into Very Evil Territory‚Ñ¢
China is evil‚•πlol‚•πand then theres north korea
where
china is considered
freedom‚•πlol‚•πyes‚•πlol i just realized
the screen
is falling out
of my iPod touch
the battery swelled that much
like if i turn it on
i can see light through the gap
in the side of it
How to do screen replacements 101
wait for the battery to swell so much
the screen falls out on its own‚•πim starting the wifi ap stuff now
finally
that took‚•πin south korea
those 2 have such similar names
dont they get along?‚•πthey dont
north korea‚•πlol‚•πcalls itself
Ï°∞ÏÑ†Íµ≠‚•πYes‚•πand south korea

try like
wgetting that‚•πthat's like
what cyserv  relay returns
cyserv relay has tried to send images
but it always fails
it something to do with string encoding
idk what tho
cuz its not supposed to encode or decode anything

look at the page‚•πlol
interesting‚•πwho is
alex strasser‚•πmade the app

i think
btw
when cyserv-r is done
you will be able to use it
to send files on Discord‚•πi mean
how‚•πwdym‚•πi can use
any web server
for that‚•πits not a web server tho
so if you have a really big file
it doesn't have to upload first‚•πso like
IPFS‚•πyeah‚•πbut less stupid‚•πbut with a relay‚•πyeah
ok i see‚•πipfs is not stupid
its just
complex‚•πive been going at this since 3‚•πyou know what cy hasn't done‚•πI have calculated the proper throat and chamber diameter for my rocket engine‚•πI see
on paper?‚•πyuh‚•πum‚•πthis is one part‚•πuse a komputer‚•πmah
nah
cuz like
its esier to b orgonised
and the math was not hard‚•πyeah then i guess its better‚•πit was the consistant guessing and check‚•πbut like then you can make a parametric system
where you just put stuff in
and a throat and chamber diameter come out‚•πggrjklsgajkljkfjkl'gf
why did I spend so much time on this

Futura is a font
Tablet
ü§î something was deleted
and matt deleted it
i see you typing‚•πTelegram is broken it always says I have been @‚Äòed
So I tried @‚Äòing myself to fix it
It did not work‚•πhi im ryan lee
i steal code‚•πcy is going to buy an FPV drone
and a transmitter
and goggles‚•πooooooo
aren't those like
hard to fly
and do the big crash‚•πyup
im getting a little one tho
its called a Whoop
well
whoops are like really tiny
this one is a little bigger
and it uses brushless motors
so its a power whoop‚•πyea, ive heard of those they are sometimes called mini whoops right‚•πyeah
theyre like those toy drones‚•πyuh‚•πI wanna build one‚•πbut with fpv
except
this one
has brushless motors‚•πwait‚•πfor High power
and flying outdoors‚•πhow that able to supply enough voltage‚•πtheyre like‚•πto brushless motor‚•πreallly tiny brushless motors
also it can run on either 1s or 2s‚•πyuh but still ur gonna need like a small lipo‚•πyeah
it uses a small lipo‚•πok
so then it like bigger then a mini whoop‚•πi need goggles tho
yeah‚•πooooo
what about‚•πa little
like‚•πthe dji ones‚•πnooooo
too xpensive‚•πbut cool‚•πidk theres DJI FPV‚•πthere is‚•πbut its $1400‚•πyuh‚•πand everybody hates it‚•πwait
why do ppl hate it‚•πcuz like
its kinda like
a middle ground
between an expensive photography drone
and a racing drone
but like
its kinda the worst of both worlds‚•πrip‚•πits not bad like
if you just wanna do like‚•πcuz what I saw about the dji ones‚•πfast cinematic fpv‚•πwas that they were rly easy to use and integrate into drone‚•πyeah
wait
wait
you mean the dji like
stuff you put on your own quad
or the full on DJI FPV drone‚•πno like stuff u put on quad‚•πoh those‚•πalso I gtg cuz perod end‚•πlike their digital transmission systems‚•πperiod‚•πok
DJI is still too expensive
im looking for a full package (drone, tx, goggles) for less than $200‚•πha
that is like impossable‚•πits not
well
i mean
i think my full price is gonna end up being around $225
+tax
the drone is $95
with batteries
and a charger‚•πact here is one for less
nvm‚•πthing is like
i want good stuff
so im not getting a bundle
im buying each thing individually‚•πbruhh
that means more monee‚•πm AAAAAHHHHHH
im getting a Mobula 7‚•πthat is a week ass drone‚•πLiteRadio 2 SE‚•πnot the mobula‚•πand some goggles‚•πbut the one I sen
t‚•πyeah
um‚•πcyyyyyy
its weaker then the one I sent‚•πapparently really good controller for the price
like
this is the cheapest controller out there
but its not bad
and it charges via USB-C‚•πive seen that‚•πsomehow
and it works as a game controller
for flight sim‚•πbruhh
that means
that it dosent work off of rf
and is super week‚•πno its like
really powerful
100mw
on the SE version‚•πbruhhhh‚•πppl say it has really good range
like
the old one
with 80mw
had really good range
it runs a special version of OpenTX
that you can configure
that's how they cut the costs
they remove the screen and all that complexity
and just put it on the computer
so you plug it in to configure it‚•πwait but how do they pair the open tx softwhere with the drone fc‚•πyou press the bind button
on the controller
theres like‚•πhuh‚•πa binding procedure‚•πwait
then ur gonna hav to buy a separate reciver‚•πit works with FrSky, Futaba, and Bayang‚•πor that comes with the drone‚•πno so im buying the drone‚•πthat has dmr communcations protocal‚•πwith no transmitter
just batteries
and a charger
then
i buy the tx
then i buy the goggles‚•πu need a tx with dmr protocall‚•πdmr?
its FrSky‚•πdigital microwave raido‚•πum
they are all that
its just the modulation protocol
most things are FrSky‚•πdoes it have a video transmitter already?‚•πno so
that's separate
the drone has a video tx
which is just the standard analog
and you pick it up on goggles‚•πyea ik‚•πwait so what was your question‚•πwhat tx are you buying‚•πim not, for the video
the drone is prebuilt
it comes with one
preinstalled‚•π?‚•πno that's for the sticks
like the controls‚•πyea so just a controller one‚•πi have to buy a controller
and goggles
i think the terminology is like
tx/rx
and vtx/goggles‚•πyea u prob can get cheap goggles and stuff‚•πim having trouble finding good cheap goggles
theres the ones from betafpv
but some guy said they were bad
but theyre the only ones around $50 with diversity and dvr‚•πu can always upgrade‚•πyeah but like
i dont wanna spend much money‚•πfor now u can get cheap ones and upgrade them later‚•πhe said they had like
latency
and im like
that's not good for a beginner
but imma go see more reviews
to validate his claims‚•πyea
im trying to build like a photography drone
but it expensive‚•πyeah...
and if it crashes...
tbh
if you want photography
just get a DJI
they are awesome for photography
and reliable
and all that
they're not fun to fly‚•πyea‚•πbut they take real good pictures
and they dont fall out of the sky
unless you are michael
by not fun i mean easy, but not amusing‚•πyea‚•πPut a 360 cam on the drone u make‚•πakhils or mine‚•πEither‚•πmine is a bit small to take anything‚•πImagine putting that vid in vr‚•πlol yes
ill get a 5 inch at some point
like ill build one
and ill put a 360 cam on it‚•πYea thats nice
Also mavic air 2 is 800$
Why‚•πthe whoops are too small to take anything
lol
xpensive
but less xpensive‚•πYea a 5 or 6 should be fine‚•πthan your own drone‚•πWell fpv is like 200‚•πnot a nice photography one‚•πYea
It has a ehh camera‚•πhave you flown a drone akhil
like either a dji
or an fpv
other than our drone project one‚•πNot a dji or an fpv
Ive flown drones tho
Just like cheapo ones‚•πlike those toy ones
from Brookstone‚•πYea‚•πyou can try my DJI
you will see why its really nice
and why its hard to beat that
with a self-built‚•πYea
Dji mini 2 is 500$‚•πyeah
the thing is this
i would not buy a drone for photography
unless
you have lots of places to photograph
and if you go places‚•πwell i mean i do go places‚•πcuz what ends up happening‚•πis it just sits there
unused‚•πyes‚•πhmm idk
i may build an fpv
but i want photos‚•πik
the fpv like
you can get
well
so
i would start with a small one
that way if you hit a tree
it doesn't like
blow up
and start a wildfire‚•πwell if i do it imma do the simulators first
then i would get one‚•πthere are "HD" variants of the small ones
which can record digital onboard
they cost a bit more
but the quality is still
rather meh
it depends what you wanna do and what your budget is
5-inch with a gopro is like
the best‚•πyea‚•πbut xpensive
idk you can borrow my Spark if you wanna take pictures
that way you dont have to buy your own
frankly
the town library or whatever
should just have some drones
that ppl can check out‚•πi mean i could
but i am going on a trip for spring break so i would like to either make or have one then‚•πyeah
i would probably not want you taking mine
for that long‚•πyea exactly‚•πidk if you have budget buy the DJI mini
its not a bad drone
ill tell you how FPV goes‚•πyea‚•πbut i dont think its gonna be a quick and easy thing
its gonna take a moment or two
to learn that‚•πit wont
oh mavic mini is like 400$‚•πqwality video‚•πwhere u goin
mega qwality 10/10‚•π100/10‚•πtrue‚•πyou should come over and see my spark tho akhil
before you buy a DJI
yeah you can go refurbished as well‚•πcy this gonna b better then fpv‚•πnoooo‚•πyuhhh‚•πfpv is much different‚•πmabic mini
is like fast
and spinny‚•πyeah but can it do flips
no it cant‚•πrip‚•πalso is it fpv‚•πbut it hab gud cam‚•πno its not‚•πu could prob make it fpv‚•πthe main thing with the fpv drones
is the analog video‚•πoh
yes‚•πor digital‚•πthats nice‚•πbut it has to be low latency‚•πwait cy do u still have the drone escs and motors from last summer‚•πyeah
imma use them when i build a 5 inch‚•πwhen u go to skool next mp can u bring them
i was gonna use them to build bigger drone‚•πyea get a nice frame‚•πno i was gonna do that‚•πi hav 3d modles‚•πidk i bought them
so i wanna use them‚•πwait i bought the motors and escs‚•πum
i dont think so‚•πi did‚•πi think you bought the RC
which i gave back
lemme check‚•πthe rc and escs and motors‚•πi have a spreadsheet‚•πyuh im glad we hav spredsheet‚•πlol waidaminet you did‚•πyuh‚•πok i giv back‚•πdere b no rush
but like u say ur gonna b in skool mp4‚•πbut if i giv back
you have to replace the wire u broke
on the FC‚•πok
what wire i bork
cuz i forget
lol‚•πhold on‚•πso i can get new one‚•πim trying to find the link
but they are really hard to find
there were 2
this is one‚•πok‚•πyou cut the wires off the other one‚•πyuh I rember
cuz i rember those wires were like not needed, do u still need dem‚•πyeah‚•πok‚•πi need them to be able to access both ports‚•πi will find replacement, if not i will buy new fc‚•πok
i mean i can try and find the replacement wires
since i have them here
but thx‚•πnp, i bork, i fix‚•πok‚•πI think I found it
is it an 6 pin or 8 pin connector‚•π8 pin
also that looks like the right one
idk how u find that so fast
WTF is that link‚•πi have no clue‚•πi heard of that one
its not a quadcopter tho
its a plane
so like‚•πyea‚•πidk if you want good pitchers
get the DJI
secondhand or whatever‚•πyea probably‚•πalso you should come over‚•πim lookin at some old mavic pros‚•πand try mine
before you buy
try mine and imagine it was yours
and if you crashed it it would be your problem‚•πhaha‚•πthen you will see
that maybe
idk
i can tell you
i regret
that purchase
it was way too much
for what i got out of it
lol if you want we can go to the drainage pit
by my house
and you can fly it
or i could come to yours‚•πyea it is expensive
i might honestly
just build an fpv
and if i want pictures
use my camera or mount a go pro on it‚•πyeah
the thing is the fpv and the dji are very different experiences
like
you cant look down
with an fpv
unless like
you point the camera down
before takeoff‚•πyea
idk i shall look into it‚•πalso its hard to take pictures
because like
you have to worry about flying
all the time
and not falling out of the sky
so you can have another person
with a live view from the gopro
who takes the picture for you
betaflight made an android app
so you can configure your drone
whilst you are out and about
without your laptop‚•πOoo thats fancy‚•πwhat i dont get is where they get enough money
for all those drones
i mean that wall goes on
they all have these walls of drones
I am adding a free illuminated button to my order
the question is
what color
its either gonna be green or blue
but i need to make a decision
yes i want a free strap
more decisions‚•πÏùåÏãùÏùÄ ÎßõÏûàÏñ¥‚•πcdknight: The food is good‚•πok‚•πramesh
what size strap
should i get‚•π250‚•πi think imma get the 225
ok
the Numworks doesn't have a headphone jack
its so annoying
everyone is copying apple these days‚•π...
Why would u want one
On a calc‚•πthe TI has a headphone jack
i really should have bought a ti.
i am now really sad.‚•πYea but for what purpose does it serve‚•πidfk‚•πGet one‚•πlike
oh wait
i remember
its like
you can plug 2 of them into each other
and send programs and stuff‚•πIntresting
So not a useful thing in everyday use‚•πlol no‚•πIt a pidgeo‚•πramesh remembers this picture
cy just spent $200 on drone stuff‚•πNice‚•πpidgen‚•πits not actually a pigeon
google Lens identified it
but i forgot what it was
ramesh remembers‚•πI do
media makers
we had to do stuff there
and you made it at media makers‚•πi did‚•πLet's play kicker king since apparently telegram can üÖ±Ô∏èimessage‚•πCheating rates drop to 0%‚•πgeez
next thing is like
"Stop world hunger"
world hunger rates drop to 0
she -3 from the denominator of the scores
so i went from a C+ to a B‚•πNice
I found out numworks has a store button as well
Which is convenient‚•πlol how else would you use variables‚•πIdk‚•πthe new numworks actually says sto->
not just ->‚•πYea
I need to update my calc‚•πno like the physical hardware
the button‚•πYea the button says that
Im just saying i should update my calc‚•πi need to listen to her talk about 3 dimensional vectors
bye‚•πI forget if i go back to epsilon and update or just update omega
Have fun
ah
amazing‚•πik
so amazing‚•πits amazing‚•πjust change the z index‚•π?‚•πand ur good‚•πhow does one change the z index‚•πin the css‚•πyea i see
whats a good value?‚•πum
z index those works and about me to like
20
like the boxes they are in
not the text‚•πthat didnt fix anything‚•πwhat
ngrok
i wanna see‚•πum lemme see‚•πor vs live share
either works‚•πill vs live share
thats easier‚•πok‚•πthat should work
its probably formatted awfully
i started testing on it and it ended up being this‚•πim examining it‚•πwant me to share server as well?
that should allow u to view the localhost website as well‚•πits already sharing
the server‚•πah nice then‚•πgee thanks for naming your classes rectangle and rectangle1‚•πwelcome‚•πbar1
bar2
bar3
l o n g t e x t c o n t a i n e r‚•πthats urs‚•πlol‚•πi just yanked the code off of that
and put it in this‚•πplease wait whilst i analyze‚•πhave fun
i should make each box have like a entire container or something
that would make it a lot nicer‚•πits
mostly
ok‚•πit could be better‚•πyes‚•πyea ill prob make it better when i move it into the proper thing
mabye ill use css modules‚•πi would make the about me and works
into like
containers
which contain
the bars
and the text‚•πthis‚•πthat would be a lot cleaner
yes‚•πthat makes hover so much easier as well
for le animations‚•πyes‚•πbut the left text
is still‚•πyeah‚•πneed work‚•πit does
i think you can get it to work though
just
maybe rely less on absolute positioning
it will make things better‚•π*cough
yea
everything is fixed‚•πalso make a new class
for bar
and rectangle
and text
for the redundant styling‚•πhmm yea‚•πi sort of did that
but not really‚•πi wanna see first how to move left text over‚•πi gtg tho‚•πits way to far right
yea ill work on it‚•πok bye‚•πcya‚•πmy package has been sterilized‚•πI hav question on frq thing for apcs
why do u need this line in the frq
like what does it do‚•πwhy is it written like that‚•πthat is the key‚•πlike
}))_)Ij;‚•πidk‚•πanyway let me see‚•πmuch thanks
also for context here is the prompt‚•πyea i got htat
im reading it rn
ok so‚•πit is ending like
4 things‚•πit says that the raceLength
has to be at least ten
otherwise it wont race
in that case you have to train‚•πyuh‚•πso it calls the train with the training time
the trainingtime tho
why are they dividing by 60‚•πcuz time‚•πi mean unless training time‚•πbut why would you have to call the train method‚•πit like
uses the superclass
i think
so it handles the like train method‚•πalso wouldent u put like super.train(trainingtime);‚•πu dont have to‚•πooooo‚•πu can but u dont have to in this case
since it's the same between the super class and the subclass
so for clarity you can
it's like
this.thing() vs thing()‚•πyeaa‚•πin a case where you override train‚•πi throught you always had to do super‚•πnah
think about it
it's like
in the runner class
either that, or im really stupid
im pretty sure im right‚•πI think you're right‚•πGood‚•πyuh, thank you ramesh‚•πNp‚•πlol I sent a message
and unigram
died‚•πbruhh‚•πits last words
they have this new update
the messages show up fancier
i tried to do my AP Sem assignment earlier today
and i literally collapsed
and fell asleep
on my desk
and woke up an hour later‚•πlol
I have done that once
with debate
it was like 1 in the morning‚•πlol this was 1 in the afternoon‚•πlol‚•πi have a tendency to do this sometimes
the problem was like
i was leaning on my leg
and i cut off its bloodflow
so when i woke up
i could not move it‚•πha‚•πand it was cold
i like
stumbled to my bed
and shook it around
until the blood flowed
i will not do that again
i will sleep on a bed next time‚•πwhen that happened for debate I fell off my chair and that is what woke me up‚•πlmao‚•πso at 5 in the morning my mother heard a loud bang
and thought we were getting robbed‚•πlolol
imma do my guided reading
bye‚•πbye‚•πso then
how do you know
someone has not uploaded the no no illegal stuff to it‚•πi dont‚•πUm
can the authorities come after you‚•πthe elites
you know
i could create
a google account
and upload illegal stuff to it‚•πyes‚•πand a Mega account‚•πbut if they do this‚•πand no one would know‚•πyou can comply
yes‚•πalso what do you consider "illegal stuff"‚•πchild pornography
is illegal‚•πi guess‚•πThe printing of da rocket engine commences‚•πwelcome to free video compression
featuring ffmpeg
is that like
a fancy resin printer‚•πYuh‚•πnoicety‚•πBut Amazon prime day‚•πhow much it costt‚•πSo 180‚•πBut what about
the originell
i spel‚•πLike 250 I think‚•πhow big
can in print
resin printers look nice‚•π120 68 170
it is big for resin printer‚•πo
thats
uwu
i shud get one maybe‚•πyuh‚•πif i actually used my regular 3d printer doe‚•πthey getting cheeper‚•πdo you have to like
level the bed‚•πno it autolevel‚•πand do the prints fail every time
SCHMANCY‚•πyuhhhh
its like super high quality prints‚•πbrooooo
i wanttttt
uwuwuuu‚•πits like a china sla printer tho‚•πthat fine
acchually‚•πthe softwhere is garbo‚•πdo you approve of the biden administration's handling of china‚•πcuz it no do cura
i haven't tried octoprint for this yet
idk if it would work
ima see
but for the biden china thing‚•πbut politck
yes‚•πyes and no‚•πinterseting‚•πyes on how he is taking a multinational approach to this
no to how he is simping the us military‚•πhow is he simping the military
i havent
heard about it yet
so edjucate me‚•πhe has canceled some traning excersizes and advised the pentagon to like stop sailing in the straight of Taiwan and the scs a bit‚•πInteresting‚•πso kinda letting china have at it with other nations in the scs
but i do like how he has not removed trump tariffs yet‚•πHmm
Idk how I feel about china tbh‚•πchina scary‚•πBecause on one hand their government
is garbage
like
the most god-awful garbage ever‚•πyuh‚•πbut there are also chinese citizens
and it's not their fault really their government is like that‚•πyuh‚•πthey dont really have a choice
so
if we start pressuring china
the citizens suffer
which is pointless
the government needs to suffer‚•πbut the thing is that the Chinese citizens are hurt more when china gets monee from trade
cuz china essencally controls all buisnuess‚•πWhat about
chinese businessowners
since
china isn't a command economy‚•πthey suffer more when china hav more money cuz like social credit system ect
and plus we would be weighing us jobs over china jobs‚•πif we let china flourish then perhaps like
the rich people can get enough power to throw out the government
ok who am i fooling
this is not going to happen‚•πlol‚•πimho as much as i really dont like it
the best solution imo
is like‚•πussr style‚•πthe US military gets involved and yeets the ccp to taiwan
and then the taiwanese governent
goes to beijing
i honestly dont know any other soultion that would work‚•πy would ccp go to taiwan‚•πor just outright
delete the ccp‚•πyuh
but that would be like ussr colapse‚•πthat aint happening‚•πwhere us pressure china to hav freedom of press‚•πdo you think covid came from the wuhan labs‚•πand then ppl revolt‚•πbecause if that is true‚•πit was proven by who‚•πno the who said that like‚•πlike they had study‚•πit came from animals in south china
but the who head said he was skeptical of the animal theory‚•πwait sry an austrialian ministry of health‚•πalso some people in the US said it too
like
biden administration people‚•πalso there was like big independent study‚•πand then also if it came from the wuhan labs
then hopefully
the entire world gets triggered at china‚•πi mean‚•πthen the ccp is screwed‚•πthe entire world simps for china‚•πperhaps
if they want to do something
stop recognizing china
recognize taiwan
and then
watch ur economy collapse‚•πand even though like its p ovious that china no control virus cuz censorship countrys still say that china no at fault
yuh
but the us can like only do that
cuz we hav bigger econ‚•πSo we need to reindustrialize or something
or I read that like investing in india is an option‚•πyea i read something on that too‚•πit could work
it would be nice if it worked
india is full of nationalists‚•πthat like India is going through its early stages of its industrial rev so us companies invest ther
e
yuh‚•πso it could like
democracy might fail
but I doubt it‚•πnah‚•πit's lasted quite a while there
like 70 years‚•πyuh and with like 1.5 b ppl its hard to change things‚•πalso i can do whatever the hell i want in india
like i can just go there and outright buy land without any issues‚•πlol
that is best‚•πi think i can do anything except like vote‚•πthat is how it is soposed to be‚•πbut‚•πbruhh‚•πthats because i have the oci thing
india
thing
like oci means overseas citizen of india
that magic thingy gives me visa free access to india‚•πwait u were born in india‚•πno
children of parents
can get it‚•πoooooo‚•πso technically i have a dual citizenship
too bad I dont have canadian citizenship‚•πdoes that mean dual taxes‚•πthen i could go to college for free
no‚•πlol
ooooo‚•πnot free
but like
dirt cheap
and the education is still good‚•πcuz like i hav a british friend who was born in the uk, but holds dual citizenship in us and is going to go to uk for collage cuz it is cheepo‚•πyuhhhhh
the US is like
the only place where college tuition is ridiculous‚•πthe high admission is due to gov loans tho‚•πI mean I could go to india for college
but still
im pretty sure I don't want to do that‚•πif gov stops giving out collage loans then collage price plummitt
yuh idt the schools are as good then as in the us‚•πthey told me that
the gov needs fund colleges more
they stopped doing that
so the colleges charge more now‚•πprivate collages were never funded by gov‚•πyeah
but public colleges‚•πcollages hav like unlimited monee‚•πwhy ramesh
do u have to ask this‚•πI like‚•πat this hour‚•πpolitical talk
It's engaging and fun‚•πcy has awoken
it is‚•πand I get to see multiple viewpoints‚•πi see‚•πso i dont live under a democratic rock‚•πalso you talked about octoprint on SLA/DLP
yeah no
they dont use GCODE
as far as i remember‚•πi mean i am not far right, but i offer different viewpoint, im like libratarian
yuh, mine uses like lgs30
witch is like for printer‚•πits a bunch of pictures‚•πcuz lcd‚•πyeah
that are displayed on the LCD‚•πyuh‚•πalso isnt the resin a mess
and a bad smell‚•πno
its not bad
like it smells a bit
but it is not messy
but it is not a overwhelming or bad smell‚•πlol you know what maker's muse said about the Elegoo SLA printer
he said it kept getting
ele-goo
all over his hands‚•πlol‚•πLonger Orange‚•πhow do ppl get stickey hands with resin
cuz like
u shake bottle
u pour bottle‚•πon hands‚•πand close bottle
pour slow then
idk‚•πi would get an sla‚•πmy hands dont get ele-goo‚•πbut i dont use my printer much
at least not right now
if i get into fpv
that's a different story‚•πcuz i hardwere person printer like my lifeblood‚•πespecially with the micro quads‚•πi am making roket test stand‚•πwhen u break things
its like‚•πi could print stuff for u‚•πhard to print them on big printer
you could‚•πsend files and i will print‚•πwait also how do u cure them‚•πuv‚•πno like
they need post curing‚•πyuh‚•πyou have a uv box‚•πi put them in an isopropal alchoal bath, then i hav like a uv germination chamber so i just put the parts in there‚•πgermicidal chamber you mean‚•πno germanation‚•πwait‚•πi germanate plants‚•πfor plants
not bacteria
whoops‚•πsan marazano tomatos
cuz Italian ppl‚•πcyfinfaza: san marazano tomato‚•πyou know what would be a fun science project
to attempt to encode VP9 or something similar into an analog signal
or a hybrid signal
both analog and digital‚•πmy grandpa act developed modulation techniques for signals transisioning from analog to digital while at bell labs‚•πyeah
for like
1G to 2G‚•πcell phones‚•πor was it from 2G to 3G‚•πno like analog raido waves‚•πyeah‚•πthen 1g
cuz it was super early stuff‚•π1g was analog‚•πi would hav to ask him tho
yuh so 1g to 2g, analog to digital‚•πactually
i think
so
1g was analog voice only
2g was analog voice with some digital and later internet options
3g was all digital‚•πyea cuz he did work on digital microwave raido
so def 2g‚•πyeah
2g was like
1991
release
so developed in the late 80s‚•πhe worked on it in the early to mid 80s
then moved to fiber
cuz da speeds‚•πmy dad is in fiber
not literally‚•πooooo‚•πbut professionally
he knows about the like
XUV
which makes the modern processirz‚•πooooooo‚•πthe Taiwanese
they have it all
they have
the XUV
no one else
has XUV
other than like
maybe samsung
that's why the government is supporting Intel
cuz
they want‚•πyuh cuz after the fall of atnt then lucent all transmission tech reacherch and manufacturing in the us went like poop‚•πXUV in the US
well this is manufacturing
see
XUV
is 13nm
compared to the previous generation
which was 193nm
my dad told me that XUV is the terminus
there is no need for anything else
after that
because
XUV is capable of making transistors
that are
as small as physically possible‚•πi read something on how they are making individual atoms transistors
is that like xuv‚•πthey did that a while ago
no
i dont think its xuv‚•πhow u get smaller then an atom then‚•πno i think it was impractical
or it just didn't actually work‚•πok
ima go cuz i hav the tired and i can act get sleep tonight
gn‚•πi have to do homework lol
gn‚•πthe ultimate procrastonation‚•πjust
most of it
cmon i need to do my chemistry‚•πthats why u dont do insider builds‚•πi suppose
i n t e r m o l e c u l a r   f o r c e s‚•πwindows has failed u
well had‚•πoh
wait
lemme check
im 2/4
I got Pres des √©toiles and Comme ci comme ca‚•πget urself that tld‚•π^^ instructions
right now im playing with rust
and finding out it has no ternary operator‚•πi made it work kinda
it was so weird
i had to set a left modifier to the left text to go back like 125 px‚•πdidn't i tell you to change the line-height property‚•πyea that started to change like its position on the page‚•πor is this not for that‚•πnot for that‚•πyou should surge‚•πits no where near completion‚•πthat doesn't matter
that way ppl can see
ur progress‚•πugh fine
deployed
im assuming its cloud and not my comp hosting it right?‚•πyeah
its CDN
what a dramatic sponge‚•πikr‚•πits not as bad as cloudflare
it called my project
broken-boat
tbh its not bad‚•πit isnt but
it could be much better
aka using components for 90% of this‚•πalso making it work better on mobile
and actually defining the font‚•πyea mobile ill do later
?
u mean not myFirstFont‚•πidk it does not appear that the font is set
its like
times new roman
and its
ugly‚•πuh it should be set
size is weird
rn‚•πidk its probably just me
although‚•πbut it should be using libre baskville
the css grabs it‚•πsend css
screenshot
oh its like
a static file‚•πyea‚•πoh its just the AV
that does not have a font
the rest of the text
is the correct font‚•πim stupid‚•πkeep working on it
then surge it when you have something more complete
then i will feedback‚•πugh this is gonna be annoying
ill work on it tmrw‚•πlol ok‚•πhopefully tmrw i can get everything to line up properly and mabye ill animate a soft load in thing‚•πyeah
Poisson d'avril
oh god i just watched the latest linus tech tips video‚•πYES
YES
The thumbnail alone‚•π^^ timestamped

Coming soon to a browser near you.
comp sci?
im bored‚•πHola
Nope‚•πwhy‚•πIm out‚•πoh out
like
out of the house‚•πYes‚•πwhere?
im bored
everyone is in the main room‚•πUh idk‚•πok
lol ramesh and his attendance system
wait am I smelling dinner or my power supply
cy's memories of kindergarten‚•πNope‚•πok‚•πI found 100$ of digital ocean credits
And so im making my vps and email server‚•πthatll last you 20 months‚•πI think the credits end in a year
But yea
Ideally‚•πlol
you should use Vultr
when you have to start paying
cuz its cheaper‚•πProbably
I need speeeeeeeed‚•πit has
3 gbps‚•πAnd outbound data transfer‚•πhow much is digital ocean giving you‚•π1 tb‚•πvultr on the cheapest plan
$3.50
gives you
500 GB
but
its for the largest transfer
so
you could have
500GB out and 499GB in
and they only count the out‚•πAh
DO has free inbound
And 1 tb outbound‚•πyeah so if you are only doing outbound
then maybe its better
although you are paying $1.50 less on vultr‚•πTrue‚•πalso
i think vultr only charges like
$0.01 per GB overage‚•πThats not bad‚•πalso how on earth are you supposed to use more than 500gb in a month
for personal use‚•πIdk‚•πactually according to windows i used around 550 GB of transfer
not including nextcloud having a spasm‚•πCy is surprised that people leave their house‚•πLol‚•πi wanna see if my email server works‚•πI senda eemale
Um
1 unsent‚•πdid u send it?‚•πI sent it
It's like
Hold on‚•πcause i sent emails to it to test
and its working‚•πIt's like
Cycling between queued and sending‚•πah fck
the domain is pointed towards a load balancer
and the server is running behind the balancer but it wont get lets encrypt certs
aka a vps‚•πWanna call
For a moment
I'm on my phone‚•πuh sure‚•πJoin voice chat‚•πwait
speak
my audio is broken one sec
try speaking now‚•πthere is 4h
in case you wanted to come
I may do an internship at this company
they need a new frontend
for their platform
and they wanna write it in react or angular‚•πFancy
Do they accept hs internships?‚•πwell so my mom's friend/relative came over
and his wife
is the CEO‚•πAh‚•πso I talked with her
and she said
she would like meet/interview to discuss
so like‚•πOo
Well if they accept u then that‚Äôs good‚•πshe wants to show me the platform they have right now
yeah
she said its too
"90's business looking"
so they wanna redo it
cy is sad
he wanted his drone
and its in bedminster
and they closed
18 minutes before
he realized he could go there to pick it up
so he wouldnt have to wait until monday‚•πnice
just wait the extra day
thats why u avoid usps
cause they dont deliever on sundays‚•πwell tbf I get what I paid for
3-8 days‚•πOkay cy u know how when we were debugging my certificate issue and u were proposing things that i could do to fix it‚•πYeah‚•πU said something bout a forward proxy and id like some explanation how that would work
Cause i have them vpnned together‚•πUm
Join vc‚•πBut im not home right now and i realize that for it to work i need to add iptables routes
Cant‚•πWait
what do you want me to answer‚•πThis‚•πalright so
its simple
you use privoxy or something
on DO
and then
you set it up system wide on ur home server
and then
when mailthing or whatever its called wants to request a letsencrypt
the request will go through the proxy
and will appear as your DO IP
which is the one that is in the DNS‚•πAh i see‚•πyou understand
what a proxy is
right
in this case
like
theres a proxy
which is for outbound requests
a reverse proxy‚•πYea‚•πfor inbound requests
or a vpn
for both‚•πReverse is from internet to a web server
Forward is from a server to the internet‚•πyeah but the server is acting as a client
when it does the letsencrypt
so you use a forward proxy‚•πMakes sense‚•πbut you just set up a vpn
so idk why u wanna do all that‚•πIf it dont work‚•πok
makes sense‚•πI gotta make haproxy route every connection to the server‚•πthing is‚•πWhich i think can be done very easily
With wildcards‚•πmaybe try nginx in stream mode
cuz then like
its one server block‚•πI could‚•πand you just list the ports you wanna forward‚•πI have to try
Once anything works
I can just go with that‚•πidk see what works‚•πYea
Hopefully having haproxy route will make everything work
Cause i do not wanna deal with iptables‚•πlol idk how iptables work‚•πI dont either
And that makes me scared‚•πi think u be fine with either a vpn
or haproxy and privoxy‚•πYup‚•πbut
heres a question‚•πEither one should work‚•πwhat if
you used a "cloud load balancer"
from digital ocean‚•πI could
Idk how they work‚•πthey may solve this kind of issue
like they may be designed for this
you should see if theres some dedicated system for doing this online
like some SaaS
rather than using IaaS‚•πI could
But the vpn method
Seems to be the most popular‚•πyeah
cuz its the most complete
and most logical‚•πTechnically speaking
Couldnt this also bypass the school blocked websites?‚•πwhat?‚•πWait no it cant
Dont mind it‚•πthey block vpns and proxies
ok try those things
ima go
bye‚•πYea i will
Cya‚•πTF IS THIS TRACKING HISTORY‚•πWait
It went back?
Kearny to basking ridge to bedminster back to kearny?
Tf is that‚•πikr‚•πI bet u
Its a missed/wrong scan somewhere‚•πi mean the whole system went offline yesterday
so that might be a part of it‚•πOr that yea‚•πthat said
if banggood
had shipped my order
on time
this would not have happened‚•πU would have gotten it today?‚•πi would have gotten it today‚•πAh figures
Well u gotta wait till monday‚•πyup
and i know‚•πI mean u could see if u can go and pick it up tmrw‚•πits gonna distract me
no u cant
last time to pick it up
was 1:30 PM today‚•πAh before loaded onto truck‚•πno before theyre closed
they close
at 1:30
on Saturdays
and are completely closed on sundays‚•πDo they?‚•πyeah its weird
also‚•πI swear they open way later‚•πnow its at this regional destination facility‚•πYea kearny‚•π;alksjdf;lakjsdf;lakjsd;fa;sdlfkja;s i w a n t m y d r o n e‚•π*cough‚•πlol wtf is that‚•πWhats happening to u
But way larger scale‚•πlol‚•πIt went from texas back to texas supposedly‚•πmine on fedex went fine‚•πYes this is a good app‚•πi dont like tho how i have to like
interact with the map through the text‚•πEhh it gets the information through‚•πi suppose
i mean other than that its pretty nice‚•πIve seen some many stores that use shopify
Its surprising‚•πits a good platform‚•πI never saw like shopify a year or two ago
And now everywhere i go i see it
Yea it‚Äôs convenient
God damn‚•πok go to like every dev tools website
and you see shopify
in their "who uses our service"
section‚•πi got le certs‚•πCool

If its translating from Chinese‚•πhahahelium
yeah its like if you are "concerned" you care and you wanna see
so i get it
lol Trump's has already unfolded‚•πOh no
That quickly?
I didnt expect him to unfold‚•πsomeone help this translator
theres no like written part to submit or anything right
can you turn back on the VaccineStock thing
my mom needs a vaccine
she was gonna use this other one
but i said she should use yours‚•πThe only reason mine worked was because I was up at 12AM
Otherwise
It does not work
So I would use the other thing
Like I would've gotten it without the bot‚•πok‚•πI think we need to submit the scripts we use but that‚Äôs it‚•πok
also do you know how long its supposed to be‚•πNo clue a couple of mins at least
I think 3‚•πi would imagine
ok
ill make mine like
4 mins‚•πHave u done anything for it‚•πno‚•πYeah same‚•πeverything is due friday
and thursday

my fpv drone comes today‚•πFpv?‚•πFirst Person View‚•πOhhh nice‚•πtime to jump rope
last time i tried to jump rope
my jump rope got tangled in the ceiling fan
so maybe not idk‚•πhow does my teacher
mess up my name
when its litteraly written down correctly
in every place possible‚•πhow do you mess up "akhil"‚•πahkil
no joke‚•πoh like ah-kosh
ah-keel
OH THE SPELLING
HAHA‚•πyea‚•πsmh‚•πidk teachers usually call me that when like speaking
even though its wrong kinda
english teachers especially‚•πwell theres also ak-hill‚•πthere is also just a-hill‚•πa hill‚•πyes
i am a hill‚•πlol
i got my drone
and i have now learned
if you leave it plugged in
and not flying
the vtx starts to burn up
so dont do that‚•πDid u destroy the drone‚•πi hope not‚•πAs soon as u got it?‚•πthe vtx still works
but‚•πOkay good‚•πessentially
i left it plugged in for about 2 mins
and
the video started fine
but
it gradually became
corrupted static
so
and it was getting realllly hot
i let it cool and rebooted it
and it appears to be fine‚•πwhat is this?‚•πSry it is hard to see, I'm in da bus so am on my fone‚•πimma try flying my drone outside
it now works‚•πgracias
what about the spaces?
oo how is it?‚•πhard
real hard
in my bedroom at least‚•πi would try flying in a simulator
um
fly outside
its so nice outside‚•πik
i just had it in my room
cuz like
configuration
and stuff
i put an sd card in the goggles
so i will be able to show you things
time to go outside‚•πhave fun
i think my dads gonna let me build a drone
or buy a mavic
i gotta present ledgers and spreadsheets to him tho‚•πlol my dad makes me do that too
although i bought this with birthday money
so i didn't have to this time
wanna see some utterly awful footage of me flying for 7 seconds, crashing upside down, not knowing how to use turtle mode, cursing because i have to walk over to pick up the drone for the 57th time then picking it up, flying it for 7 seconds and crashing again?
its so hard to fly
i eventually just took the goggles off
and flew without them
see in Acro mode you have to like
do the PID yourself
HumanPID
but that's the fancy mode
i did do a 360 flip into the ground
which hit so hard the vtx died for a moment
but the drone is not broken
so i think its pretty strong
lemme warn you if you are planning on getting one of these
get a small one
you will crash
continuously
i have crashed
like
109 times already
and i have broken the frame
just slightly
if i had crashed that violently on a 5 inch
it would have been a much uglier scene
also replacement frames are really easy, just $7, 16 screws and ur done‚•πOh god‚•πakhil is having second thoughts about fpv drones‚•πIdk
Yes and no
Mabye and so
I wanna get a mavic
But i also wanna build one
Idk i gotta decide‚•πok come to my house at some point
and fly mine
and then decide
excuse me
what‚•πSf4 cuz s is more polar cuz 6 es vs c 4es
More polar = higher boiling point
Cuz stronger imf‚•πwell i think yeah
i figured it out
cuz
the SF4 has lone pairs
which makes it polar
rather than nonpolar‚•πYuh‚•πso yeah
higher imf

the first ones are the hardest to write tho

or that was not gonna happen
then i miss math questions‚•πLmao two different responses‚•πso i cant ask mrs baker‚•πTru‚•πand she hasn't responded‚•πBut Akhil is in CP so he has an easy A‚•πlol‚•πvery easy A
except i dont pay attention
so its great‚•πAkhil just reminisces and thinks about life‚•πlol like me in Math Cycle in 7th grade‚•πyea ive been doing some of that
u know like just looking at what i did‚•πLol‚•πto get here

no no thats the apple stand
thats a tier of its own
u cant compare that‚•πapple feet‚•πheck yes
look at them feet‚•πno you can't look at them
thatll cost you $299‚•πthats fine
dude vesa stands are so expensivo‚•πum
my dad got one for like
$30‚•πyea thats how much they are‚•πi mean
what
do you want like
your monitor
to fall
and break
or something‚•πi dont feel like spending 12 + 20 + 30 to use my monitor vertically‚•πok then heres a solution
duct tape
hot glue
zip ties
done.‚•πtrue
but i dont have any of those‚•πok but they are cheaper
i mean what do you have‚•πnothing
except duct tape
and zip ties‚•πhear me out
take the back cover off the monitor
tape it down as a hinge at the top
then
make a long piece of tape
to make it be able to extend on the bottom
then
use that as a stand‚•πi see
that could work‚•πproblem solved ‚úî‚•πidk if it would be stable but it would work‚•πlol
now tell me
what does your ideal city look like‚•πum
um‚•πso i can use your ideas for my French homework‚•πideal city?
lets see
ideally its geometric
it has a set pattern
tf is that 5th point
marganilized communities?
god damn‚•πlike which ones will be present and why‚•πyea‚•πlike how will you optimize
to not exclude‚•πsee but if u think of it when u add a human element its very hard to optimize but anyway‚•πITSJUSTAFRENCHASSIGNMENTINEEDIDEAS‚•πthe city would have to be a break of bulk location
thats for sure
that way it is part of a larger economy‚•πlol ur being about as helpful to me as i was to you with that monitor stand‚•πprob a metropolis
see im in aphug
and we did city and development‚•πlol
owwwww fck‚•πso ur gonna get a lot more than what u want‚•πmy tounge

i completely broke the frame‚•πNice
Good job‚•πbut it was worth it
i think
i can just 3d print a new one if i need to

i think we can do better, IT wise‚•πNO
Chem got postponed
To april 22/23‚•πRIP‚•πNot the worst‚•πlol akhil go read the conversation in 4h computers
calum thinks that
his district
is worse than ours‚•πis that for a frame?‚•πWhy‚•πah which website‚•πDid u break your drone already‚•πits not did‚•πlol yes‚•πhe did‚•πNice‚•πShopify‚•πindeed
shopify‚•πshopify is bueno‚•πPorque‚•πbecause it is‚•πBecuase why‚•πbetter prices
better ethics

which is great
cause its usually better presentation and prices than amazon‚•πI will now consider using Shopify‚•πtwist ties‚•πbtw just to prime everyone here
I made my own hatchbox‚•πI see‚•πbut it's not happening yet
you will find it tomorrow
since officer apps are opening‚•πlol i erased the firmware on my drone
and i cant talk to it anymore
time to fix that‚•πShopfiy is like wordpress I think
it's just the platform that local etailers use‚•πyes, although
they have an api/sdk
for building your own website

No compromise
But whatever‚•πcy flew his drone more

but its not any more broken now than it was last time‚•πHuh
Mabye u should do a sim first
To mitigate its damage‚•πi could but
im getting ok
also its mainly my obstacles
now
ok so that works
but now
turn off your internet connection
and see that
it still works
LIGHTBULB
what if
i could use a service worker

A New View on Sports with Wearable Sensors
Professional athletes have three common goals: to perform better, to stay healthy, and to stay safe. For centuries, these goals have been achieved solely by the athlete, with little to no outside aid, except after problems arise. But recently, new technologies have arrived which can help athletes achieve these goals, the most modern of which are wearable sensors, which will be the focus of this written analysis. 
Wearables ‚Äì devices that can be worn for tracking and monitoring applications ‚Äì have grown to an over thirty-billion-dollar industry, in which some of the biggest tech companies, Apple, Microsoft, and Google, participate (PR Newswire). Wearables come in many forms, from simple and cheap pedometers to complex and advanced multi-sensor systems encompassing GPS/RTLS movement tracking and advanced heart monitoring systems (Li et al.). Some wearable technology has even been embedded into fabrics (Buki et al.). From training and performance analysis to rapid rehabilitation, these wearable sensors are capable of changing the whole field of sports and sports research.
Optimizing athlete performance gets increasingly challenging as an athlete progresses in their training, since clearly visible areas of optimization disappear, and in order further optimize performance, one has to look beyond the surface. Until recently, examining biological characteristics of athletes was an involved, expensive process. For example, in order to measure energy expenditure, a method such as direct calorimetry, where a person is placed in a chamber that measures their heat output, would have to be used (√Ålvarez-Garc√≠a et al.). Or, in order to measure the mental state of an athlete, a questionnaire would be used, which relied on the athlete‚Äôs capability to understand their emotions, and accurately record them (Zheng et al.). However, with modern advancements in biology and electronics, such characteristics can be measured in newer, more practical ways, using wearable sensors. 
Understanding the uses of wearable sensors in sports starts with understanding the different types of sensors, and how they work. These sensors can be mostly split into two categories, movement sensors, and sensors that measure the body. GPS (Global Positioning System) and IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensors are two of the most commonly used sensors for motion tracking, especially in consumer wearables (Aroganam et al.). GPS uses satellites to determine the wearable‚Äôs position on the planet. By taking multiple measurements, location can be tracked, and average speed, as well as distance travelled, can be determined. IMU sensors detect motion and momentum, and therefore can be used to track steps and record the force of impacts, among other uses. When it comes to sensors for measuring the body, there is a much more diverse landscape. Optical heart rate monitors, as well as electrocardiogram, electromyogram, and electroencephalogram sensors can be used to measure heart rate and heart irregularities (Seshadri et al. "Wearable sensors for monitoring the physiological and biochemical profile of the athlete."). In addition to heart rate though, there are many sensors available for detecting biomarkers. 
Biomarkers are measurable indicators of the status or condition of the body (Seshadri et al. "Wearable sensors for monitoring the physiological and biochemical profile of the athlete.").  They usually constitute bodily fluids, such as blood, urine, or sweat, but they can also be other measurable conditions, such as the conductivity of the skin. These sensors can be used to measure a myriad of things, such as hydration, intensity, fatigue, and stress (Seshadri et al. "Wearable sensors for monitoring the physiological and biochemical profile of the athlete."). Further data, such as performance and workload can be derived from the original data from these sensors (Seshadri et al. "Wearable sensors for monitoring the internal and external workload of the athlete."). Biomarkers can also be used to track allergens and allergic reactions
(Lee et al.). Sweat is one of the most commonly used biomarkers simply because of how easy it is to access, and how much it can convey (Seshadri et al. "Wearable sensors for monitoring the physiological and biochemical profile of the athlete."). In fact, in a study by Lindsay Baker from PepsiCo R&D Life Sciences, along with other researchers from nearby universities in Illinois, it was found that a non-electronic patch could be attached to the body, and microfluidic systems inside the patch would react with sweat on the body, resulting in a colored indicator representing a bodily condition (Baker et al.).
With all of this capability in wearable sensors, it is now possible to measure all the data that was once very tedious to measure, easily, and continuously, which provides for much better data for trainers and athletes to use when attempting to optimize performance (Seshadri et al. "A review of wearable technology"). The use of this technology has other benefits too. In research, for example, wearable sensing systems can provide much more frequent data than previous measurement methods, and they can be used outside the lab to track subjects in more realistic conditions (Wong et al.). Additionally, these sensors can help integrate disabled persons into athletics, by providing insights for equipment customization, and tracking technique and exercise to prevent injury (Rum et al.). 
To add to the physical benefits to using these sensors in sports applications, there are also mental benefits, which are often overlooked. Anxiety in particular, has a large impact on athlete performance (Zheng et al.). Zheng et al. from the University of Hong Kong, however, found that anxiety can be measured using cutting edge wearable EEG and PPG sensors, by identifying and processing heart regularity and variability, eliminating the need for the tedious and inaccurate questionnaires mentioned above. Confirming the efficacy of wearable sensors in identifying psychological conditions is a study by Bailey et al. from the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, which found a correlation between cognitive conditions and data taken from EEG sensors (Bailey et al.). More broadly, the ability to measure and quantify anxiety means that psychological benefits of sports, such as the ones mentioned in Psychological Benefits of Sports and Physical Activities by Alicia Garcia-Falgueras from the Official College of Psychologist in Spain, can be tracked, and their effects can be proven for each individual. Individuals could identify whether their emotions are actually changing, and where they could improve to optimize the positive effects of sports on their mental health. 
Another large use for wearable sensors in sports, is for medical use, when and after injuries occur. Injuries in sports usually come from collisions between players, or between a player and the ground. GPS and IMU data can be recorded to track the speed and impact force of collisions, and this data can be processed using AI technologies to classify collisions (Kelly et al.), which could be used to provide insights to trainers and medial staff, for faster identification of the aid required, and for avoiding future incidents. 
Wearable sensors however also find themselves playing a great part in rehabilitation and recovery after injuries. For rapid and efficient recovery after an incident, proper planning, timing, and knowledge of the current conditions of the patient are neccesary (Dhillon et al.). Many current methods of planning a rehabilitation focus primarily on the period of time since the incident, rather than on actual data (Johnston et al.). And when these traditional methods do resort to collecting data, they are often collecting it with older systems, that do not provide continuous measurements, but rather only spaced-out, periodic measurements, that result in inaccuracies. It is vital to be able to track a patient even when their symptoms are no longer acute, since restarting activities when the body or the brain still need time to heal could have unseen consequences. Johnston
et al. provides an example in post-concussion monitoring, where wearable sensing devices are used to track cognitive characteristics, such as balance ability, and accompanying software is used to measure cognitive capability through more advanced, personalized questionnaires, long past the acute phase of the concussion. 
Despite all the advantages of using wearable sensing devices, there are still limitations and ethical concerns with the use of these devices. Given how recent and advanced modern wearable sensing systems are, many of the limitations are not completely known, and identifying them can be a complex process. The effectiveness of every sensor in the system must be analyzed individually, and external Cloud processing must be analyzed as well (D√ºking). Additionally, their effectiveness in the consumer space is questionable. In a study by Bridget F. Melton from Georgia Southern University, the effectiveness of a consumer wearable system was tested to see if it would improve or increase the physical activity and sleep quality of the participants. The study did only focus on one racial, gender, and age demographic, but it found minimal to no improvement in physical activity and sleep quality in participants, as was the goal of the system (Melton et al.). These types of results make wearable sensing in consumer applications seem less desirable, although more research would need to be examined in order to come to a definitive conclusion. 
The main criticism of wearable sensors, however, is in their ethics. Most wearable sensors are part of a larger sensing, tracking, and analysis system. A sensor, being a low power device with minimal onboard processing capabilities, will often connect to a mobile device, such as a smartphone via Bluetooth or BLE (a lower power version of Bluetooth), and transmit data to the device, for it to process (Wang et al.). This data though is usually not stored directly on the device, but with a cloud service, that will often be running machine learning algorithms on the data to provide more relevant results (Wang et al.). This means that data collection and handling is in the hands of a company, and the processing and analysis of the data is usually being done by a computer algorithm. The result of this is that while the validity of data may be fairly high, it is not completely guaranteed that it will be correct, or that the person seeing the results will know how to interpret them. Most professional teams do not have time to do additional research on these systems; they are simply looking for a quick return on investment into the system, and so many of them will simply accept whatever the system returns to them, without question (Arnold and Sade). This can become an ethical challenge, since data like this can have a great effect on a player‚Äôs career, and if it is wrong it could end up damaging a player‚Äôs career without warrant (Roberts et al.). The other ethical concern, of course, is that of surveillance. If data is being sent to a corporation to be stored and processed, that data could also be shared with advertisers, or other, more malevolent entities. Worse, there are instances of teams introducing such systems without data collection consent from players (Arnold and Sade). Government policies on data sharing, especially medical data sharing, will need to be put in place to avoid incidents with athletes‚Äô personal data.
In conclusion, despite the aforementioned limitations and ethical concerns, wearables and wearable sensing have huge potential to change the way sports work. In a letter to his children written in 1903, Theodore Roosevelt addresses his concerns about the safety and usefulness of sports. Today though, with modern technology like wearable sensors, athletes will be safer than ever, and will have the best opportunity to excel in the sports they wish to pursue. Comments like those made by Roosevelt in 1903 simply no longer hold up today. From optimizing performance to aiding in injury rehabilitation, the possibilities of wearable sensing in sports are endless.
I giv to u
1925 words‚•πthats  alotta words‚•πikr
I wrote 1756 of them today‚•πlol procrastination is best‚•πlol‚•πI made roket and printed test stand today‚•πcool‚•πIs this for AP seminar‚•πyes‚•πso over spring break ima make boom boom‚•πlol boom boom‚•πDude I literally procrastinated and filled out an application
How do I guys get so much work done
U guys*‚•πakash do not be jealous of how much work I get done
it may look like a lot‚•πi sat for most of the day watching a printer go burr‚•πbut im probably the most inefficient person you know‚•πCy‚•πlol i think i hold title for second‚•πI still haven‚Äôt started the animal 3.0.

and then
he ask me
cy
why my game slow‚•πPython is fun‚•πand then like
hes running at‚•πIt is not like Java‚•π550 fps
and im like‚•πJava is confusing‚•πok so that's why its lagging
alla time‚•πlol
python just goes‚•πyes
it does
the wheels on the python go round and round
round and round
round and round
the wheels on the python go round and round‚•πcy can u get an esp 32 to do like the aurduino stuff but in pyton
cuz i dont like aurdumo‚•πuPython?‚•πwhat that
oooooooo
now microcontroller - r pi link ez‚•πwdym‚•πcuz like i was gonna hav an r pi transmit data from aurduino over wifif, but i realized with esp u dont need  pi‚•πbut
from what sensor
cuz like
you can just connect a sensor to the pi
no Arduino‚•πno cuz it over i2c‚•πyeah
pi has i2c‚•πit doez‚•πyes‚•πi dont know how to use
ima look it up‚•πits not as easy to use as on arduino
i tried it once
its not that hard
but
sometimes you have to do your own implementation
because there arent a lot of libraries
what sensor are you using
model # please‚•πi send
one sec‚•πcy is analüëÅzing
please wait üîÉ‚•πthis is not exact one
cuz the one i hav is i2c‚•πwell i need the exact one‚•πbut i could not find it‚•πwhere did you get it from‚•πwamazon‚•πlol
you should stop using amazon
its xpensive
and slow‚•πbut order on moms account cuz she hav da prime‚•πik but i went to other website
and
i get free fast shipping‚•πsend site‚•πand everything is 10-40% cheaper‚•πcuz i need knolage‚•πwell i was buying drone stuff
so‚•πit no hav load cell rip‚•πbut like
wait
ok so this one doesn't come with an ADC board
but you can just wire it up to the ADC on an Arduino or ESP32
pi no have ADC i dont think üòû‚•πim using a bootleg aurduino nano so idt that hav adc‚•πif its a microcontroller
it has an adc
like
almost 100% chance‚•πwhat adc‚•πAnalog to Digital Converter‚•πooo then yea‚•πthe thing is
the 8 bit arduinos dont have very good adcs
so i would use an esp32
wait
did you know
raspberry pi made a microcontroller‚•πyeaaa i saw that‚•πi think it does uPython‚•πi mean wireless data transmission is not that important to me
and i hav bootleg aruduino‚•πwell what are you using this for‚•πbut ima look into rpi microcontroler‚•πlab testing?‚•πroket test stand
to test engine thrust‚•πyeah so then you dont need wireless
just plug it in‚•πyuh‚•πalso if you have a Nucleo
i think that has a better ADC‚•πi act do‚•πits like 16 bit or something‚•πi thought it 32‚•πi think the Arduino is only 10 bit‚•πcuz arm‚•πno that's the bus‚•πoooooo‚•πthe adc is different
i know the main thing with the Arduino is that the timers are only 8 bit
or you can run them in 16 bit mode with a hack but then they run at low freq‚•πbut that dosent rly matter for me
see i need high freq
cuz like engine go quik‚•πi mean‚•πalso it l8 so ima go bed‚•πyou could also
get an oscilloscope‚•πmoneee‚•πthere was a random one in my amazon cart for cheap
but i think an Arduino is fine
just give it a try‚•πyuh‚•π10-bit is probably good enough‚•πyea cuz it is also a p bad sensor
like +- 1.5 g‚•πi have to create a works cited‚•πima sleep
bye‚•πgn
proxy is making progress‚•πwhat is this for?‚•πits a proxy so like‚•πxip‚•πyou can access blocked sites
no that's like a dns thing‚•πoh for school‚•πthis is a full on proxy‚•πwhat language‚•πsee the user agent‚•πah
I see‚•πexcept the way it works is really cool‚•πha I already have one
but its not rly useful lol‚•πyea i dont see any use for one in school rn
granted im not in school‚•πcuz like the only bocked site i go on is messenger cuz the ppl on deb8 use that
blocked
being virtual is ez
but i hate it
cuz i dont comprehend anything‚•πno u dont
not this type
you have a regular proxy
this is an in-browser proxy‚•πoooo
why dont u use a regular proxy‚•πthis is different
I cant talk much now
bye‚•πok bye‚•πmichael's texting style is interestg‚•πyuh, most things i say are like spelled wrong and have no grammer whatsoever, and i do things like cuz and much abbreveation
also i made logo for roket stuff
how it look‚•πoo
it could be a bit simpler
so it looks good as an icon‚•πok so like just the two arches
and no thing on to
p‚•πno it needs that other thing
but like
make them thick lines
maybe round them‚•πah ofcourse
good ol greek
u could
i would reccomend just looking at greek fonts and finding one, cause it looks like u used lines and whatnot to make the lambdas‚•πhi
i made my proxy
does someone wanna try my proxy‚•πcool‚•πand find the isp‚•πwhich room‚•πcan you come to 3‚•πwhy?‚•πlol i found some "file" with "SSSS Access Token"
but i have otherwise not gotten anywhere‚•πits been almost 3 hours
how has it been?‚•πi need a hint‚•πthat would require ramesh
not me‚•πbut u know how to do it
so‚•πi do
but its not my challenge
so‚•πi guess
*sigh i made a little progress
now ramesh can track me‚•πwhat did u do?‚•πthis may be better
things‚•πlike what?‚•πidk lemme keep trying more things‚•πokay
well imma just say rn its been officially 3 hours at this point i believe
ah i sent the wrong card
that should be updated‚•πdid you get there‚•πi got to the url thing
with the header
but i put a header
and it doesn't work‚•πok wtf are you doing
I mean this in the kindest way‚•πlol you can look at your logs‚•πbut you are still
hmm
my gitlab pages logs?‚•πno your Caddy logs‚•πah
he got soemwhere
what header did he put‚•πSSSS-Access-Token‚•πwhat access token did you put‚•πbramc135o85jofaae7sv7ffgjqokxvbmlixsewbb02vhrwwxzv‚•πshow
the entire request
Hmm
ok so
you are a bad
and you did not follow the hint.‚•πwhich hint‚•πwhat you put in there is not the hint
bye‚•πif i supply an access token though
it should tell me
that its wrong
not that it can't find it‚•πNoted‚•πim going to figure out IndexedDB
bye‚•πso cy gave up
ok
this time im even more surprised‚•πlol i sorta gave up
but not really
but kinda‚•πcan i just tell you
this is the dumbest mistake ever
look at your token
and look at what is in discord‚•πlmao
its lowecase‚•πNice job cy‚•πcy is listening to Ridge Choir Decades Show 2021
Live right now‚•πLol Cy got stuck again‚•πwdym‚•πhe didnt get far yet
but this part
is comparatively easy
so ill leave you‚•πwhats unclear is how the key will need to be posted
i dont have it yet
but‚•πyou will get it
100%‚•πif i make a post request‚•πjust read the instructions carefully‚•πwell no cuz like
i make a post request
with some key
in the data
and it tells me "Not Found"‚•πit is very easy
one could say its
intuitive?‚•πno that's not my issue
i dont think
what i do not get is like
how to form my post request
after i get my key‚•πfirst get a key‚•πwell also what i dont get is how to make the final key‚•πthen u can worry about a post request using said key‚•πbut i can probably figure that out
hold on‚•πyea
it is very easy
one could say its
intuitive?‚•πwhich part of it tho
cuz like
so what is?‚•πidk‚•πi keep getting 404 not found
um
I still don't get how the submission works‚•πThe original thing
was easier
I removed a character
Maybe I'll add it back‚•π?
a character‚•πYes
one character was removed
plus a bunch more was added but whatever‚•πwhat character was removed‚•π/‚•πfrom where‚•πOh? /‚•πcy hasn't even solved this game yet
but he already has an idea for one‚•πalso you get extra points for guessing [idk how] (1 try) the language/framework I used to make it‚•πruby
lol‚•πframework
is required in your guess.‚•πon rails‚•πWrong.‚•πlol
what did you use‚•πYou lose.
Game over.
Sinatra/Ruby‚•πk‚•πThe Don Salvara Game
You get more points if you can guess what OS/server/etc this uses
How it is being hosted‚•πNixOS/Caddy/Linode‚•πWrong
That also doesn't have the unicorn/puma (like uwsgi/gunicorn) stuff‚•πlol idk‚•πAlpine Linux to Caddy to alpine docker to puma to kode
Not right now
Um‚•πlol guess‚•πidk it takes the subdomain
and
finds out it corresponds to something
sends a request
and returns the response‚•πhow does it proxy all the resources on the page
they can link all over the place‚•πproxies those too‚•πhow tho‚•πim seeing‚•πsee this is actually a somewhat nontrivial problem‚•πrewrite the html‚•πno
this is my 3rd attempt i think
and it has finally worked.‚•πExcellent‚•πits about 20 lines of server side code
but there is client-side code‚•πhmm
it just proxies the data
if it uses relative paths‚•πwait ramesh‚•πwhat‚•πhold on
and open the console
and type
now
go to
and do the same thing
ok try in chrome
where it actually works‚•πnot now
I have to eat‚•πyou will see
how
even that fetch request
is proxied‚•πHmm
Service workers‚•πyes‚•πHAH
thats quite interesting
but I have to eat‚•πk
idk what ur doing eating at this hour
but i wont judge‚•πI legitimately have not eaten‚•πlol im doing this in algebra rn‚•πlol
i literally completed all the codingbats in 10 minutes last night at 23:49‚•πhahahahah
I did the first 2 but then was like I dont wanna do it anymore‚•πthey are all so easy
like 2-3 lines of code‚•πrly‚•πwait no actually the count8 was 4 i think‚•πthe last ones look kinda hard
well for me at least
i dident do them yet tho
so idk
lol 2 lines
i do the indents so was like bruhh how 2 lines‚•πlol‚•πim at my dads hous so i dont hav another computer to do zoom
my waptop is munching battery
is dat prozy
proxy‚•πyes‚•πhow u make in browser
well act let me think
is it like u make website search stuff, but then u return stuff through website and not browser‚•πservice workers‚•πwhat is that‚•πeveryone else: lazy
programmers: efficient
My drone is now stuck in the highest tree
Yipee‚•πNice‚•πGoddamit that took hours
I think ups delivered my package to the wrong house
And now I don't know what to do‚•πfind the house
knock on their door
and kindly notify them‚•π*yawn
Ok I guess I'll do that
Nobody was home
What is it with me and luck these past days‚•πUm
Then just leave it
And they will return it to you‚•πok i got my package
my mom just texted the neighbors
their doorbell wasnt working
cy is figuring out how to manually implement TOTP
for reasons
I got the fancy google app update
With the fancy animation‚•πThat‚Äôs some fancy animation
Mine has animation
Not as fancy tho‚•πand its especially fancy
because
when you type a domain
it automatically fetches the favicon‚•πWhy
thats paranoid level
Startpage in an anonymous proxy running pages in anonymous mode‚•πlol cy is ultra paranoied
u should then search startpage in startpage‚•πWhats he doing to be so paranoid
Yes
And then view cys thing‚•πnah, he is just making an in browser proxy
I made one with my pi
it is good enough
and is prob better then his
cuz like I can route applacations through it
like the discord updater
that is blocked with skool wifif‚•πi have one of those too
privoxy
and a vpn
but
in browser is the best cuz you can instantly use it anywhere
no need to configure anything‚•πYuh but like why would you need to use a proxy on a device other then yours. That is not likely this year in school or anytime soon cuz pandemic‚•πThis thing I've been using is amazing
NVIDIA vGPU support on consumer GPUs‚•π"Update Windows"‚•π^^ timestamped‚•πlol I saw that‚•πHow
Just how‚•πnet above da pool‚•πcodetools is making me sick

I may take the liberty this spring break
to attempt a full jamstack approach
im 80% of the way to that decision
contemplating how much code would have to be rewritten
its between next.js and gatsby
im leaning towards gatsby‚•πNice one chief
I sadly cant really work on anything‚•πare you like
not home‚•πYes‚•πah nice
im home
rewriting code
for the‚•πMust be nice‚•π*cough
third time‚•πHaha‚•πbut this time
its gonna work.‚•πDont worry about it
Im just documenting‚•πlol
i estimate
about
40%
code rewritten
mainly because i have to move a bunch of server-side logic client-side
but i think it will work
and besides
its more interesting than actually adding functionality
step 1: make an api
J-avascript A-pi M-arkup
wait akhil
are you in a different time zone
where are you?‚•πYes
Im an hour behind i believe
So ur florida, texas time
Cancun
Mehico‚•πah
wait so
yeah
central time
one hour
so its 7:48 where you are‚•πYea‚•πon Wednesday
an electrician will come
to my house
and find a GFCI
its so pathetic
its not that hard to build a house where all the GFCIs are visible
then after they do that like 8 outlets will start working
tbh ill be pretty amazed if they can find it
i have spent hours
looking
everywhere
in the meantime, i have to write an API
so what am i waiting for
imma get started
someone tell me why this works in chrome and not firefox
lol wtf is this
get Unregistered
wait
chrome also had a service worker registered
wait
now theyre both gone
and
it still works in chrome
and doesn't work in firefox
cy: i should use graphql
cy2: gtfo im not making a graphql api

im rewriting code
which is kinda like doing math homework
it takes time
its very tedius

bye‚•πbye
How many problems?‚•πHuh‚•πno its working
those are yellow problems
problems as important as
of course now
and those are red
but‚•πUm
*cough‚•πi just have to copy and paste 300 lines of code
and then it will work

yeah exactly
with the galaxy buds
i like jamstack
i will be using jamstack from now on‚•πHave fun‚•πjamstack provides rapid development and deployment, and it provides greater scalability
now i have to make a good ui
im not sure how i wanna make it
it doesn't have to do too much

I have never gotten tested‚•πThey stick this small thing up ur nose
All the way down‚•πThat must feel interesting‚•πIt tickled and hurt at the same time
It was very weird‚•πLol‚•πU got ur second dose?‚•πNo first‚•πAh nice‚•πSecond is may 6th
But apparently the first dose alone of pfizer is like 70% effective‚•πYea so u should be good
I need to get stupid covid testing

Okay thats not that long‚•π15 mins you have to be observed‚•πStupid zones‚•πIt's weird they have the national guard here‚•π?‚•πLike the personnel at this facility‚•πAt the hospital?
Huh‚•πIt's like half national guard members
And half other ppl‚•πHuh
It might be military personnel
To ya know
Stop people
Also i realized i broke face id
I can face id
With a mask now
Thats not a feature
I need to redo my face id
Which is sad cause its been learning and stuff for 2+ years‚•πI mean
You should redo it somewhat often
For better speed‚•πTrue‚•πAlthough that's more relevant to fingerprint‚•πYea face id is pretty fast

hes like
i hate that title
get rid of it‚•πWrite, Practice, Test
Yes‚•πno on my essay
it had a title
and he said
like
no
that's a bad
title
remove it
i dont like it
imma eat dinner bye
Coffee
so apparently if my drone gets wet enough outside the rx shorts out and it can't listen to the transmitter anymore
it was a good test of the failsafe settings, i guess
now i have to wait for it to dry
i think Vercel is stuck in a loop
trying to build my application
it seems to be messing with my submodule inside a submodule
imma take my old api code
and like
strip away all the non-api parts
that were used for the non-jamstack version of CodeTools
cy know how to use git‚•πGit control is nice
No yeah i do the same‚•πyou see cy reads some thing saying how to use submodules
so he adds a submodule
then
he wants to remove it
and he cant figure it out
'xcuse me
what
i did that
is it gone
did replit delete it
hi ramesh
i have not talked with ramesh in a while
ramesh i worked on codetools
you should see the progress
it is now fully jamstack
obviously the websockets stuff and jrunner cannot really be serverless
but the frontend and main api are‚•πcy how u get vaccine, my mom was still not able to get hers‚•πmy dad signed me up at like 7 different sites
and one of them said we have excess
come get it‚•πlol‚•πyea that's how everyone I know got theirs
you go at the end of the dya
or yu qualify
or yu use bot‚•πyu‚•πhonestly it is not worth it cuz like my mom healthy and I  healthy and im still kinda skeptical of it cuz it under emergency use authorisation‚•πeh
it works‚•πso im in no rush
yuh‚•πaccording‚•πit works‚•πto israel‚•πmy mom was like‚•πi might as well get it right‚•πur going back to school‚•πso‚•πu need a vaccine‚•πlol‚•πramesh‚•πi already have one‚•πi need comments on‚•πill be getting two
later‚•πi finally did kode for test stand
it work now‚•πcool‚•πI j filled my motor with the fuel and insulator
tommorw ima do the test fire‚•πremember to video
and send‚•πOoo‚•πyuh‚•πthere is 4h
4h is now
now is 4h‚•πCool
I cannot attend
Due to circumstances‚•πi mean
its all virtual anyway
although
actually
the time zones
are like‚•πNo its not even time zones
Yea‚•πoh wait
ur home now‚•πSi‚•πWelcome to New Jersey‚•πIts good to be back‚•πWe hope you enjoy your stay‚•πWatch
The immigration officer will say the same thing
Im assuming i gotta go through sekurity twice but yea‚•πok‚•πRip my rocket has not fully cured ima hav to postpone test to tommrow‚•πsad
but u dont wanna launch it while its weak
so
see I have a dilemma
i wanna switch databases
for codetools
i dont wanna use mongodb
there are better options‚•πThen switch‚•πi would have to rewrite the code
again‚•πThen rewrite it‚•πalso i would have to learn
how to use this database‚•πThen learn‚•πand host it
cuz like‚•πThen host it‚•πmongodb gives me free reliable hosting‚•πUse a vps and host‚•π$
dgraph also has free hosting
but
its 1MB of transfer per day
which is
*cough
not enough‚•πIdk i would say switch dbs
Do it now rather than later‚•πi mean it would be really useful to have dgraph
especially right now
cuz i can be like
get me all the names of all the owners of all the challenge_editors who's parents have this ID
all in one query
but they dont have free hosting
and i want my free hosting
trying to keep costs down
right now codetools is going to be hosted on Vercel and Vultr
since i offload the main UI and API to Vercel i dont have to put much on vultr
so i can use my existing one
and Vercel is free‚•πi wanna try vercel
ive seen it a bunch‚•πits so nice
^^ vercel
it is nice in particular because it has python api support‚•πalso do u have mongodb set up with a hot standby?‚•πand my api is python
?‚•πsince one mongo thing is 500mb
u can have it switch to another one once its full‚•πi dont need more than 500mb
so im not going to bother with trying to configure that
on Atlas
they probably prevent you from configuring that on atlas
because like
they dont want you having more than 500MB‚•πi mean
u could prob make a script to do that
as long as they have some sort of api for creating and destroying instances‚•πTbh idrc
I'll just get some funding if I actually need it
But 500mb is a lot‚•πyea‚•πThey also give you faster network if you pay I think‚•πi mean
u have mongodb credits
for free
like 100$
so u could use that‚•πDo I?
With github?‚•πgithub student dev thing
yea‚•πHmm‚•πi think its 100$‚•πI wonder if they have some for dgraph‚•πu can check
i dont think so‚•πImma check that later
I gtg rn
Bye‚•πadios‚•πim switching my lights to tasmota‚•πI got my second shot‚•πYet‚•πYet
Key word‚•πTell me‚•πTomorrow might be my last day‚•πWhat search engine did u use after getting the shot
It was bing right?‚•πof course
it was really weird
i just felt this urge
to start using bing‚•πInteresting‚•πAnd I felt really warm cuddly feelings when I heard the word "bill gates"
yeah‚•πUr also installing windows now rnt u‚•πsee my windows usb
died
i have to use an actual windows vm‚•πVery interesting‚•πbut
yeah
i really want to install windows for no reason‚•πIts begun‚•πi mean‚•πThe Microchipping‚•πbill gates is helping us
it's our only shot to get out the pandemic
but im really thankful for bill gates
?
what do you mean‚•πOh nothing‚•πbill gates really helped‚•πMan u certainly love bill gates huh‚•πyeah idk why
but yeah
ur right
ive
always loved bill gates tho‚•πWhat about windows
Ik u disliked it at a point‚•πno?
im installing it rn idk
this is windows tho‚•π*in the corner of his vision, there it stood. ‚ÄúHi‚Äù, ‚ÄúWere getting things ready for you‚Äù*‚•πman akihl i wish windows phones were still a thing‚•πHaha‚•πu know ive wanted a surface duo for a while
sucks that it ain't windows
but whatever‚•πThey are
Nokia phones exist‚•πi want a nokia phone
with
a bill gates signature‚•πUm‚•πi love bill gates
i changed my pfp‚•πHaha‚•πwdym
im really
thankful for bill gates‚•πhi ramesh‚•πhi
i love bill gates‚•πlove love?‚•πlove bill gates
not love love
bill gates
that would be weird
but I love bill gates‚•πlol‚•πNope
"Later"‚•πlol‚•πI am actually trying to install windows right now
and I need to make it install windows‚•πi should do homework‚•πthe johnson and johnson vaccine was cancelled
what do you think cy‚•πi mean
idk
if its bad
dont use it
i want to switch databases
Hello? Vercel? Anyone there? Can you um, build, please?

hi my name is mr y
today we will be discussing the second component of PT2, the IMP
the IMP is a 6-8 minute presentation
that must incorporate all your research
it is 15% of your AP score
I want your slides in by this wednesday‚•πnice‚•πWhy did you get something‚•πno im just wondering
since you emailed him
recently‚•πIdk you could email him and say we're vaccinated or something
Well me
More than you‚•πlol
i mean

80% effective‚•πYes‚•πbut u need the second one‚•πU don
Do
Idk why don‚•πidk either‚•πAkhils right
phone keyboard‚•πno im just saying like its better than no vaccine‚•πyeah‚•πalso a side effect might be that u start to love bill gates and microsoft so‚•πbut like can we do ipad club if we hab vaccine‚•πi already have that side effect‚•πhaha‚•πpre existing conditions‚•πwhat is ipad club?‚•πtbh the answer is probably no
for a while
cuz theyre old ppl
and like
we need to wait
also idk if fv would even let us in‚•πoutdoor‚•πlol true‚•πidk i just want life to be 2019 again
and i am
getting closer
to this‚•π*sigh
pandemic‚•πdid anyone else get vaccine‚•πc'est la pandemie‚•πso far 3 friends have it
oui c'est mais je deteste‚•πum
no
its
grammatically incorrect
and
it doesn't rhyme‚•πLol
ramesh clearly no know french
√©videment je ne sais pas le fran√ßais‚•πlol‚•πcdknight: lol‚•πlol‚•πcdknight: lol‚•πi love bill gates‚•πthe JS compiler wants me to use ===‚•πhai
do you know anyone else who has gotten the vaccine
I know one who has both shots‚•πthats alot of equal signs‚•πand two who have one‚•πik someone who is getting it‚•πidk anyone‚•πin the next few days‚•πim just trying to plan my post pandemic party‚•πnice
oh god‚•πlol

its amazing‚•πkwality
¬≠WAIT I HAVE A SURFACE PEN
AND ITS BATTERY IS PROBABLY NOT DEAD
WAIT
i was like
oh no
how am i gonna do my chem and math and French without my bamboo ink
the battery is dead
i think i can just pull the battery from my surface pen
dammit that battery is dead too
;alksdjf;alskdfj
i am going to charge my alkaline battery
i have no idea how to do this
tf‚•πwhy?
just get a new one‚•πi need my pen
now.‚•πyea just get a battery‚•πi asked my dad to get one
but theyre really hard to find
you have to get them online
i just need the slightest bit of charge
it just died today during chem
and i only need it to work until a new battery comes
so imma put my variable psu at 3v 20ma
and see if it charges‚•πdont blow up‚•πproblem is its not making good contact
hold on
thing is like
the battery isnt getting warm
so where is the energy going
it must be going into the battery
ok the battery is charging
it went up to 1.05 volts‚•πnice‚•πi cant charge it for too long tho
cuz it might leak
and then that would be bad
reliable, dependable quality‚•πKwality‚•πthe problem is the voltage drops rapidly after it is disconnected
meh
i mean
one of these batteries at full capacity lasts 1-2 years of regular use
so 1-2 days is 365 times less charge than that
that i need
ok im trying it now
the pen works
sorta
no the pen isnt working anymore
its making a high pitched buzzing sound‚•πthats not good‚•πim charging the battery more‚•πDid it work‚•πit did
remarkably
enough for me to draw my French visual component
hi matt i stole your idea of putting the city on a mountain‚•πDang I can‚Äôt compete with those skills
Also new hackintosh‚•πcool
i need to choose slide transitions
i have it set to page curl
like a book
cuz like
im telling a story
but there are some really fancy ones
hold on
too many options
ice fishing‚•π‚Ä¶‚•πthis is a wonderful city
combating the issues of racism
solving climate change‚•π*claps‚•πfast internet at low costs
(not at all filled in with a blue highlighter)
tourism
transparent plane engines
you name it
we have it‚•πwow‚•πcheck that off
my entire essay is now a works cited‚•πFinally‚•πi see
in case you wanted to stay‚•πNah‚•πk‚•πI am doing other things
I mean I might just stay here and watch‚•πi like
reverted the repo it was a submodule in
and then it was gone
and now it throws websockets errors‚•πDon't use submodules
Pull the downstream JRunner5 and run it separately‚•πisnt it upstream?
idk i think i got it to work
but that was not the main issue
the main issue was that i have this whole network of remote origin nonsense
upstream remote
and whatnot
so like
git pull erases half my files
and i git pulled‚•πwhy is windows being annoying
its stuck at 10%
um
thats not good‚•πhow about
do not use submodules‚•πits not submodules
its like
i have a repository‚•πtry hg
this is what I do
I don't try fixing it
I use something else lol‚•πset as an upstream remote for another repository
which is a submodule for another repository
i dont like git
its too complicated
i swear shopify and mailchimp
are on like
every other dev tool website
ooo aaugustin replied to my GitHub issue
he has posted an entire guide on serverless hosting his websockets library on Heroku
cy likes github
its full of ppl who actually care
ramesh
remove the protobuf please
it is driving me insane
i have to deal with git submodules
in order to use it‚•πI have the confusion‚•πI do not have an answer, but why are you using internet explorer, or does WebAssign really look that bad‚•πwebassign is horrable
it is ugly af‚•πoh btw ramesh‚•πlike straight out of the 90s‚•πa. i made it work‚•πIts 12.1
How did i get there
I have no clue‚•πthank u akhil
I will try and figure out‚•πYes lemme know when u do‚•πIn some time, maybe‚•πok‚•πoh also akhil‚•πHola‚•πdid you wanna host a jrunner instance on ur server
no port forwarding needed‚•πUh sure
Im rn doing a rework of my lab enviroment
But once its up and everythings configured ill host it‚•πok
its pretty easy to host it
just like
git clone rameshs repo
then set 3 environment variables‚•πOkay ill do it later‚•πyeah‚•πTry making it a docker container
That would be cool‚•πthere is one issue though
which is that if the websocket connection breaks
it wont restart
wait
can you configure that in docker
like
if the process dies‚•πYea‚•πhow do u do that‚•πIm not entirely sure‚•πimma see‚•πill make
it
I have some experience with dockerfiles‚•πthis is actually very neccesary if im hosting on heroku‚•πI
will make this Jrunner5 dockerfile
don't worry‚•πyes
because you see
heroku
kills
your server
every 30 mins
if there are no new requests‚•πjust wait
give me 5 minutes‚•πim waiting‚•πill have a docker file‚•πdocker is really easy
its like
GET this
SET that
DIRECTORY there
RUN the thing‚•πi
am making a docker image now‚•πare you gonna add it to the repo
how does docker work again
.dockerfile
?‚•πI will tell you when I am done‚•πok‚•πi have a dockerfile
but it may not be the nicest thing in the world‚•πtbh idrc as long as it works
is it on github‚•πin a second
i want to test that it runs
what's the url
ok
give me a second‚•πwait
stop
dont
stop
stop‚•πwhy
*sigh
then I have to change the source code
right‚•πum
as far as i remember
jrunner5 already has the path‚•πyes‚•πthe right path
codetool‚•πlol‚•πlol
codetolol‚•πok
does it connect‚•πyes‚•πok
1 sec
pushed
not now
i have to read something for english‚•πwhat if you click on it
and then like‚•πi did‚•πunclick on it
ok you clicked on it
thx‚•πlol
should I write my own codetools
like unpolished bad-looking codetools
to see if I can write it in as few lines of code or less
not to compete with yours
no seriously
I just want to see how good I can make web dev‚•πi mean sure
but
it takes a
while
and
the api docs‚•πthe point is to write it in as few lines of code as possible
like
as fast as I can‚•πi mean that's what i did
it only took this long cuz i switched frameworks twice‚•πyeah im not gonna use react or any frontend stuff
maybe two api endpoints total‚•πwdym make your own codetools
without a frontend‚•πyes‚•πwhat does that mean‚•πno wait
1. im gonna write it in bash
2. the entire HTML will be echo calls
3. there will be a textbox for the code
4. the database is a text file
5. I will probably cry at the end‚•πum
uh
you do you‚•πyes
i will do me and do my homework‚•πi can be your api docs
if you need them‚•πlol ok
i mean i wrote jrunner5‚•πwhich you need‚•πno like
i want to make something that only uses jrunner5‚•πthat's not codetools then
thats like‚•πclonecodetools‚•πa jrunner5 frontend written in bash‚•πyes
and i have work to do
so this wont happen until like
june
since i have ap tests‚•πimma figure out that docker container
for a limited period of time
then go do my homework
bye‚•πbye‚•πhow to i install docker on linux
this works
I can kill the dyno
and it will auto reconnect
however
it only works on linux x86_64
wont work on windows
wont work on raspberrypi
how long is yours‚•πI haven‚Äôt started‚•πwhat
how‚•π*gulps sensibly*‚•πits due like
by tomorrow
we are doing a reflection thing tmrw
lol ok‚•πThis is what she said to me‚•πthen that's what it is
do you have a script?‚•πNo
I have all night tho‚•πlol‚•πWhat did u use
If u used slides can u show me
She never gave us any examples‚•πI did use slides
but
really fancy slides
not really slides‚•πCan I see them‚•πim exporting the video
hold on‚•πKk‚•πthe audio is really quiet‚•πUh where‚Äôs your map‚•πon the first slide
any other concerns
i need feedback
you speako frencho‚•πi speako frencho‚•πwatcho video and give meo feedbacko‚•πNo you need an actual map of the city
I thought‚•πum‚•πI asked her after class
bro she never clarifies anything‚•πmy dad told me if the teacher tells you you can do whatever you want, do whatever you want
they cant take points off then‚•πTour of ideal city
I asked her after class
She was going on about monuments, shops, location of city center
Email her‚•π*yawn‚•πBruj‚•πi might email her
i dont have an awful lot of time left to work on this
generally
i have math and chem and AP sem
oo it rhymes‚•πI spent the whole day doing apush
Now I‚Äôm rushing to finish French‚•πidk i think ill be fine
but maybe ill add an extra slide in there
i did it in powerpoint so adding another slide with audio is very quick
i dont have to re-record the whole audio
i have to eat dinner bye‚•πBud
Bye*
When is the professionalism due‚•πwhat is this
why
is it so damn colorful
WHERE IS THE SILVER AND BLACK
idk why u would get this either
the new ipads are alright
i didnt expect much from those
so its good
still pretty expensive‚•πI think they tryna turn into üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà‚•πHonestly yea
The macs look disgusting‚•πThe beginning of the ms paint map‚•πWHAT
FIRE THEM
FIRE THEM
WHO MADE THE BATTERY USER REPLACEABLE
I WANT THEM OUT
NOW‚•πYes‚•πTHIS WILL DESTROY OUR BRAND
IT WILL DESTROY OUR COMPANY‚•πNot even that
They made it replaceable for the wrong thing
If someone gets that tag they can remove the battery
Bam no tracking‚•πlol just like
smash it
no more tracking‚•πOr that
Fair
But user replaceable?
Damn‚•πthe new imacs look pretty nice from the back
idk from the front‚•πI dislike the front‚•πthey look a bit dated‚•πThat bottom bar thing
Is ugly‚•πyeah...
i like the idea tho
of the thinness
but it seems like its just meant to look bad next to the upcoming imac pro
that way you buy the pro
the ipad with M1
is
good
very good‚•πThats ehh‚•πfurther rubbing their thumb in the industry‚•πIt looks like an xdr display‚•πabout how good their chip is‚•πYea
Ipad is fine
That i can live with‚•πpurple iphone
yipee
tech
wow
high tech purple‚•πPurpl
Very purpl‚•πAirTag
um
good
cy like‚•πReally?‚•πyes‚•πIts expensive tho‚•πnot really‚•π30$ for one tracker‚•πthat's not much‚•πTiles r like 30$ for a couple
Huh
Then ig its fine‚•πtiles are not as feature
the thing is their implementation will probably be very good‚•πYea‚•πonce again their marketing proves very strategic‚•πWith find my‚•πi really like their marketing‚•πI like the app‚•πits fun to watch‚•πIts not bad
I dislike
That there is no black
Or space grey‚•πidk‚•πOn the imacs‚•πyou see tho how like
with that air tag‚•πSilver and space grey are what they r known for‚•πlocks you into the ecosystem‚•πYea
Once u have that
U need an iphone to use it‚•πthe ipad and the mac will soon merge

im still waiting
in pc land
for a response
to M1‚•πWell we shall see‚•πmaybe itll be NVIDIA
with their fancy stuff
and ARM
maybe itll be Pat Gelsinger
and his new plans
Maybe Lisa Su has something up her sleeve
i heard she wants to go into arm
maybe itll be google
but i dont think so
maybe microsoft
or maybe RISC-V will destroy ARM
then apple will be in trouble
because they have been ARM people
for a while
and if RISC-V beats arm
it will be very hard for them to migrate
honestly go risc-v

"Would you like the close button to minimize the application?"
"No, I would like the minimize button to minimize the application"
"Thank you very much"‚•πwell no its not like close minimizes stuff
it closes the app, but the app still stays in memory kinda

quality‚•πGatsby just works‚•πi added this little thing in the corner‚•πRamesh you are being very sus rn.
He is a confirmed hacker‚•π?‚•πI might add something to CodeTools‚•πwhat‚•πvim/emacs keybindings in monaco‚•πum
sure‚•πnot anytime soon tho‚•πas long as you make them opt-in‚•πi have
yes‚•πand make them easy to switch‚•πAP teststm‚•πoh also ramesh
on the docker‚•πno‚•πdo that
so it auto restarts‚•πi will when i deploy it on my server‚•πcuz like
heroku‚•πdies‚•πno‚•πi will do it when I run it on my server‚•πkills‚•πI know‚•πramesh is offline‚•πI stopped it‚•πim running one on the 4h server‚•πLike I said‚•πits the only place it would run‚•πI will put it on the docker registry
and I will add it to stuff‚•πadd compatibility before you do that
cuz it doesn't work on windows
or arm‚•πer
why‚•πidk windows threw like 5 different errors each time
different each time‚•πsend me the pi ones‚•πlemme see‚•πah
that isn't a me problem
that
is an openjdk problem‚•πOpenJDK does not run on arm?‚•πi will see
try changing the docker file
so the first line says‚•πlemme try hold on‚•πoh nvm
remove that
ur docker is broken
try
docker run hello-world‚•πwait
arm32
wait
what
oh its cuz like‚•πyes‚•πRaspbian is arm32‚•πyou should run aarch64 linux‚•πhow do i check what aarch
i am running
the hell
armv7?
32-bit?
what is this installation
raspberry pi is 64-bit armv8‚•πarm
aarch64‚•πwait‚•πraspbian is not aarch64
try that, perhaps‚•πits running
but without the :15
so idk‚•πi would test, but my pi runs freebsd‚•πlol‚•πso I  have to use jails‚•πomg this is so slow
to extract‚•πuse aarch64 linux
it will be faster‚•πlol that 4h server did it in like 2 seconds
first the install
then another 2 seconds for the build
it was like
fassssst
lol i think the pi's internet speed is faster than its disk speed

raspberry pi slow
the final icing for an app like codetools would be a service worker
that could cache all the pages
so they load in a snap
the problem is
what if i push an update
and the really fancy solution
is webpush
i tell vercel to webpush when there is an update
and then the service workers listen
and when they recieve the webpush
they all delete their cache
mind trying to explain this error
when i run on windows
your docker container
lol ok so it has to do with LF being converted to CRLF on windows
i believe there is a way to tell git specifically not to do this in a .gitattributes file
please do that ramesh
what
YES‚•πRight
That is a valid thing with CRLF
I will do it in some time‚•πok
i mean you can get it to work if you specifically tell git to not do conversions
in git config
but
that's not nice‚•πI will fix it in some time
I too have homework‚•πok
load "balancing"
much better‚•πconfuse
how cpu munh 334%‚•πlook at the CPU %‚•π*337‚•πno you take that and divide it by 12‚•πooooooooooooo‚•πcuz i have 12 cores
its weird‚•πthat is
i mean does it dist the load across the cores to begin with‚•πno its not that
so
each of the containers
is connected to managementWS
which doles out jobs
to the containers‚•πi must do chem test‚•πoh bye‚•πbye‚•πgl‚•πI bacc from chem test‚•πit not bad‚•πomg its so funny to watch my PE teachers try to do a kahoot
first they couldnt share a zoom link to the other meeting
then they couldnt focus the projector for the ppl in class
and they switched the input
and then they didn't share their screen
so the 60 ppl on zoom did not see the questions‚•πnot bad‚•πwhich bill wursts song should i use‚•πcy was taking kemistry kwiz‚•πah how was it?‚•πnot bad‚•πyea‚•πedulastic was being slow
and not responding
but
other than that

so i can try and answer then
omg alankar is so screwed on the precalc test
he didn't see the last problem
and didn't do it
otherwise i thought it was fine‚•πoooofffffff
rip alankar
was it like a big question
with many points‚•π4 pts‚•πeeeee‚•π42 pts total‚•πthat is gonna hurt
act‚•πand he got 2 other questions wrong‚•πnvm‚•πi think‚•πok so 12 pts off
30/42‚•πwell
i think the other ones were like‚•πthat is 70%‚•π3 pts
wait no
idk exactly‚•πbut still if it is 32/42 it is like 75%‚•πim trying to use the spotify web api‚•πwhat are u putting it in‚•πim making a spotify client
called
cpotify
i have the playback functionality working‚•πI solved world power‚•πYES
world power‚•πnow everything can be powerd‚•πlol
but
i mean
i solved that problem when i was 5‚•πrip‚•πwith gear ratios
i said
if i use gear ratios to make it faster
then
i spin with one motor
but then its faster
on the other motor
which is the generator
so we get more energy‚•πhahahahhaha
that is like electroboom infinite power molment‚•πlol
spotify has like 6 apis‚•πy 6‚•πthe whole thing is kinda weird
theres one for playback
one for control
one for data
and then other ones
probably one for artists‚•πbruhh‚•πone for ‚Ä¶.
i have the playback one workoing‚•πI mean in hindsite it makes things more efficent
cuz if u only need 1‚•πyeah‚•πbruhh\
I act kinda like that
I dont wanna do cp english
it is so easy‚•πlol do honors then‚•πand I pratically sleep in class‚•πyup‚•πi wish i did‚•πidek what we r doing‚•πneither do i‚•πonly works if u have premium tho‚•πyea im not gonna try‚•πthat is why it bork‚•πyes he did
also would 4gb ram be enough for windows 10?‚•πyeah
i mean
you will be using swap and compression almost immediately
but if ur cpu is not bad‚•πhmm okay‚•πmy english teacher took off a point for submitting an assignment 2 minutes late
it wasn't a timed thing either
like a long-term thing
and we had to get the last piece of it in class that day
so I submitted 2 minutes late
like WHICH teacher takes off points for submitting 2 minutes late for this kind of thing
and then she silently removed it later which is funny‚•πGente che parla italiano
mikaelo u shouldo joino
look at this quality software
this will be really easy with react‚•πCy can u kick me out of the chat and add me back it whenever I open the chat it says I have 2 @ ‚Äòs‚•πok‚•πLmao it‚Äôs still broken‚•πidk why
cant you like
mark as read
i think its swipe right or left
in the chats page‚•πI think I fixed it by pinning the chat‚•πok
quality
i like cpotify already
even though i can't seek
shhuhuhsh
we will have that functionality soon.
seeking is now a thing
and it looks really nice
at least what i have now
cpotify‚•πwhat is that for?‚•πWdym‚•πwhats cpotify?
just a pwa spotify client?‚•πYes but the idea is it will be actually good‚•πi mean the spotify pwa isnt half bad
its just like the app‚•πIdk imma see where I get with this one‚•πyea
i like the normal spotify clients cause u can use em without premium
which is nice
wait‚•πTrue‚•πif u have adblock
on a pwa like spotify‚•πLol‚•πwould that block ads?
nah it wouldnt‚•πIt could
Maybe‚•πwait it did
i just skipped like 30 tracks
an ad came up and then just skipped
i need to test this‚•πI think you have to listen to each one for more than 30 seconds‚•πi shall test it
i wanna know
if this is a viable way‚•πAlternatively if cpotify detects you don't have premium
It could just use YouTube as the source‚•πit could
cant it also just shuffle play ur playlists‚•πThe playback portion only works for premium users I think
But the rest of it
Like the controls and metadata and user data stuff
I don't think you need premium‚•πintresting
what
tf
is
that‚•πIt's an iPod dock üôÇ
*duck
this is exactly what im going to tell the next person who confuses java with javascript

This is one of the features I like about windows, as you know‚•πcan i miracast to android‚•πYou can Miracast to Samsung devices
Although it's a bit finicky
You can also Miracast to Windows‚•πcan you do it over WAN‚•πIt's wifi-direct‚•πi‚•πThere is no LAN/WAN‚•πi do have wifi‚•πIts p2p‚•πi need to set up wifi
can i use it over ethernet‚•πNo you need a wifi capable device‚•πfine‚•πActually it may need to be wifi-direct capable‚•π*sigh
how do I check‚•πBut I think that's most devices‚•πi have to install the wifi driver first tho
aka add a udev file
since my wifi adapter works with a driver
but the driver does not have the USB id
also i have to install bluetooth
I reinstalled linux‚•πIf you have a windows laptop
You can Miracast to that
If you wanna test
You open the Connect app‚•πI don't anymore
I installed linux on my windows laptop‚•πUm‚•πlol
let me get the goddamn wifi working‚•πIdk imma try this later‚•πbtw
wait
I gotta find it‚•π?
Also btw everyone here‚•πthe second one is the actual size‚•πI'm going rollerblading later‚•πthe first one
is the compressed size
i got auto fs compression‚•πCool
Do you wanna roller skate with me‚•πno‚•πWhy‚•πbecause I don't want to‚•πOk
Around 1:30‚•πAw I can‚Äôt I have a zoom thing‚•πI mean
When does that end‚•πProb like 4‚•πOh‚•πAt the latest‚•πOk
Well maybe another time then‚•πYup‚•πK‚•πI have confusion‚•πuh sig figs?‚•πyou do 0.5 * 1.5 M then you get 0.75 moles witch you convert by multiplying 142.05 g/mol of na2so4 to get 106.54
ooooo
so 106.5‚•πum
0.150 is 3 sig figs‚•π3
Yeah‚•πbut idk if thats the smallest amount‚•πwait so then 107 g‚•πyea try that‚•πrip‚•πUsually it tells you if SF is wrong‚•πit dident
idk what I am doing wrog‚•πsometimes it doesnt‚•πwrong
this is my work‚•πwhy 1.5 M
isnt it 0.150 M‚•πwait
ahhhhhhhhh
it is

i cant go to school tomorrow
i lost my wetip card‚•πi would lend you mine
but‚•πwho thinks my vpn will work tmrw‚•πwhat kind of vpn is it‚•πit is
port 51829 udp‚•πimma say 40% chance of working‚•πlol‚•πalthough‚•πwe shall see‚•πthey probably took down the firewall‚•πlol‚•πso idk‚•πthat would be funny‚•πill check if my proxy works‚•πand ill check if my vpn works‚•πi wanna make my own lighting console software‚•πthe thing is
it's not easy to turn off wireguard
cuz gnome suck‚•πi might be sick tmrw
which would not be good
wait
what if i made a css-style cascading language for lighting presets‚•πwhy would you be sick tomorrow
i mean
we all might be
so whatever‚•πno im like
tired
and
im 98.8
which is
a bit high
for me
and my eyes feel hot
just listening to some cpotify
the glow may be a bit to spread out
key and tempo
its funny i only knew i could access that data cuz the PE teacher showed us this website
for an assignment
but it said "data from Spotify"
so i was like
huh‚•πThis is a nice website
Its convenient as heck‚•πwell guess what
cpotify now does this
automatically
on every song‚•πNice
But that info isnt really useful
I dont even need the key
I only use bpm to set my metronome‚•πi like knowing the key‚•πMake it a setting‚•πbtw that's not all the data they give you‚•πLike musician mode
Where it add bpm key and whatever‚•πi could do that
i could also add like
a button
or a right click‚•πU could‚•πone of the things i like with spotify is the "show credits"
it shows me the label and the actual ppl who wrote it
you find interesting stuff in there‚•πThats intresting‚•πyou can see if this person wrote it solo
or if they were working with a production team
you also find interesting things like
i found that a lot of the music i listened to was from just a few labels
but like
smaller labels
like mom+pop and Elektra‚•πHuh
Yea no mine is def not
As expected‚•πi have heard of that one‚•πcy
wait
how‚•πIdk
I will ask my parent
In a moment‚•πwhat about the other one
did your other parent disappear
lol‚•πNo he's watching tv‚•πah‚•πDownstairs‚•πokay
understandable‚•πWait ramesh‚•πif ur proxy doesn't work u can use mine‚•πWhere was this said‚•πsame with Ramesh and his vpm
vpn‚•πFriday folder?
What day
K‚•πi bet it will
no one uses wireguard‚•πtrue‚•πand im using a custom port‚•πo then the school an't gonna find that‚•πas I remember
OpenVPN did not work on udp on a random port‚•πwhy
do they just block‚•πidk‚•πall udp‚•πhowever,
it worked on TCP port 443‚•π*sigh
ill have to test
also ssh is blocked‚•πwhy does that matter tho‚•πi cant ssh into my vps
and change the settings‚•πjust use the webssh‚•πno
ill use my phone‚•πor,

of my vaccine card‚•πif you want

maybe i will reconsider another time‚•πThat‚Äôs very random‚•πthat's very ramesh‚•πno
I just htink like
it might be a match‚•πnah‚•πhave you tried‚•πi have issues
which i will not go in depth about
which prevent me
at this moment
from engaging in that culture‚•πHah
well I am the same‚•πg l o w‚•πoh i have to do the stupid like
"COVID screening form"‚•πlol‚•πcan you tell me about this
quickly
and like
how the whole thing works‚•πok so‚•πhow they check
whatever‚•πhave your parent
sign in to genesis‚•πok
‚Ä¶ then‚•πthey are prompted with the form
then
they effectively say
you have no symptoms
and then
submit
and then
it works‚•πdo i have to do anything in school‚•πyes‚•πwill the covid police use an eye scanner‚•πno‚•πto detect i have done it right
jk‚•πyou go to genesis on your phone‚•π*sigh‚•πand you click "entrance pass"
and it has a number‚•πoh god
ok‚•πwhich is the same for everyone but ok
and if they do it it is green
if they dont do it
it is red
and they won't let you in‚•πah ok
ill
do that‚•πyou have to do it tomorrow morning‚•πyeah ik
i am‚Ä¶ somewhat versed in what happens‚•πwait
what
i have lunch with mr harvey‚•πyes‚•πi will be interacting with mr harvey
quite a lot
these coming weeks
i wish my laptop would get off stupid preview builds
but it wont
so im stuck with preview builds
yippee.‚•πImagine having to wake up early
Tf
Do you really
Is anyone in school yet‚•πI'm almost there
Meet me at the main entrance‚•πSame
I will try
Idk what is the main one‚•πLike in the front
Near the cafeteria‚•πYea there are two
Oh ok
Where in the car line are you‚•πI'm coming in from cedar hill‚•πOh
Yeah I dont
Ill do that next time
Im coming now
Im in‚•πI don't have lunch today
So no
Just send him a message on remind‚•πOk‚•πwow
telegram
works
discord does not
*.io does
and wireguard doesnt
so ill have to try 443
or go for openvpn‚•πI don't know anyone in PE
In my class
Ha
40%
Less than 50
I was right
Cy is sad
He wants to talk to someone
During PE
But no‚•πu dont know anyone?‚•πNot in my class‚•πinteresting‚•πI mean Samuel and a couple others are in the room
But not in my class
windows RDP doesn't work
it used to work
windows RDP supports using relays though
but idk if that will solve this issue
WebRTC works
this is 100% a port issue
check anything that is not 80 or 443
or like whatever the DNS uses
and it won't work‚•πHa just use a proxy
From ur pi
Also yea it is weird that unigram works
I think cuz the school blocks certain applications like discord
And messenger
But don't know about unigram....or cy chat
Wait no chat
Or whatever it is called‚•πnochat doesn't work
its on port 8080
cy2 browse works tho
cuz its on 443
yup its only 80 and 443 open
but i think i can get haproxy to make something work
i will see‚•πI mean the school doesent have any blocks up rn‚•πthey block all ports‚•πooooo‚•πcant discuss now‚•πwait I hav proxy on
woops
and sry‚•πvpn dead
lets make it work
im gonna iperf
443 udp‚•πI'm gonna use haproxy
hold on‚•πok we are on
time to open 443 and 80 udp
they also block 22
actually i can try dns‚•πthey block everything‚•πthe dns port‚•πexcept 80 and 443‚•πyes‚•πi tried‚•πi think‚•πi tested‚•πdns port is open
cy‚•πyes‚•πso I can run wireguard on the dns port‚•πwait i need to finish talking hold on
what is the dns port‚•πok bye
no
not bye‚•πno I'm back‚•πi have to use iperf‚•πwait
do you wanna call
i like talking‚•π53 usually‚•πWAIT lol
voice communication doesn't work
telegram voice chat
doesn't work
wait ramesh
ok
so
i am going to proxy my vpn through haproxy
over realvnc
trusty realvnc
never fails.‚•πhaha
im trying netcat
and then imma use a variety of ports to do that
ugh
how do I test udp ports
i have to use ssh over my PHONE
why in gods name‚•πuh oh
that failed...‚•πnah
it's blocked
blocked
jk
i think
the school
throttled me for trying nmap
nah im not on btsd‚•πwhat is nmap‚•πnetwork map
runs port scans‚•πim on the clock
this is painful
i need to find a better way to test
im pretty sure DNS port works tho‚•πu could use that‚•πwhat is it
67?‚•π53
i think‚•πyea
ur right‚•πthats what i used as a dns port for bind9‚•πill try it
wait
cy said minecraft port is open too
imma try that first‚•πoh‚•πwait‚•πthats‚•πbut thats tcp‚•πno
so
they allow
80 and 443
for all
but
allow specific ports
for specific outbound ips
so like
well so their dns is probably local
like in the router
but‚•πoh i see‚•πlike‚•πill try 443 first‚•πgoogle dns
is probably not blocked‚•πuh
443 works‚•πwdym‚•πon my phone‚•πvpn?‚•πyes wait‚•πI'm trying to get it to work‚•πwhy dont u guys try btsd_guest‚•πthere is only btsd_guest‚•πthey dont have btsd?‚•πidk
i can't see it‚•πI got kicked
From btsd
I think‚•πspoof ur mac‚•πI might have to change my mac
Yea duh‚•πno i don't have it either‚•πlooks like
they blocked 443 udp
lol
i forgot to change hte port‚•πI'm trying 443 tcp
but its not working
?‚•πlooks like 443 udp dead
i think
they are blocking
dns‚•πi need to figure out how to get OpenVPN to work‚•πwait
i think
dns is not blocked
imma try
you can arbitrarily connect to dns
no what
ok back on btsd
443 udp blocked
53 should work‚•π53
huh‚•πimma try
give sec‚•πimma try too‚•πi look like im hacking rn
which is perfect‚•πlol‚•πhuh
it is
blocked
it is like‚•πits like‚•πthey are checking what kind of traffic‚•πnot throwing that error
but
its not connecting
wait
ramesh
can you change the domain of your vpn
without changing the keys‚•πwdym domain‚•πlike where it is‚•πyes‚•πok‚•πive done it before‚•πso i just need a port that works
hold on‚•πlol i didnt
change
port‚•πwait
have you gotten anything working
at all
ramesh‚•πwait
wait
wait
just wait i may be onto something‚•πok‚•πhuh
so it blocks by traffic too
how‚•πidk
lol‚•πno
wait‚•πik‚•πHUH
wait‚•πwhat‚•πit works
not really
yep
im on vpn
HA
port 53 WORKS‚•πtcp?
or udp?‚•πwait
udp port 53‚•πok lemme try that‚•πmy image wont upload tho
:(
there
it uploaded now
lets GO‚•πnot working for me‚•πit works for me‚•πi probably configured something wrong‚•πyes
it works 100% for me
check your firewall‚•πwait ur using wireguard‚•πyeah
i am accessing discord‚•πI'm on openvpn‚•πright now
ovpn uses tcp right
just use 443 in that case‚•πno
you choose
its udp by default‚•πmake sure nmap
works‚•πhow do you nmap‚•πthat might not work‚•πis it there by default
nmap‚•πon windows idk
wsl u have to install
probably‚•πalso ramesh‚•πwhat‚•πmeet me by the front entrance
when school ends‚•πyea‚•πwe will go to the nurse‚•πim walking home
also‚•πand walk‚•πyep‚•πI'm installing nmap
imma try it
if it doesn't work‚•πalso cy‚•πimma try on mobile data‚•πbtsd
might be hidden SSID‚•πit probably is
wait
WAIT‚•πdoes it work
it works for me‚•πno for me it acts as WPA-Personal
not WPA-Enterprise‚•πbtw michael
my VPN works‚•πooooo‚•πalso I saw yu in the hallway michael‚•πwhat port did u use‚•π53
DNS port
im smart right‚•πy 443 not work‚•πudp‚•πo
I mean
u could have gone the dumb way
and use a proxy on ur pi‚•πthis is faster‚•πi tried nmap
in wsl
it doesn't work‚•πshow me ur speedtest michael‚•πok‚•πignore it
just
try connecting anyway
yea‚•πno it won't connect‚•πthats a wsl thing‚•πeither‚•πum
do you want me to scan for you‚•πwdym‚•πi can try nmap‚•πI think speedtest is breaking my pi‚•πis my ip‚•πvpn off‚•π53 port
?‚•πok wait
i turned off my vpn
since nothing is blocked on the vpn‚•πlol‚•πit's up for me‚•πmy ip?‚•πyes
it is sending an image
ok so discord works if you already have it open‚•πwait‚•πthey did a bad job of blocking discord
lol‚•πthat's tcp
i have the vpn set to udp‚•πüëè‚•πno i tried tcp as well
hold on lemme try again‚•πtry
udp
53‚•πthat is what is not working
and what did not show up in your nmap‚•πtry udp‚•πi just did‚•πand‚Ä¶
it didnt work‚Ä¶
?‚•πlemme do it again‚•πdo it again
mine works 100%
did you
open the port
what else does the school block
other than discord‚•πyes
this is where it gets stuck‚•πtry
wireguard‚•πidk how‚•πit's faster‚•πhow do i try wireguard‚•πyou have to generate a public key and private key on your server
public key and private key on client
and do 5 lines of config
that i copied from somewhere‚•πhow to i use wireguard
tell to me‚•πu dont even need to generate keys on both the client and server‚•πthe commands‚•πidk‚•πi have 5 minutes‚•πon windows‚•πno server-side‚•πtheres a gui on windows‚•πi just made a server key and then let my clients have said key‚•πserver side idk on windows
ik how to do it on linux‚•πwdym
my server
is a pi
i need the commands to install it‚•πok
wait
here
just copy that
this one seems right
But change the port to 53‚•πhey ramesh
so its working sorta
so the first thing
that does not work
instead
i run wireguard on 51820
and then forward port 53 on the router
to 51820
so then i connect
then i do an address scan
then i port scan that ip
and i find all the ports of my pi
so it is working
but
it is not actually sending Internet requests
i have to go to drama club
but if you find anything
lemme know
this time I installed it with pivpn
so it should work
but idk maybe its conflicting with openvpn
maybe i should use docker
idk
i gtg‚•πhi i
didnt see it
iptables? idk
should I run a wireguard for all of you
i might get into more trouble
it would take
two lines of code
to add anyone who's interested
but it might cut our bandwith‚•πhow do I convert an svg file to an inline svg file cuz im workin on a website for my portfolio in gatsby‚•πum
calum did that
idk how to‚•πok ima ask calum‚•πok‚•πah discord
is getting funny‚•πI figured it out
its called
OSC‚•πyuh ramesh sent me weird question‚•πits how I will talk to eos
bye‚•πyes
you really think‚•πlol‚•πlets just say ramesh is having some fun
play along if you want‚•πcy has figured it out
for real
it works
now
all I need to do is emulate a knob or something
so I need to get a python websockets server working
which I already have
then a websockets client working
that can transmit accelerometer data
which I already have
then the server needs to send OSC commands
to eos‚•πthe funny thing is that no one can do a really good job of being me
you can try
.center {
    display: grid;
    place-items: center;
  }
no way‚•πYeah but flexes are better‚•πlol‚•πwireguard works
and it works very well‚•πwireguard is nice
i like it
ikev2 is also not bad
but its super annoying to set up‚•πstop
i don't want to know what's better than wireguard
i have this
i am happy‚•πpretty sure its the best
so ur good‚•πok‚•πcy do u hav lunch period 8‚•πGym sux
Already‚•πlol
have fun‚•πthey said they're going to like badminton or something
so it should be fine‚•πlol
meet me at the main entrance
after school
and we can walk‚•πNo
I have to go home early
For physics retake
So im using the bus‚•πOk
STUN
yes
i know what that is
I had to use it in WebRTC
although the WebRTC system deals with it all for you
but yeah it essentially allows you to figure out what is and is not blocked
so i would presume fancy vpns like nordvpn
use something like STUN to figure out which ports/protocols they can use
and then ensure that they will work
dammit
the Sensors API requires a secure context

how can i trick it into thinking it is running in a secure context

doge
it would make u more money

cuz I wanna sell my stock before new capital gains tax stuff‚•πah wait
yea thats a thing‚•πcuz then I would be taxed like 80%‚•πuh‚•πand Im like bruhh‚•πtechnically
cant u open like a roth ira account and put the money into it
so it doesnt get taxed
or was it real estate‚•πi have tried that, BUT, i need like a stable job and i only have a summer job‚•πu can put the money into something to avoid the tax
true‚•πi have a 529 tho‚•πyea i think so as well‚•πso i put monee in mutual funds and it go up
and it no tax‚•πor
u could put it into a market fund
and let it grow‚•πyea, that is my plan with my 529‚•πthat also would make money but idk bout tax
yea go for it
wasnt it 11/15% tax?
or did they increase it‚•πplan, ima sell a bunch of stock and buy rocketlab before ipo, and in the process buy 1k worth of doge
they did‚•πugh
not bad
i would be careful of the ipo

This is the coolest thing I have seen you do.
Since almost blowing up the PAC the night of the show...
ok...
proceed‚•πhow‚•πhow. um
lets see‚•πi want to figure out the percentage of each class‚•πUm
U need data‚•πwdym each class
like
freshman/sophomore/junior etc‚•π-freshman
since none of them qualify‚•πok
um
so
if you want
you can ask
to post a poster
with a qr code
ppl can scan
and say if they are vaccinated or not‚•πOr u could do the very very annoying thing and start an email chain‚•πYES‚•πYup just throw a google form in it and watch the world burn‚•πdistributed computing
to the next level‚•πOr
Wait nope u cant do that‚•πor you could ask the nurse‚•πU can just ask the nurse for covid vaccine statistics‚•πsay its for a study‚•πWell
Isnt it protected info‚•πit is if its per individual
but
if you just ask for broad numbers
and percentages
that is not protected‚•πYea then just do that‚•πalthough it might be a bit difficult
idk if they wanna provide that data
or if they have time to get it‚•πI think this
But if u say its for a study they might‚•πtbh I'm not that interested in this
but if Ramesh is actually that interested
go ahead and ask
it won't hurt‚•πYea
See what the nurses say
They prob can give u the percents u want‚•πakash wanted to set up a vpn

would you let akash connect to your wireguard
I told him you were about to let me
so I said you might let him
wait

wait
is it back for you‚•πAh
Ill log in‚•πWhy does it say action needed?

?‚•πit gave up‚•πWait‚•πmschapv2
what do I put for this‚•πConsidering the schools security and how lack luster it is
Um wpa?

Idk
Its last 4 digits‚•πyea
ur dad is gonna be mad‚•πSo they really cant do anything
Nah
His cards been leaked before‚•πah
my parents would get mad‚•πAs long as there is no charges on the card he cant reverse
He doesnt really care
Which they cant do anyway
They dont have cvv or full card number
Ill prob close the account anyway‚•πsocial commentary be like‚•πYup‚•πyeah I tried connecting and it doesn't work
there is no BTSD rn
although it did this sometimes last year
randomly
so maybe it's just a today thing
maybe tomorrow it will work
idk
Ill just use LoRaWAN for my internet connection
100 bits/second ftw
what does that mean
for you
do you have to go to the bus‚•πno
im not going to‚•πok‚•πdocker‚•πthat thing has 16 cores
it would be fun to make it go to 1600% cpu usage
btw my load balancer works now
so it will not send all the jobs to one jrunner
it will distribute them equally amongst all the jrunners

not that interesting
No
Also it's too windy anyway‚•πIts very windy
Idk why‚•πI have created a masterpiece‚•πjrunner5 could run on wasm
that would be really interesting‚•πit would
but it would not work for codetools‚•πit would‚•πno the checking/running has to be server-side‚•πit will be a binary so not super easy to cheat
if you can cheat you are probably qualified enough to not use codetools‚•πlol
but its not good practice‚•πeh‚•πto do things that can be hacked‚•πNVIDIA vGPU can be hacked‚•πalso you dont hack the binary
you hack its output‚•πtrue‚•πalso its not a binary
its wasm‚•πidk much about wasm but it sounds like some kind of compiled thing‚•πwasm is a higher level assembly code i believe
its like
assembly that can be compiled for multiple architectures
you actually transcompile to wasm
then
the wasm is compiled into a binary at runtime
by the browser
but since its essentially 90% compiled already
that compile time is fairly short
hi
I need help‚•πu mean

not 48.01

Third?
Cause the first one doesnt pass
False || false
Which is false‚•πsee i was like
nothing prints‚•πI could be very wrong‚•πbecause
true || true
is true
and true && false
is false
so the first one doesn't pass
and the second one doesn't pass
but
&& comes before ||
so
the second one is
true || true && false
which is
true || true
which is true‚•πNice‚•πluckily "nothing prints" was not an answer
which makes me even more confused
but at least i didn't get it wrong
well idk actually‚•πYea luckily‚•πi might have gotten it wrong
by missing something else
but like

smh i hope there isnt anything else i need to know that they didn't teach us‚•πTerraforming mars‚•πAh smart

it just has to be 2 paragraphs right?

im dying
i need ideas‚•πWrite about

So like explain that‚•πI could
i was thinking
i did a topic for that informative speech we did a while back
about living life in the moment
i can right something similar‚•πYea and do like an inspire thing‚•πunder the guise of inspire
yup‚•πDog‚•πthat
is a fluffy doge‚•πIndeed‚•πah i should buy some doge now

i clicked help
clicked documentation

Abreviated as C I S‚•πidk why does that seem like
idk
hold on
ok so i guess that's what it is
alright
ok
they updated the spotify desktop app

Its so nice
Idk man
Apush is wack‚•πcy is apcs that long
I dont think so
my mom forced me to do cp history in 9th grade
so i could not do apush in 10th‚•πYea the course itself isnt that bad‚•πi wish i could b in apush cuz like i am sleeping in hush‚•πThe ap test is long
My other one is not as long‚•πis it like dbq city‚•π1 dbq
1 leq‚•πu take 2 aps‚•π50 mc
3 saq
Yea‚•πbruhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
i would die
what u take‚•πApush and aphug‚•πsick‚•πYup‚•πyuh cuz u no get apcs
did u do like ur credits and stuff‚•πBut apcs isnt that bad
Yea
I will have at the end of this year
Besides fin lit‚•πif u taken 2 aps then how u hav room in ur schedule to do the credits this year‚•πApush is my history
Aphug is an elective‚•πooooo i ment like art credits and stuff‚•πYea thats my elective
Animation + photoshop‚•πooooooooo‚•πYea its nice‚•πin 9th grade i got screwed over for my electives cuz my gym period was wack‚•πAh same‚•πso i had to take art credits this year‚•πBut i got mine fixed‚•πyea, i emailed the ppl and they were like, no can do‚•πReally?‚•πyea‚•πOn the first day i was like‚•πlike the first day i got my schedule‚•πIm missing an english, math and gym period‚•πo lol‚•πAnd they fixed mine‚•πi was j not able to get a second elective for the second semester bc of some weird thing with my gym
i had all of my classes
so i had to take a study hall‚•πAh damn
I had two full years last year so it worked out‚•πdude
ppl in my Italian class
dont know basic stuff like pranzo being lunch
and this is supposed to b honors
I am face planting‚•πokay
is that a large indent?
its 2cm
idk if its too large or its fine‚•πits fine, also what u applying to‚•πi went for treasury
comp sci club‚•πoooooooo
i am sec tres for deb8 next year‚•πoh nice‚•πbut like i dont attend comp sci club as much as I should
as well as tec‚•πwell thats expected‚•πcuz like it conflicts with deb8‚•πdebate takes a lot of time
yea‚•πalso akhil
for the English thing
like the project
did u start‚•πnope‚•πok
cuz i thought i was gonna b alone cuz teacher lady said i hav to start by the beggning of the month‚•πyea no
we have a month
and u need to do it for like a week
so imma do it in a couple of weeks‚•πwhat u doin for it\‚•πto get back into photography
a super super easy
topic to do‚•πlol, mine is to get back into viola
i think i went overkill
and i am regretting it‚•πyea that might be overkill
i chose photograph y
because i can just use pictures i have already taken
and use those‚•πhahahhaa‚•πwhy
this is so useless
it's not
if you put in your address
1. download
2. rickroll‚•πI do‚•πcan u send‚•πnrn
l8r‚•πok
cuz that was fun last year
and we doin something like that in hush rn
they ruined stem123‚•πpowerpoint is nice‚•πFancy‚•πfancy indeed
also cy
for the ap calander thing
I get json errors
idk what bork‚•πI‚Äôm the person in the background‚•πlol
that shirt funny‚•πHey
For the Apush exam tire
Tmrw*
Does anyone know if we ha e to bring some Covid Form or the ticket
To the exam room‚•πidk anything about what is required nor do I take apush, but I would say it would b wise to be safe and take the school covid form(like the thing u use to get in on genesis) and the testing ticket.‚•πYea
And an id
We dont have testing tickets‚•πlol Akhil wake up at 430‚•πYup
I woke early
And now im outside the school waiting to get picked up‚•πhow was apush‚•πNot bad‚•πI see
where are matt and sam
they are supposed to be in my french class‚•πWe just got dismissed so‚•πok
oh here they are‚•πOkay i actually like this now
I get to skip 7th pd‚•πyeah
i didnt‚•πluckey‚•πcomp cy‚•πcyfinfaza was not at comp cy because reasons
pwobably dwama cwub‚•πI hab deb8 üòû‚•πhi‚•πit's windows‚•πoooooooooooooooo
thank u cy
ooooo ur old nextcloud server
this biden guy is killing my stonks
my Italian class has become fight club‚•πoh god‚•πyea
stonks ded‚•πoh god‚•πand that
we are not learning anything anymore an it is just a roman duel
with trivia questions‚•πhaha‚•πMicrosoft edge is mad
what is this mysterious "Fortinet"‚•πthat
is usually a thing games use as anticheat‚•πMicrosoft edge does not like the firewall
wait
they are changing the windows font
i just realized the fonts on my computer look a little different than they did before
just slightly
and there's a new font preinstalled on my computer
called Segoe UI Variable
its like
a blend
between segoe UI and Fira sans
much more segoe tho
not sure what i think of it‚•πthat‚Äôs amazing
I think this is also pretty cool‚•πlol imagine that's matts
that would be really funny‚•πooooo
y u need 2060‚•πi need one
vgpu_unlock
gtx 780 is awful
i think theres a bar error‚•πI got a 2060 because 
a.) it‚Äôs not insanely expensive
b.) it does what I need it to‚•πhow much is it?
also charles are you in my gym class‚•πyeah
lol‚•πi feel like i saw someone that looks like you
lol interesting‚•πwhy is this wrong?
(37.1 * 4.184 * (147.0-10.0))*1000‚•πis that
renai circulation or something‚•πIdk if I can work on it today
She said we have Monday and Tuesday‚•πOh ok I thought it was due tomm‚•πWait
We should check‚•πI‚Äôll try to get most of the data in‚•πOk
If you do that then I can start making graphs
And processing the data
See I might have time today
But I have to do the HAL timed write prewrite and like 2 or 3 webassigns
And my family wants to go to liberty state park
Also I tried to check but I don't think she posted anything on it
I just remember her saying that she was going to be a "generous dictator" and provide us with 2 extra days next week‚•πliterally no one: 
windows: mmm yummy license‚•πright
that's a thing‚•πThat script is so useful‚•πyea
it even does office‚•πcan you send me it‚•πHow?
Does it give ur account an office license or just activate it on the pc‚•πi think single pc but i havent checked
i can check tho‚•πI have started‚•πYea i am curious
YES
YES‚•πto the moonnnn‚•πthe problem is that nvidia GRID is a bit laggier now
i have to disable FRL‚•πHow much u gonna buy?‚•πidk, ima put 10 bucks in j to try it out‚•πtf is this‚•πHAHA‚•πI was thinkin bout that‚•πwelcome‚•πIt does all windows versions as well‚•πok imma disable FRL and change to 2q profile
on xen
thats so much easier‚•πDo u need doge core or can u trade on a public exchange thing like coinbase?‚•πu can use bolth
what I found was that td ameritrade did not soupport cryptos‚•πIntresting‚•πand I dident wanna do something like coinbase‚•πYea it doesnt‚•πand with core I can mine‚•πIdk the commission they take
Wait
Yes‚•πand u can acc get dogecoins bc they are not as big‚•πImma mine doge‚•πas like btc
yeaaaa
i gtg
bye‚•πAdios‚•πdo you have clubhouse‚•πnope‚•πdo you
want clubhouse‚•πnope
what is it exactly‚•πidk‚•πi thought it was kinda like houseparty‚•πironically i have no idea what it is
anyhow looks like I ran out of vram since the qemu dm script is scuffed
I love the heaven music‚•πLunacy‚•πLol I already got my first dose last week‚•πoh
lol
do yu love bill gates‚•πNah
More of an elon guy‚•πlol
but like
bill gates love vaccine
he put microchip
i love bill gate‚•πHahahaha‚•πi got two vaccine
i have twice the number of microchips than you
haha
i am cooler because i have more microchips‚•πSad‚•πunigine heaven‚•πI want microchips‚•πin a virtual machine‚•πOoooo
That run p well‚•πyea
NVIDIA vGPU‚•πDo u hav windows 10 pro‚•πyes
i
activated it
this‚•πhhahaha
u pirate‚•π"Pirate"‚•πlol‚•πAnd GH is microsoft
so technicall lmao
I just
I downloaded all of this software to activate windows from Microsoft
thats ironic‚•πhahhaha, putting the microchips to use‚•πyes billy gates will be proud
i need to buy a GTX 770
I need to take them from you
this is a bit expensive ngl‚•πI have a quadro‚•πwhat‚•πLike a really old one‚•πversion
no I want to know what
model
i may be interseted‚•πQuadro FX 1800‚•πlol too old
i need a gk104 gpu‚•πI come back hours later to check the progress of the doge and this is what I get
sync rate = supa slow
Shiba not happ
I found skechy thing online now im going Shiba speed‚•πwait how?
mine is still at like 2%‚•πso like before u can mine stuff u have to import the blocks‚•πyea update the blockchain‚•πwell there is a file u can download and it giv blocks
so then u j have to sinc them‚•πoh damn
imma do that
aslo what software u gonna mine with‚•πidk‚•πall of them look really sketch‚•πyea
what were u thinking of using‚•πi was gonna use cgminer
but i couldnt find a download link
so i then i went to nethash or whatever its called but it doesnt mine doge‚•πbruhh
i was looking at yt videos
and j seeing what ppl use
reditt coming in cluch
they say mine eth‚•πyup‚•πand swap for doge‚•πreally‚•πyuh‚•πi saw alot of people say mine litecoin
and mine both at the same time
mining eth might be better honestly
doge seems hella complex to mine‚•πyea im looking at stuff for eth rn
and yea doge is crazy‚•πnethash
it has a dashboard and everything‚•πooooooo‚•πi think the downside is that it pays out in bitcoin
which is weird
idk exactly how it works‚•πi mean can u buy doge with btc‚•πmine using a pool\‚•πyeaa‚•πif u find a really nice eth miner lmk‚•πok‚•πi cant find anything decent that isnt malware‚•πsame‚•πyo
do you know what nicehash is‚•πits like cool crypto miner‚•πthey
opened an issue‚•πsoftwere‚•πand they're a company
they should be paying
this thing is to like circumvent nvidia licensing LMAO‚•πhaha‚•πlmao‚•πthey got a nice lookin website and everything‚•πI told Krutav to tell them to screw off‚•πyea‚•πAnd we have nothing to do with companies
looks like im actually involved with this project now‚•πhahahah‚•πyes the one time i decide to get into open source
it is for some project that borders on illegal‚•πhaha‚•πlolll‚•πalso
they use arch
which is intersting‚•πi think ima use a cryptotrader
this is getting sketch‚•πi might just use nicehash honestly‚•πwhen they openly say they want to violate license agreements
id be concerned‚•πand get payout in btc‚•πit makes it more sketchy since they dont care‚•πthen invest into doge
yea‚•πyea‚•πthey apparently did that on an official nvidia repo too which is funny‚•πthat might be best
imma still mine tho
it gets u a few dollars‚•πhi I changed my profile‚•πnice
fancy new pf‚•πI am changing it everywhere
except
it will be different colors
telegram gets light blue
discord gets purple
g-suite gets teal‚•πdont u just love bash‚•πWhy would they not
Its elon‚•πSoon I can buy a space launch‚•πYup
Now it will truly be
‚ÄúTo the moon‚Äù‚•πHahhahahahah‚•πExcept not the moon part‚•πbetter‚•πThats alot of parameters‚•πit gets the process id from an rsyslog log‚•πIm trying to open a mobile wallet but u need id for all that
Which is annoying
U need all that
Damn‚•πthere
there
take that back
key word
dont use bash‚•πI find it funny that if you set Microsoft edge's search engine to the far inferior "google" it brings up automatic results while typing
apparently this person does not actually exist
this program just generated it using AI
cy drags the "navigation" ui component into lunacy
entire computer comes to a halt‚•πthat
website‚•πThats an intresting website
Ive seen a lot of them do it but not with that little artifacting
Looks kinda realistic‚•πits not a website‚•πmy gpu cant mine
i think my mac can prob mine but i aint gonna mine using it‚•πWaaaaaaa
cy is making clones of ppl‚•πis pfizer stock a good buy in your opinion‚•πmy mom owns some, I haven't looked at biotech stuff
but ima look into it
probably tho cuz like they b making gud vaccines for ppl all around the world
but the us gvmt would b like well I paid for the dev
so idk‚•πBut u gotta be careful
Hedgefunds might also do a good ol manipulating the market
Like dogecoin during elons snl skit thing
It dropped 29% when it was predicted to rise‚•πyea
also I hav confoose
like the things no mach
nvm I think I am dislexic
when copying the equation on paper I like mushed 2 givens together‚•πoops‚•πyes
download on itunes
lets go back to the stone ages‚•πI am so pissed, I got 3 pts off from my chem test
cuz of sig figs
i could hav had an a‚•πidk
I havent done that webassign
imma try it hold on‚•πfml it doesn‚Äôt want the negative‚•π?‚•πits 211.4‚•πok that's weird
idk how you get that
if I negate the first
and double the second‚•πyeah it‚Äôs broken‚•πi should do that webassign
but
i still have precalc
and French audio log‚•πAlso sry for l8 response‚•πnp I got it‚•πi joined comp sci
is anyone talking‚•πi was trying to
just move somewhere else
hopefully that would set an example
yes, ping everyone
big brain time
oh no‚•πthe sinc has completed
the mining can begin‚•πwhat GPU‚•π...baby 1060‚•πhow long did urs take?
im still on 35‚•πlike a few days‚•π3GB 1060?‚•π6‚•πu dont need to even mine‚•πSAME
lol‚•πhahahaha‚•πu get payed for folding@home‚•πare you serious
serious?‚•πrly‚•πyea‚•πrly
show me‚•πif u join the team‚•πimma get on it‚•π^‚•πi can vGPU
so‚•πdude do they accept doge
dude
sdf
sdf
sdf
sf
]f
sd
gfsd‚•πyes
YES dude
yes my dude‚•πso run that and make some extra change while ur at it‚•πthis is best‚•πYUH.‚•πidk payout
but honestly i dont mind
i always have folding running anyway‚•πsame‚•πthis gets me some money for it‚•π...in dogeeee‚•πyea its dead simple
set ur identity to ur wallet
and join the team
get payed in doge‚•πwait my doge address is too long it says
DHtE43fLCXhoqn16XAzL7ksFJm4yh8smZD‚•πreally?
i was able to set mine‚•πlike where u find it‚•πthe address?
file much reciving address‚•πyea, it said it was too long‚•πu dont need the #‚•πooo
now I b making doge‚•πVaccinated
Ppls
No
Have to wear masks
Hmm‚•πyea I j read ardicle on that
sad that I only hav 1 shot‚•πSo but hmm
Like skool
U get second eventually
Then freedomz‚•πlol the lunchroom mask gestapo cant touch this‚•πwhere is this article
i am almost fully vaccinated
ok no that's the CDC
thats not NJ
or Bernards BOE‚•πyea, but NJ gonna prob adopt it soon‚•πNJ and Bernards BOE have to say its ok first‚•πsame with boe
yuh ik
but they go off of cdc reccomendation‚•πtrue
my mom sent me some MIT robotics competition livestream thing‚•πso they prob hold like a hearing and maybe at the end of school no mask
oooo
ima keep that in my background while I study for chem‚•πreddit be like now the antivaxxers are going to wear masks to defy cdc rules‚•πHahahaahha‚•πlol
thats actually not a bad future
vaxers get their vaxes and dont wear masks
which is fine
and antivaxers get no scary vaxes
but they wear masks
Cy trying to flash a numworks‚•π?
Ive never seen mine do that‚•πidk
it worked tho now
so‚•πWhat did u flash on it?‚•πomega
but
with numworks theme‚•πAh i see‚•πhonestly whoever thought to make the theme for a yellow calculator red‚•πI forgot how that looks
Idk
I made my own theme which is like omega but more color variation‚•πidk i like the original numworks theme
it appears I am finally going to get in touch with rfidgs
the CEO said she would call with me tomorrow when she could get the software guy
mouser sells intel CPUs
like
not desktop ones
laptop ones
FCBGA-1449‚•πlol and cy dont study for chem test
it would have been funny if u changed it to raidians cuz I would not have changed it back and I would b doing all my math stuff in raidians‚•πChange it to polish‚•πmy calculator when it turn to polish‚•πi hate the new discord logo‚•πLol wtf is this‚•πi hate it‚•πIt's like
Slightly different‚•πworse.‚•πIn the wrong way‚•πnot different
yes
send this to Mrs. Tan and get it on the board in the comp sci room
this is
great
I honestly
there are people who send balloons with flyers into north korea
since they think it will liberate them
then people are mad that south korea is destroying civil liberties by prohibiting this
now THINK about it.
people
are sending.
flyers.
over an INTERNATIONAL border.
to ANOTHER country.
and that is apparently
destroying civil liberties by preventing this
this is like saying "I'll lob a box of chocolates over the border between the US and Canada" and thinking that is legal‚•πThats stupid
Exactly
Its an international border
There is a reason borders exist
No a better example is ill throw a box of chocolates from mexico to the us‚•πEh yea but with even more tension
India to Pakistan‚•πYea thats no bueno
Intresting‚•πthis gc died
unironically dead‚•πCause there is a lot of people‚•πfor what‚•πthis should b ur comp sci final project
j trying to get this on the bored
board‚•πOoo
I wanna know how much u made‚•πsame
I haven't gotten anything
but the thing says late saturday‚•πI had to shut off my server so it didnt do anything‚•πdude the doge
u need to make sacrifices‚•πYes
I will turn it back on
Wait i cant
But i am curious‚•πw8 y u hav to turn off server‚•πLemme know how many points u contributed and how much u got‚•πi contributed 65500 so far‚•πIm packing stuff to go into storage
Damn‚•πi mean it is only while im on my computer‚•πIdk mine was folding with a 710 and 4 virtual cores
So it wasnt contributing alot‚•πhow much u contribute‚•π0
I forgot how slow it is‚•πrip‚•πIt couldnt even get through one work unit
I could fold using my mac
That would get me a decent bit i think‚•πbut that means mac slow and overheat‚•πExactly
So i dont really wanna‚•πima go study for comp sci
bye‚•πGl‚•πthx‚•πshould I try folding on a GRID VGPU‚•πDo it
Im curious bout performance
Actually
Can u mine with it?‚•πyes‚•πOoooo‚•πyea that would b rly intrsting to see‚•πi just bought an 8gb pi‚•πooooooo
i also hav one
that is running my proxy
what u gonna use it for
ima prob get 0.014 doge
1 whole cent
but next week ima get 2 cents
cuz this week it was only mining for half a week‚•πlol
what u do michael is
and then wait for the doge value to go up or whatever
and then sell it‚•πthat is for normies
well, that means i am a normie
ut o
dude in 2 years i will make 1 doller‚•πdude i gotcha
just
take a visit to the bank of america
with lots of guns
and a few battering rams
and a few friends so you can party afterwards with lots of beer‚•πhahahahahaha,
best way to get doge
the only inconvience tho is the fbi, but that is like supppppper minor‚•πyea or just storm the capitol and sell the stuff u loot on ebay
even easier
it only took a few minutes to get in‚•πhahahahhah fax‚•πDamn‚•πcy is learning about machine learning
the natural intelligence is training its neural network on the artificial intelligence's neural network
Hi i added Benjamin Chee
he has free tomato plants‚•πHello everyone!
(I'm Benjamin)
Free tomato plants, any takers?
Just tell me y/n and how many
I'll deliver them my 6/15‚•πMy mom said she would take 2-4
Depending on whether other ppl want them‚•πI was doing the practice thing for comp sci and was like, what if I use an arraylist for this and make it super overcomplicated, well it worked
wait no it failed
i was looking at my other method‚•πare they grown already?‚•πwhat is this error‚•πidk‚•πthe evolution‚•πI am the error
Jkjk
Got it üôÇ
Yep!‚•πi swear to god
if that was the wrong practice test
imma f|‚•πcy wtf
howwwwwww
I got a 30/40 and I was like happy‚•πNgl i would probably get a 39
Being completely honest
Hmm I might be interested on munching on some then‚•πI did the retry one
But it should be the same, right?
Like difficulty wise‚•πyea, also there are 2
cuz if so ima do that other one monday‚•πi have a moderate headache rn
idk why
i may or may not be able to come into school tmrw
if it persists‚•πI got my second dose yesterday
i was like not that dead‚•πi got my second dose 10 days ago
the day after mine i was not dead but i got a short headache‚•πyea, i j had a small headache the whole day‚•πidk like suddenly im having all these headaches after the vaccine‚•πlol the microchips are attaching themselves to ur neurons‚•πlol yes
why on earth did I let the Russians implant such devices in me
they are out to kill me‚•πidk, i think they j wanna make us buy their vodka when we older ngl‚•πlol
machine learning is cool btw‚•πyea, what were u running
i wanna learn about that stuff‚•πi am establishing a basic understanding
what i was running was a demo
that allowed the computer to identify rock/paper/scissors from an image‚•πooooo, so like the nvidia software
also what does it run on
like do u need a special environment‚•πso this is using TensorFlow
and it was running on Google Colab‚•πoooo
next weekend or potentally like after the ap test during the week ima look into this stuff
also next weekend ima attempt my roket burn‚•πcool‚•πthen i gotta go on the deb8 grind‚•πlol
anyone: anything
Michael: i have deb8‚•πcuz nat is like on the 28th and i hav prepped like 3 bills out of the 40 or so‚•πhave fun‚•πbut after nats and into june i hope life is fun again‚•πi see‚•πcuz like may has been a tough month‚•πsee the thing with machine learning
is that a good understanding of it requires a good understanding of calculus and image processing techniques
(for image processing applications)
so‚•πha, idk shit about calc‚•πwhat im more interested in
is the applications
and how to actually manipulate, transport, and apply models
so for example
there is an ARM CMSIS version of TensorFlow Lite
that allows you to run tensorflow on Cortex-M devices‚•πooo so then u could use a machine learning alg on like a nucleo‚•πyeah
but whats significant‚•πand like stick it in a drone or something‚•πis that i can run it in a low power environment
so i can create a battery-powered sensor
that has onboard AI
you would probably be able to get a pi or something on a drone‚•πooooo and then like collect mass amounts of data and send it over lora‚•πwell so
lora only lets you send like
5 bytes
but so
what you do‚•πyea
but like‚•πis you take 5KB of sound data‚•πthat should b enough‚•πyou process it
with the ML
and you decide
what is this sound?
then
you send a 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5
depending on what the sound is
so you take 5KB and turn it into 1B of actually relevant data
then you can send that one byte over lora‚•πok
or
u could like offload the entire application on a high frequency dmr signal
and then do the prossessing from a computer
and hav unlimited power‚•πwhat is DMR‚•πdigital microwave raido‚•πoh
the thing is
cost effective and power efficient solution
the problem is like
most tx/rx are very expensive, for both cost and power
whereas something like LoRa
is very cheap‚•πtrue‚•πand
very power efficient
my goal
is like
to be able to run one sensor‚•πyea, but u would b limited on the amount of data u can gather‚•πfor 1 year
on one battery‚•πthat seems intresting‚•πnot neccesarily
see
it depends what you care about
then
i can just do the processing onboard the sensor
and only transfer that one byte
to get past the LoRa issue‚•πyuh, but wouldent that prossessor use much power to do that‚•πthat's the question
but i would presume
like
if you are using a microcontroller
the power consumption is very low‚•πthat seems interesting to prsue‚•πregardless
in fact
lemme check‚•πi gotta do chem
ab
lab‚•π81 mA at max load for an stm32f446re
at 3.3v i believe
450 uA/MHz
there are more power-efficient options tho
like the efm32
which does 225 uA/MHz
and if it turns out i dont need as much cpu as those have
then i can use a lower power one
cy accidentally woke up 20 minutes early‚•πWhy u wake up so late‚•πSounds good! Just dm me how many and I'll get them ready by 6/15
Does that mean you biked to school? üòÉ‚•πLol yes‚•πMichael did not get any dogeeeeee
this is a sad day‚•πNooooooooo
Mine it then‚•πhonestly, ima j buy a bunch,‚•πOr that
The easy way‚•πi opened a robinhood account with the sole purpose of buying doge‚•πSmart‚•πand ima inject a bunch of money into it
for doge‚•πIf i were u i would invest in one of those hardware wallets‚•πnah‚•πDo it‚•πi dont trust them‚•πDoesnt robinhood give like 5$ free or something‚•πyea‚•πI mean its a hardware one so they r pretty secure‚•πstill, i would rather hav one on robinhood
bc that has a large backing behind it‚•πTrue
I would get a couple coins tho
Diversification‚•πyea they are dirt cheep‚•πWhats it at now?‚•πlike 50 cents
also igtg‚•πDamn‚•πbye‚•πYea cya‚•πwait, so its not private to everyone else?

That's it
NVIDIA hates this 71 line file

so it won't turbo
it caps out at 1.58 GHz

if you run throttlestop
it takes control of the cpu from the bios

it burned me‚•πi furgot‚•πsilverbenchmark‚•πok let me try
in chromium‚•πon what‚•πon a VM
on a raspbery pi 4‚•πok
im guessing around 2000
maybe 2500‚•πim guessing
2‚•π?
oh now im guessing more like 700
cuz when i tested the pi
i was on 4 native cores‚•πshould i install ublock‚•πand i got 3300
idk‚•πidk if that would speed it up
on my desktop
with a vm running
and a buncha apps‚•πi get like 30k
oh god‚•π7
i bet
that will be the score
imma increase the number of cpus to 4‚•πok‚•πwhat
is wrong with you debian
oh right i also need to get a cooler for this maybe that's why it's so bad‚•πmy 3300 was without a cooler
actually there might have been a fan

ap gov = the biggest joke
- you really thought AP classes were hard? think again
- introducing ap GOV
- legit all the quizzes are open note
- i said QUIZZES for a reason, there arent any tests
- you can legit just look everything up in the textbook and be 100% fine
- there are a few projects at the beginning of the year but the teacher gave up by the end so lmao just free quizzes
- the course is so short that they have to legit add a filler econ unit in the middle 
- did i say there werent any tests?
- and the ap test is also a joke, i legit ate a full lunch between the two sections‚•πlol
i literally dont remember anything‚•πhonors precalc
- the hardest class at ridge
if you survive then you passed the test
bruh‚•πCuz the cables in the monitors are dp
But they have HDMI ports on them‚•πI thought h chem or h alg2 wasss
im fucked next yearrr
bruhh‚•πLol no‚•πdont ask why, but i have an hdmi cable in my bag
do u need it‚•πWhy do you have it??????
XD‚•πidk, i think i was grabbing my charging cord for my computer on my desk in the morning when u are in like that zombie mode and dont rly know what is happening, and i grabbed an hdmi cord‚•πThx
Now we can yeet esxi next period‚•πsick‚•πyooo intellij nice‚•πooooo
bit late tho‚•πjoin 4h‚•πin deb8‚•πoh
have fun‚•πit will end at 740‚•πjoin if u want‚•πI can come after tho‚•πok‚•πcuz we doin a showcase‚•πok‚•πYes‚•πwho is the user on the right?
also is that facebook
is it still 2010?‚•πyes‚•πhm‚•πalso i think it's an ad
attempting to stream h264 screen capture over the network with hardware acceleration
the latency is not that bad but on my linux laptop it is even better
like it feels really smooth
this is over UDP
I might just make parsec for linux‚•πdang thats nice
i think its slightly off‚•πyeah obviously
i copied random stuff from a github gist
and another github issue‚•πyea but its good‚•πthe next step is to move this stuff to C‚•πthats how u made it so smooth?
i wanna know what th u did‚•πyea but i understand what they r doing
see im trying to make parsec for linux
like linux hosts‚•πdo it‚•πi feel bad just copying this guy's stuff but like it works
uh
it uses a screen capture thing called kmsgrab to read the framebuffer and then it encodes that into an mp4 stream using VAAPI hardware acceleration and then netcats it, which effectively creates a UDP stream
then you take that UDP stream and decode on the other side using mpv with some finetuning parameters‚•πHuh
So its not using parsec or anything like that
Intresting‚•πno it is a reimplementation of parsec basically
parsec is just this but instead of kmsgrab it uses a windows thing called DXGI‚•πHuh‚•π"wait cy, do you not‚Ä¶ remember how to do multiplication‚Ä¶?" (in the most serious tone possible)
- Calum
"option dollar times ten"‚•πwhen windows explorer uses 3GB of ram‚•πcy
i patched a binary for the first time in my life
and it worked‚•πcool‚•πi like edited the assembly instructions
it was a kernel module on esxi‚•π*contentful*
also cy
i will use like colors to show what is science and tech ect is what tent‚•πOk‚•πalso I talked to my parents and grandparents and other ppl who go to the 4h fair and they said that they would prefer to have a simple map with like the general area of where things would be‚•πSo like in the old app?‚•πand on the names of the areas I would make be like "dogs:
"dogs"
I showed them a ss i took of the old map and they said it was too complex‚•πHuh
Ok
Please present this at the next meeting‚•πok
so i came up with ieda‚•πAlso you should be discussing this in our discord
So all members can see‚•πo
i will send ss then‚•πOk‚•πshould I reflash to omega for AP tests‚•πDo it‚•πbut i have tetris installed owo nowo
tbf i dont think they will care but like ill do it anyway‚•πOh no
Thats
Not good is it‚•πit's saturday
i copied the screenshot off of the collegeboard website‚•πAh
I thought that was on ur thing‚•πi hope it wont be
this article
legit all the comments
are like "bro this looks off hes definitely a white supremacist"
it is so dumb‚•πYea
Its very
I dont think they realize‚•πI used this as evidence in an english essay‚•πThats a natural progression for ur fingers‚•πthe problem is it makes me doubt whether or not the article is credible
but like
this is the new york times
the commenters are idiots
but like there is so much of the stuff right that it starts getting to you
it's interesting
epsilon has new graphing features
so the graphing window is no longer god-awful‚•πwait send picture
i wanna see it‚•πthe auto and equal axes
wait the new omega has it too now
so if you upgrade omega you will get it‚•πthat looks so nice
i should‚•πwhat if we built another emu for numworks
like an SNES one
is that possible‚•πYou could write some arm assembly for your numworks‚•πright but that would be no fun
i mean maybe
if we write a custom OS for the numworks‚•πum does it?‚•πit does‚•πi just built from source and mine doesnt have it‚•πomega 15.5
did you pull‚•πWhat‚•π1.22.1‚•πThe auto axes
?‚•πyes‚•πi dont need to pull‚•πI have that‚•πi just checkout‚•πAnd I built from source
Stable source‚•πidk
ill re clone it‚•πDid you pull
Try pulling
I had to pull‚•πaww im sad
my custom theme no longer works‚•πI am scuffed I fone‚•πThat is very scuffed‚•πi thought mikel had a not an iphone
oh yea
ios launcher lol‚•πMachine learning for fiber optic shape sensing based on speckle pattern
Machine learning is interesting
And it actually worked‚•πoooooooo‚•πi am true speed‚•πidk
i have it all done‚•πFor all 20 ads?‚•πyup
60 sentences
the thing is
she doesn't actually have an assignment on classroom to submit it
so
if you dont have time its probably fine to do it tmrw‚•πThis is getting heated
And looking good
Cuz like sideloaded apps are sketch, but apples iap are like supermonopaly‚•πYea
I like the idea of the sideloading propositon tho
what they should do is kinda the same as what osx does
have two security options, one where app downloads can only be done throught the app store and the other being from the internet and verified developers‚•πye and it block downloads unless u dont disable thing
for those....ppl
I would also like to see where other app marketplaces can be downloaded from the app store so u dont have to go to the internet‚•πyes‚•πi guess i have to learn sql‚•πwhat have the AP tests done to me
1 + 1 = 3‚•πfor extremely large values of one‚•πno
yes
as 1 approaches 1.5
1 + 1 =3‚•πcy is facing a dilemma‚•πthe limit as 1 + 1 approaches 1.5‚•πregarding databases
and apis‚•πwhat is the cylemma‚•πsmh
the dilemma
is
what to use
supabase? dgraph? mongodb+python? wait does dgraph need an api for authentication? firebase?
supabase is nice but their free plan
hold on
"pauses"
your database
and your whole api
if no one uses it for 7 days
its another 500mb for free deal‚•πwhy dont u just
selfhost it‚•πwell the idea is
its completely free‚•πwhat do you think of this image
not now
after
so is selfhost‚•πno so
what i want is this:
rapid development
fully free hosting
all in the cloud
to permit for rapid website launches‚•πcy.‚•πthen ill pay if i actually need more
what.
w
wh
?‚•πlol
i made a bad joke‚•πyes
you did‚•πlol haha very funny lol‚•πlol‚•πum
AWS student free tier‚•πno‚•πand host any DB on it‚•πno deals
free for commercial use‚•πoh god
abuse netlify to run a database‚•πi think
the answer is supabase
i think
i need to be able to access and mutate data from a web client
can this do that
the thing with supabase
is their first tier paid plan
is $25
but‚•πimplement SoG‚•πi suppose‚•πSQL over Git‚•πif i wanted to
i could just self host‚•πyes.
also you could just use free tier‚•πwhen i need more‚•πIIRC
wait‚•π?‚•πfree tier expires or doesnt
i dont remember‚•πno
no the thing is like‚•πdoesn't expire or does expire‚•πwhat if i need 1GB
and for my app not to "pause"
does not‚•πthen‚•πthen i self host‚•πselfhost the data part
not the db‚•π?‚•πlike
wireguard over to ec2 and mount nfs‚•πi am not
using
wireguard
.‚•π.‚•πfor anything‚•π...
........
.
.
.
.
fine
i got u
hear me out cy
just hear me out
before you say a word
ec2 free tier running database.‚•πa word‚•πthen.
rclone mounted google drive folder
for db storage.‚•π-blinks-‚•πok im done now‚•πno
the answer
is
supabase
selfhosted
on vultr
if i need more than their free tier‚•πcringe
ok‚•πi just migrate my data over to the selfhosted one
why
*cough wireguard *cough ramesh‚•πcringe
just‚•πjust what‚•πjust selfhost
lol‚•πonsite host?‚•πyes‚•πwhat if i care about reliability‚•πin the Data Cynter‚•πand "set it and forget it"‚•πyes you run a data cynter‚•πwhat if my house loses power
what if i have to perform maintenance‚•πunivesral power cyply‚•πPaaS and SaaS has no maintenance downtime‚•πbackup cyerver‚•πupc
dont worry
its not set in stone
what is mrs harding showing us‚•πis this acutally somtething they showed
it has
expletives‚•πex-pleet-ivs‚•πfake news
regardless of gender, if u wear something that shows more, this is gonna happen‚•πsexual dimorphism exists in humans for evolutionary reasons, as it does for many other animals. however, as a civilized species, we must create a dynamic that can handle said dimorphism, in a way that is in everyone's best interest. males and females must both contribute to said dynamic.‚•πYou see
I think that this picture is misleading about sexual dimorphism
C WHY CANT I JUST SET THE RSP REGISTER
I HATE YOU
INSTEAD OF CASTING TO VOID* CANT I JUST SET RSP
can you elaborate on sexual dimorphism in humans
what are the characteristics
etc‚•πyou know
the characteristics
i need not elaborate‚•πi actually don't‚•πyea, but this is evident in males and females equally. So in both cases sexual dimorphism would be present if the male or the female exhibited behavior that is sexually provoking‚•πI feel as if males do not sexually provoke females as much with their clothing
For example, as in that statement, men do not tend to show much of their "legs, shoulders, or chests"‚•πbruhh, at the beach men dont wear shirts
also l8 night yt b like‚•πthis is at school tho
HAHA RELATABLE
im actually
trying to hack an nvidia enterprise software rn
and it is
not working‚•πha u resorted to binary operators‚•πi will resort
to literally
patching assembly code
if this doesnt work
im mad
cuz it was working‚•πrip Ramesh
also back to this, women should not b wearing those kinds of things at school cuz it is j not appropriate
like men dont go to school with no shirt on‚•πgirls go to school with no pants on‚•πyea...put on some pants‚•πi mean
i dont actually understand
wont it be cold‚•πyuh
they are going out of their way to do it‚•πfor what reason tho‚•πto b provoking probably
I dont understand women‚•πok
but then
dont make that statement
you know
the picture‚•πye‚•πand you complain when someone calls you out for being provoking
then
thats just‚•πyea, I was originally calling bs on the picture
i was j adding to this meening that it applies to men and women equally‚•πI think so
but girls kinda seem to exhibit no sexuality
so idk‚•πsame‚•πWhat the f is this conversation?!?‚•πmy stating my observations‚•πSQL IS DRIVING ME INSANE
HOW DO YOU DO THIS
supabase is driving me nuts
i just wanna prevent a user from creating more than 2 db records
and i cannot, for the life of me, figure out how to.
Its as if ABSOLUTELY NO ONE needs to prevent their users from spamming and filling up their database
asdfasdfalksdjf;alkdsjf;alksdjf;alksdjf‚•πhow u solve these‚•π1/whatever kc is
its flipped
so kc is the reciprocal‚•πye, but u would hav to calculate that and u dont got the numbers
wait‚•πmake an ice chart that goes to the right
ur given kc‚•πye, I j realized
im dum‚•πand instead of using 0.250 use 3‚•πmuch thx akhil‚•πthis one is 32
cause subsitute 1
and think it through by doubling and stuff‚•πbut like 1^2 = 1‚•πfrom my understanding since this is the common ion effect or something but choose the smaller values and stuff
yea
1 = (1)(1)^2(1)^3 is a true statement
so if u double one‚•πoooooo
i see‚•π? = (1)(2)^2(2)^3
32‚•πyeaaa, i was thinking of doubling the exponents
not the act reactant‚•πyea‚•πhow would u do 2 then‚•π?
ah that one‚•πlike this 2‚•πsince its solubilty from what people have told me
its to choose values that are smaller‚•πooooooo
much thx akhil‚•πnp‚•πsmh‚•πha‚•πoh believe me i'll never forget‚•πim trying to find a domain, but there are none
and even if I go to the ones u gotta pay for they are not available‚•πwhat domain name u lookin for?‚•πalphonse
idc about .me or whatever
I could have like alphonse5
or something like that‚•πFINISHED ALL THE AP TESTS
YES‚•πabout to start my last one
*this year‚•πSeminar?‚•πyes‚•πwhats it on‚•πargument analysis
and then this really subtle essay thing
where you have to write a perspective on an issue
they give you a bunch of sources
and your first instinct is to write a paper on the issue
but that is wrong
do not do that
you must write a paper on a different topic
the analogy was
say you are at a table with family at thanksgiving
and they are talking about an issue
you have to introduce yourself into the conversation
and you do not do that by restating everything they said
you do that by introducing your own thinking
and bringing in information from what they said
ima go now bye‚•πlol that is me every thanksgiving‚•πlol
what
tell me more
oh
i cant read
lol‚•πha‚•πi should learn to read
but like‚•πsame‚•πi just took an ap english test‚•πreading bork‚•πso like imma forget how to be literate now
i have to purge ap ptsd‚•πhahhahah, I forgot how to java after cs exam
i was like, bruhh what is class‚•πhaha relatable
actual icaths ptsle;
i cant
spel‚•πwell program in general‚•πso
soh
ai shud taek brake
bai‚•πbye‚•πhav fahn with roket‚•πlol
i dont hav to take an ap test to forget words‚•πGOOD LUCK CY!!!!!
YOU GOT THIS!!!!‚•πThanks!
I'm all done with it now
I think I will do ok
It was not that bad‚•πRip power
Rip kids taking an ap test rn‚•πLol yes‚•πDo u know
Which one it is
Rn
Lol csp
Only 2hrs tho‚•πI'm actually really lucky
I was taking it on a desktop
This was the one thing I was fearing about that choice‚•πU guys lost power?‚•πLuckily‚•πFor a few seconds‚•πInteresting
I need to now finish aphug hw
And Study for aphug‚•πi feel bad for you‚•πyea well its aphg
most colleges dont even accept the class
so im taking it a bit easy‚•πlmao
i wanna take seminar next year
over lit‚•πso my ap score doesnt really matter for it‚•πi have to email my guidance counselor‚•πdo it‚•πi wont be able to handle the stress of lit next year
i know my limits
so it's either honors lit
or
ap lit with no exam
or ap seminar‚•πu could‚•πthat was the option‚•πnot take the exam and just do the course‚•πthen i remembered someone told me she isnt going to take lit and take seminar
so i realized that was a thing again
so i want to do that‚•πig
its not a bad option either way‚•πi shelved it and then remembered today
so im considering
im also gonna take ap physics C not 2
just not take physics 2‚•πoh ur jumping from 1 to 3?
why not 2
is it bad‚•πi dont have to take 2
i HATE chem and the stuff in 2 is like chem stuff
like‚•πah‚•πthermodynamics
fluids
gases
so
like i actually liked kinematics and whatever
it was challenging but like also fun
like i probably got a 100 on the cumulative test‚•πdo it
im dying rn‚•πshould I just drop my final average in calc is an A+ to flex or no
it is kinda relevant‚•π‚Ä¶
sure‚•πbut i just want to flex more‚•πIt's probably less than an AP science or APUSH‚•πapush was free‚•πAlso if you're good at managing your time
But it's new stuff for most people‚•πI am awful
at managing time‚•πI mean
Frankly
I think it's not a bad class
But you would be taking it senior year‚•πyeah‚•πResearch is the one to do‚•πuh‚•πBut you won't be able to do that‚•πyou have to take seminar first
frankly im just consider this since someone told me I could
instead of english‚•πIdk seminar is fun if you make it fun
I can talk about this later‚•πi want to research something vaguely specifc‚•πI'm on my phone‚•πokay fine
ok‚•πI was at my sisters confermation when the power went out so the preist was like, jeasus is showing you that he is present
while all the old ladys for some reason screamed‚•πI'm here‚•π...
Wait what is a confermation
I hear it mentioned‚•πchristan thing where u become an adult in the christan church‚•πAh
So like whatever that thing is for jewish people‚•πyea‚•πMakes sense‚•πlol
for me the power cut the second I pressed the power button on my esxi vm‚•πthey are stupid
u start cramming the day before the day before ur test
but yes i am also kinda in the same boat
but im aphg
its not as bad as ap bio‚•πI am thinking of taking ap bio next year instead of ap enviro
i am no hippie, but it is an easy a for 7 credits
but i might wanna do stuff with bioengineering in collage‚•πI wanted to
But then i settled on either econ or math/stats‚•πyea, I think ima stick with roket
lol, then I gotta take some ap chem‚•πAnd fysicks‚•πyea, I was gonna take that anyways‚•πU could double up next year‚•πlike ap fysiks 1 and ap fysiks c
i already am with enviro‚•πDo both fysiks and chem
Ah‚•πbut like, ap chem
*ptsd with gas law test*‚•πYea‚•πi mean is ap chem better
like hav u heard anything‚•πNope‚•πbruhh‚•πIdk anyone that takes it
I mean i used to know someone who did it
But they long gone‚•πrip, what u doin next year
for szience‚•πAp fysiks
Thats a given‚•πwhat about with the other ap class u can take then‚•πAp econ‚•πcuz like elective period
ooooo
i was thinking about that
and was like, i can j take the ap test without the class‚•πYea its not a bad one to take
U could
I was thinking bout doing that with cs‚•πyea, cs is chill
wait
how can u take another ap
r u droping language‚•πNope‚•πcuz fsks u gotta take a study hall‚•πYea i then get one elective slot
Cause i finished all my credits
So i dont need actual electives like arts and stuff‚•πyea, so that goes to macro right‚•πBelieve so
I think it does both‚•πso u cant take another ap
wait i am a retard‚•πYea
But just to ease ur mind
I aint taking ap calc
Cp remember‚•πrip, can u take ap stats‚•πI can senior year‚•πlol what u gonna do for math‚•πI think ill prob double up stats and calc ab
Next year i take just calculus
Which is super stupid‚•πooo, i dident know there was a cp class for that
yea, j take the ap test‚•πWell it has all the dumb seniors and stuff‚•πyuk‚•πI could honestly
Self study and take the calc ap
But idk‚•πyea, but time = 0‚•πExactly
I also gotta study for the stupid entrance exams‚•πwdym
like coolage‚•πSi‚•πare those for like the ones in gb and stuff‚•πYup‚•πooooo, i hav a friend on my debate team that goes to cambrage and it is like rly good school‚•πYea i wanna go
That, oxford or kings college‚•πuk schools good school for math‚•πBut to do so i need to pass the entrance exam for mathematics
Which is absolutely cancer
7 questions
15 parts‚•πbruh
i mean at least they dont care about sat‚•πNo they do‚•πbruhhhhhh‚•πTo even think about applying from the us
To even put an admission
U need a 1480+ and 3 5‚Äôs on ap exams‚•πwholy shiiii
i am scared to take the sat cuz like i got a 1330 on the psat and am like, ima fail the sat and go to dum school‚•πWell u could take it again‚•πyea
i dident know u lost points when u got something wrong and you did not gain anything by skipping them
i prob could have done better‚•πYea
Honestly
U could bubble c
And get a 1100 or something‚•πha
like i did rly well on the meth section, but for some reason i cant read
*math‚•πNah its kinda the opposite
Reading i can breeze through
Writing is where i struggle
That is hard‚•πyea, that too‚•πIdk im worried bout aphg
Ugh‚•πLol look at my new pi‚•πah yes
what model is that
I wanna get it‚•πso apparently BTSD guest works
but not wastem‚•πthey probably changed the password‚•πwhere's the place you get those files
for numworks
for game thing‚•πu mean where do i get the roms?‚•πyes‚•πoff the internet‚•πwhere‚•πjust download em from a non-sketchy website‚•πsuch as‚•πgoogle nes or gameboy roms‚•πhow do I install them‚•πthen click the first website
and download it‚•πdo I use the numworks external app thing‚•πyea‚•πok
lemme try hold on‚•πu just add the .nes file to the thing as well as the emulator
itll come up and u can play‚•πok

supabase is driving me nuts again
when you sign in
it doesn't actually work
you have to reload the page

you dont tho
its like you cant get user details immediately after signing in‚•πthe ad

this is how you do "select * from users"‚•πsmh‚•πwhy
can you understand how it works‚•πsql is hard enough
its some binary thing‚•πyes
i fixed something‚•πcurrently im debugging my supabase posgresql problems
its like
crashing
in every way‚•πffmpeg is worse
i have to read a whole github guide
on how to use the C library‚•πhave fun
imma finish understanding supabase‚•πdatabase‚•πim making a fully functional app‚•πinstead of "select * from users"
why not
this‚•πlol
this part of my policy is broken‚•πyou cant
do that
in my database‚•πsomehow there is an infinite loop
idk how tho‚•πheck
i have to make the instructions 8 bytes each‚•πyou should program microcontrollers
make a database that works over I2C‚•πmaybe
I want to do this
though‚•πit would be cool if like
i could plug a microcontroller into a dimm slot
and have it read from the database
over smbus/i2c
im really tired rn
you shouldn't listen to me‚•πi wont
im going to bed in like 2 minutes‚•πim going to bed once this works
which could take a while‚•πthis has to be
the dumbest thing ive ever thought of makign
oh god
dealing with numbers is easy
I think
i havent actually checked if this works‚•πdealing with this stupid infinite recursion issue is not‚•πdw
ffmpeg is
worse
this should work
i think‚•πum
ok‚•πit like
gets the first

but the leftmost byte
is 3 away
since the cast to u8‚•πarent most things big endian‚•πreads from the rightmost byte
i think like
tcp/udp is big endian
and x86 and arm and whatever are little‚•πlike if i say 100 is 8
that is big endian right‚•πyes
but
it's also
8 in little endian‚•πno 001 would be little endian‚•πno
each byte is preserved as left to right‚•πah
i see
ok‚•πyeah‚•πso you thought it was cba
but it was abc‚•πwell
the example was
0x20801801
which is 4 bytes
so I thought it was taking the 20 as the first thing when casting to a byte
but it takes the 01‚•πit takes the least significant right‚•πwait but then
wait
01 18 80 20
is how it is represented in memory
so i was right
in the wrong way
idfk tbh
this is weird‚•πim too tired to think about this atm‚•πyeah same
it works
so ill leave it alone‚•πi might leave supabase alone as well‚•πsleep or something‚•πlol‚•πimagine‚•πcant relate‚•πlol
uh
how do you make the right shift like
"overflow"
and not
rotate‚•πum
why do you need that‚•πidk
it
20 80 18 01

shift right 1: 20
shift right 2: 80
shift right 3: 20‚•π?‚•πidk cy
ill figure it out‚•πit would be 01 18 80
frankly if i just sleep
and come back tomorrow‚•πshift 0 is last byte
shift 1 is first byte
shift 2 is second byte
shift 3 is FIRST BYTE‚•πmy problem will probably just solve itself‚•πwhat in tarnation
like how does this even make sense‚•πramesh üíõ binary‚•πnot that
the other thing‚•πwhat other thing‚•π*cygh‚•πmy brain is shutting down‚•πthere are 13 people in this group chat‚•πi can barely type anymore‚•πso I have amnesia‚•πstop. go to sleep. this can wait.‚•πi need to figure it out tho
im so close‚•πima go

You can't parse [X]HTML with regex. Because HTML can't be parsed by regex. Regex is not a tool that can be used to correctly parse HTML. As I have answered in HTML-and-regex questions here so many times before, the use of regex will not allow you to consume HTML. Regular expressions are a tool that is insufficiently sophisticated to understand the constructs employed by HTML. HTML is not a regular language and hence cannot be parsed by regular expressions. Regex queries are not equipped to break down HTML into its meaningful parts. so many times but it is not getting to me. Even enhanced irregular regular expressions as used by Perl are not up to the task of parsing HTML. You will never make me crack. HTML is a language of sufficient complexity that it cannot be parsed by regular expressions. Even Jon Skeet cannot parse HTML using regular expressions. Every time you attempt to parse HTML with regular expressions, the unholy child weeps the blood of virgins, and Russian hackers pwn your webapp. Parsing HTML with regex summons tainted souls into the realm of the living. HTML and regex go together like love, marriage, and ritual infanticide. The <center> cannot hold it is too late. The force of regex and HTML together in the same conceptual space will destroy your mind like so much watery putty. If you parse HTML with regex you are giving in to Them and their blasphemous ways which doom us all to inhuman toil for the One whose Name cannot be expressed in the Basic Multilingual Plane, he comes. HTML-plus-regexp will liquify the n‚Äãerves of the sentient whilst you observe, your psyche withering in the onslaught of horror. Rege ÃîÃâx-based HTML parsers are the cancer that is killing StackOverflow it is too late it is too late we cannot be saved the transgression of a chiÕ°ld ensures regex will consume all living tissue (except for HTML which it cannot, as previously prophesied) dear lord help us how can anyone survive this scourge using regex to parse HTML has doomed humanity to an eternity of dread torture and security holes using regex as a tool to process HTML establishes a breach between this world and the dread realm of cÕíÕ™oÕõÕ´rrupt entities (like SGML entities, but more corrupt) a mere glimpse of the world of reg‚Äãex parsers for HTML will ins‚Äãtantly transport a programmer's consciousness into a world of ceaseless screaming, he comes, the pestilent slithy regex-infection wil‚Äãl devour your HT‚ÄãML parser, application and existence for all time like Visual Basic only worse he comes he comes do not fi‚Äãght he comÃ°eÃ∂s, ÃïhÃµi‚Äãs unÃ®hoÕûly radianÕÅceÕÅ destro“âying all enliÃçÕÑÃÇÕÑghtenment, HTML tags leaÕ†kiÃßnÕòg frÃ∂oÃ®m Ã°yo‚ÄãÕüur eyeÕ¢sÃ∏ ÃõlÃïikÕèe liq‚Äãuid pain, the song of reÃ∏gular exp‚Äãression parsing will exti‚Äãnguish the voices of mor‚Äãtal man from the sp‚Äãhere I can see it can you see Ã≤ÕöÃñÕîÃôiÃÇÕÅÃ©tÃÅÃãÕÄÃ≤ÕéÃ©Ã±Õî it is beautiful t‚Äãhe final snuffing of the lie‚Äãs of Man ALL IS LOSÃÅÃèÕÑÕñÃ©ÕáÃóÃ™T ALL I‚ÄãS LOST the ponÃ∑y he comes he cÃ∂ÃÆomes he comes the ich‚Äãor permeates all MY FACE MY FACE ·µíh god no NO NOOÃºO‚ÄãO NŒò stop the an‚Äã*ÕëÃæÃæÃ∂‚ÄãÃÖÕ´ÕèÃôÃ§gÕõÕÜÃæÕ´ÃëÕÜÕáÃ´lÃçÕ´Õ•Õ®ÕñÕâÃóÃ© ÃüeÃÖÃ†s ÕéaÃßÕàÕñrÃΩÃæÕÑÕíÕëe n‚Äãot reÃÄÃëÕßÃåaÕ®lÃÉÕ§ÕÇÃæÃÜÃòÃùÃô ZAÕ†Ã°ÕäÕùLGŒå ISÕÆÃÇ“âÃØÕàÕïÃπÃòÃ± TOÕÖÕáÃπÃ∫∆ùÃ¥»≥  THÃòEÕÑÃâÕñ Õ†PÃØÕçÃ≠OÃö‚ÄãNÃêYÃ° HÕ®ÕäÃΩÃÖÃæÃéÃ°Ã∏Ã™ÃØEÃæÕõÕ™ÕÑÃÄÃÅÃßÕòÃ¨Ã© ÕßÃæÕ¨ÃßÃ∂Ã®Ã±ÃπÃ≠ÃØCÕ≠ÃèÕ•ÕÆÕüÃ∑ÃôÃ≤ÃùÕñOÕÆÕèÃÆÃ™ÃùÕçMÕäÃíÃöÕ™Õ©Õ¨ÃöÕúÃ≤ÃñEÃëÕ©ÕåÕùÃ¥ÃüÃüÕôÃûSÕØ ÃîÃ®ÕÄÃ•ÕÖÃ´ÕéÃ≠‚•πReddit?

should I do it
imma flahs a custom rom‚•πok‚•πguys
if you ever
ever make a chat program
make sure to strip location EXIF data

with someone who sent me something on imessage
imessage does not do that‚•πah
was it a random person
or like someone you know
really
REALLY
hmm.
thats INTERESTING‚•πa somewhat random person
that i met at a ski resort‚•πlol hmm
i need to try something now
do iphone screenshots have EXIF
let's find out
EXIF geolocation
no iphone images do not have geolocation
lol rust
shut up‚•πlol‚•πthis is a built in data type

this is painful‚•πoh right
you have all the totp stuff‚•πyeah‚•πset up on the phone

I should install ESXi on my mac mini
so I can make more macs
or maybe I should just try and make esxi_unlock work
and then
run imessage on my "mac"
lol hac
someone is going to hackintosh the rpi soon
how do you even fix that‚•πi doubt it‚•πyou have to use the smc configurator‚•πthat would be pretty hard
telegram is being laggy on mac
the next 4h meeting may be dedicated to dealing with safari‚•πlol
mac version or qt version‚•πidk lemme send a screenshot
oh thats nice
it like‚•πthats the mak version
yeah it does that‚•πputs the screenshot on a white background‚•πnot really
KDE does it though
I'm pretty sure
deleted for privacy reasons‚•πsee rounded corners are nice
but they are so annoying
from a development standpoint‚•π"there are 13 people here"
I used to have them on bspwm
like
it was the WM doing the rounding
so it could probably truncate some of the content possibly‚•πwindows might get rounded corners
but im not sure if i want rounded corners
no i think i do want rounded corners‚•πi want rounded cyners as well‚•πlol‚•πI should make a program called cyify
Cynvert a sentence to a cytence‚•πplease do
write it in python
then i can add it to my bot‚•πcyfinfaza: yna gallaf ei ychwanegu at fy bot‚•πlol

i dont like working
how do I make them all the same height when I highlight‚•πUm
Send me the html
I can't do anything rn
But once I'm back at my computer‚•πok

it seems to now be mostly fixed‚•πlol
ok how to
i was doing stuff‚•π?‚•πthis‚•πidk it doesn't look that broken for me
it looks mostly fine
I thought you had already fixed it‚•πI didn't
give a second
right‚•πim learning about mapbox‚•πthis is clearly a firefox problem
lol‚•πlol
im confused as to what you want from me
do you want me to do anything‚•πno
i will have to figure this out
i mean if you wanna test it in firefox
and fix it for me/figure out why it happens
you can
but like‚•πi would like to make cy2 screenshare work‚•πyeah‚•πthen maybe we can discuss‚•πthen
do not bother this‚•πok if you have any specific questions
ask me
although css is more like cs-mess
so like
idk‚•πNew idea for a css
Cys‚•πbad‚•πyou should
add the cyifier i made‚•πi could do that
but im working on cy2 screenshare rn
i need it to work at school
so i need to move it to port 443‚•πdude, I made it to the qf of the ncfls and idk how
all these ppl are jrs and seniors‚•πOh damn nice

or export the recovery codes‚Ä¶
i found it
that was problematic
i set a serif font on my phone
and it is actually not that bad‚•πthe quality
of this menu
1200% i say‚•πwho is this dominic person‚•πsomeone who used to be in our club
idk if they still are
also idk why my site is broakin‚•πcisco‚•πThose r so cool
Rack mounted anything becomes cool
Ah i miss my servers now‚•πthis
in 8th grade
since i actually have no idea
this is a worthless piece of trash
that sounds like a jet engine‚•πThat router?
How
Is that even possible
My servers are quieter than that‚•πit is a router
perfect
this is exactly what the router has
I should try and install MIPS linux on this
since I think this router is a MIPS CPU
Also if anyone here wants a pi case I can print one for you‚•πi could do that
when i have time
my ipod touch is disassembling itself
which is weird for an apple product
the battery wants out‚•πi should probably be more concerned about slicing my finger on the fan than the pi dying‚•πlol slicing your finger on a 12v fan running on 5v
you should see
what i did with a fan‚•πfirst let me get my pi 3‚•πlets just say
the way it ended
2 blades broke off the fan
upon impact
with my thumb‚•πwhat about your thumb‚•πit was
ugly
to say the least‚•πthat
i do not want to imagine plus
okay where did my pi go
cy‚•πyes‚•πok
do you know what the blue one is for
The blue wire is the PWM signal wire. Without it the fan should stay at full speed all the time. If you repair it you should regain the ability to control the fan speed, if you choose to.Jun 15, 2012‚•πthis was meant to be in response to the cy but it also applies to the proceeding message‚•πhmm
okay‚•πif you run it at 5v
it will be slow
and quiet‚•πok
let me try first
i need an actual power supply tho‚•πcy is using mapbox
mapbox is nice
its based on webgl
but its like
actually good‚•πwhere am i going to get the power supply
yeah I've heard about it
it used to be open source too‚•πwould you like me to test something for you
i can test the continuity on the pi4
between the usb port
and the power lines‚•πsure‚•πif i find full continuity
my sureness it will not fry moves to 95%
i just have to find my pi 4
its like
somewhere
over the rainbow‚•πi mean im using a 3b+ rn‚•πoh‚•πsince i care less about this one
i just want to see if we get fan spin‚•πidk just try it‚•πum‚•πfanspin‚•πi dont really have a micro usb power supply
chooch
louis rossmann‚•πima keep theming
and working with mapbox‚•πok
imma find a psu‚•πhave fun‚•πi might just use the oneplus
even tho it's not enough
lol fan spin
imma extract all the fans from the mips router
oh I might also have a 5v fan
I'm retrying the pi benchmarks with a fan
I overclocked it
it's like 600 points more‚•πThat‚Äôs pretty good‚•πP2966 second run
great way to benchmark I know
3rd run: P2967‚•πcy is learning go‚•πoh good luck with that
i hated it
cause it only compiles if u use all the variables
u cant leave unused ones‚•πidrc
see
the thing is
i wanna write an api
that works on vercel
and i dont wanna use nodejs
and i wanna know a compiled language
and python and vercel are having relationship issues
is the bane of my existence
vercel is like
no
no
you will not
no
;alskdfj;alskdfj;alskdfj
so im like
time to learn go
cuz both netlify and vercel support it so‚•πGo is bad
because
someone told me go is bad‚•πum mongodb drivers in go
are um
complicated
*yawn
i just need to get vercel to stop giving me stupid errors
because it still runs on python 3.6
like its the stone ages or something
hmm
so
codetools-api
which works
has a requirements.txt
with version numbers in it
what if
i just grab all those known working versions
and put them in the requirements.txt for this one
a lot of them are like
completely new
like
codetools-api uses Flask 1.1
whereas web-analytics which uses 2.0
hmm
its ok Vercel. ill follow you back to the stone ages
why is this not a thing‚•π/etc/fstab

normal people:

etc fs tab
filesystem tab
fs tab

me: 

etc f STAB

STAB THE F
TianoCore for ARM
ok conclusion
if you want to virtualize on a raspberry pi
dont use esxi
it's that simple
the performance is trash
like
my unoverclocked pi on kvm
performs better
than my MAX overclocked esxi pi
stonks
we went from this
to 1000 points more‚•πBruhh‚•πwait
thats really cheap tf
i want this one‚•πYeee

Also resin printers rly gud‚•πyea‚•πLike if ur gonna get a printer that rize

i bought my pi
and
it works‚•πbut u need some other things to properly handle it‚•πin school‚•πSick
Do u hav cable this time‚•πlike i got it to connect and everything so I can actually show it off
i dont need one
it uses ethernet‚•πOoooo‚•πi brought an ethernet cable to school
and i connect it to my laptop‚•πI mean properly
i j put the parts i print out in the su

Also me and akhil had that test last week lol‚•πlol‚•πI got the vaccine and everything and I am not an anti vaxer, but im listening to this and I am thinking‚•πis there a transcript‚•πsadly no
i am transcribing it now
with cool transcribe software‚•πconjugate acid is essentially a base

conjugate base is an acid
so remove a H+‚•πok
thank you‚•πnp‚•πi thought u needed to do stuff with the rxn‚•πnope‚•πand i was like bruhh‚•πthis one is super super super ez‚•πye
i was like, is tong pullin one on us
but he was nice for this
so wait for the ones without a h
like this
do u do nothing‚•πwell
thats for the conjugate acid right?
u add one
so it becomes HNO_2‚•πoooo
much thx‚•πnp‚•πhi
could someone
before this period ends
lol
actually I could test this next period as well‚•πwhat i put here to get my contentful data displayed
this time there are no errors‚•πwhat is appearing‚•πfirstpost, bodyofpost, time, images‚•πsend screenshot‚•πi did‚•πno of what appears
on the page‚•πok
j the first page thing‚•πso it says test1
is test1 the content of firstPost in contentful?‚•πye‚•πok so basically
what you wanna do is like‚•πalso i update thing
to this‚•πand so on
with all the things you need‚•πoooo
ok
thank u‚•πur welcome‚•πmuch thanks‚•πyeah but now replace the first P with an H1
and make the date be under it
rather than below the content
also
you should use ReactMarkdown
which allows you to write your posts in markdown
in contentful
and have them appear nice in your website
you can look at the 4H app for reference
on the first page
it pulls content from contentful (although in a different way than this) and then it puts it in ReactMarkdown to make it appear nice
with headings and images and all that‚•πok‚•πshould i install this
im debating on it
it allows u to sideload apps essentially
and itll sign apps and everything‚•πhuh
you should try it‚•πi want to
but
it uses a mac as a server
which idk about‚•πidk‚•πamc
is the next gme
according to reddit frontpage‚•π*blinks‚•πman
i should have invested in it
wish i coudl
do that‚•πu prob could‚•πna
im not allowed‚•πbut that stuff i usually stay away
its way to volatile to predict anything
honestly tho
if u just go on r/wallstreetbets
and do whatever they do‚•πit's for people with extra cash who dont know what to do with it‚•πu could prob make some money‚•πso it doesnt matter
yeah
i might try it in college if i have money‚•πhonestly netlify looked better in serif‚•πcorrection
Everything looks better in serif‚•πnah
most things look better in sans
but
netlify‚•πif u use a subtle serif things look nice‚•πthey had a really nice serif‚•πyea it was nice
sans imo is hard to get right‚•πimo its the other way around‚•πreally?
this was way better‚•πyeah
cy might make a blog
in gatsby‚•πi might as well
in jekyll
or gatsby‚•πi wanna host it on netlify‚•πidk i think jekyll is prob nicer‚•πcuz like
netlify probably is better for gatsby‚•πyea thats nice‚•πVercel is good for next
but‚•πim prob gonna do github pages
if that even works‚•πim not used to limits
vercel has no limits
well
they have 2 limits
no more than 1 team member
so no teams
and no more than 100 builds per day
other than that
oh and
no more than one project with server-side analytics enabled
but other than that
unlimited transfer
unlimited api calls‚•πooo
i finally got this dang thing to work
it was so simple
svg's‚•πyes‚•πare amazing
they can do everything u want‚•πand you can style them with css
and animate them with css‚•πi mean now i cant put text for some reason but thats probably a css issue
yea
which is perfect‚•π^^theme changing svgs‚•πapcs final?‚•πyes
with matt‚•πthats pretty cool‚•πim thinking of how i wanna set up my blog‚•πoh i already did
its a matter of
can i do it‚•πYou Can Do It‚•πcause its kinda a bit mabye a lot ambitious‚•πhow ambitious‚•πvery ambitious in my book
well‚•πwhat is ambitious about it‚•πactually thats prob cause idk much bout html/css/js
if i did its prob not that hard whatsoever‚•πwhat specifically do you think will be hard
cuz i can tell you
if it will be‚•πhonestly its prob going to be how im going to get jekyll front matter to show up on the website
that or animation‚•πwhat is jekyll
and frontmatter‚•πstatic thing like gatsby
meant for blogs‚•πbut you can do that with Gatsby too‚•πyea u can
its‚•πalso what is "frontmatter"‚•πits like a thing u add at the top of stuff
like author title time
but it can be other stuff
if i get annoyed using this ill probably use gatsby‚•πah ok
ok i get it
but not jekyll
its like
ruby Gatsby?‚•πi think
i looked it up on reddit‚•πdoes it use React‚•πthis was one of the things people recommended
dont think so
its html‚•πso you write it in vanilla‚•πwell
u can write it in markdown files as well i believe‚•πwell no i mean like‚•πbut ive been writing it in vanilla‚•πthe code‚•πyea like <body> whatever‚•πik the actual posts are md
tbh that's probably fine for a blog site
with not much interactive content‚•πyea
but idk
i shall see‚•πok
if i make a blog
imma make it with Gatsby‚•πyea‚•πim good at Gatsby now‚•πcause u used it alot‚•πyes‚•πi like reacts animation stuff
react spring is such a nice library‚•πlol yes
i have not used it
but i saw it
tbh i dont wanna make a blog blog
i wanna make like
a multimedia blog
cuz i dont have time to write‚•πyea im gonna host my github stuff there as well‚•πthe problem with a multimedia blog with videos and stuff is that like
storage
and
hosting‚•πserver‚•πbut afaik GitHub has no limits
and neither does vercel‚•πyea
i believe u can use github pages with jekyll
which is also kinda why i wanna use it‚•πyeah
well
can you use Gatsby?
i wanna see hold on
ok so you can
but you cant
you cant do the fancy build in the cloud thing
but you can just build locally and push the build to GitHub pages‚•πinteresting‚•πvercel builds in the cloud
so you dont manage anything‚•πcorrection cy
everything looks better in serif‚•πAGAINNNNN‚•πYea i think it‚Äôs gonna fall down tho
Isnt amc recalling its shares back to recount?‚•πthis funny‚•πLol does "The Babylon Bee" have a video about the capitol riot *cough actual domestic terrorism‚•πlol‚•πwhat has my French class come to

since it was more
useful
and fun‚•πRamesh meeing far better = A+ > A‚•πno

otherwise id have gotten a B+ in chem
or prob worse‚•πooooo
i am getting 2 contentful posts where i hav them being orderd by type, but not like that post they are
so how would i get like the post order that I want
this is kode now‚•πyes
no
wait‚•πRamesh is compiling
and has thrown an exception
you need to install a new dependency of ramesh
npm install Ramesh-doz-react
if Michael were to code a cow
it works‚•πthat
is freaky‚•πtrue‚•πalso I believe gravity is being ignored‚•πwe haven't done npm install gravity‚•πhaha‚•πidt we should do that tho‚•πnope
its like when teachers tell u to assume no friction‚•πfax‚•πjust have no gravity‚•πand no drag
ha, coefficents are 0‚•πg = 0
fs = 0‚•πeverything is now 0‚•πf_k = 0‚•πyes‚•πF = 0
I = 0
current is zero
your computer should shut down‚•πnoooo‚•πHa i have a latop

imma let the user choose
whether they like sans or serif

blue or white or black
your blog is completely dysfunctional on mobile
you should fix that
my goal for my blog design is for it to work in all browsers
from IE to firefox mobile‚•πIE is dropping support in a few years aint it?‚•πits a challenge
but yeah
something like that‚•πyea next year‚•πi still have it
on my pc
i like to destroy websites

gimme a website
i can destroy it for you
imma use a flexbox‚•πnice
idk how imma go about making mine
i has a design
a design‚•πim making something basic for now
kinda like rameshs
but it works on mobile‚•πive just been slowly making it in vanilla
and ill adapt it later‚•πyeah that's what im doing
im making it in vanilla first‚•πthat way its way easier to fix and learn what to do‚•πyes
GitHub lol
github turned into a giant egg
ok this actually looks pretty nice
font-wise‚•πThis is why
U use serif
What font is that?‚•πDM Serif Text‚•πLooks nice‚•πikr‚•πI still like libre Baskerville
But thats a close second‚•πnah
dm serif is better‚•πYea in that scenario dm looks better‚•πill leave it as an option
in my settings‚•πYea u can leave it
I am realizing
That i need to add a post number
To give each post a unique id‚•πwhy dont 1*10^-14 work‚•πhmm
uh
so
ur sig figs r wrong
remember‚•πyeah smh michal‚•πbefore decimal place doesnt matter
its after‚•πbruhbruhbruhbruhbruhbruhbruhbruhbruhbruhbruhbruhbruhbruhbruhbruhbruhbruh‚•πcause the 11 is decided by the exponent‚•πyea‚•πso u need 11.whatever the 2 digits here‚•πwh‚•πso then 11.08‚•π3 sigfigs?‚•πyea‚•πisnt that 4 tho
im confused akiru help‚•πbefore decimal place doesnt matter
no‚•πi know‚•πye, but tong man says before decimal place‚•π?‚•π11.1 is 3 sf
2.78 or wotever is also
3sf‚•πtry 11.08
if that doesnt work‚•πye, but he says bc of like doing the calculations with scientific notation u gotta hav the digits after the dp‚•πill pull up mine and try like 11.0whatever two go here and stuff
yea‚•πmuch thx akhil‚•πdid it work?‚•πi ran out of tries‚•πthis is bcuz akhil is a geniuz

But not this
I want like a disk off of one‚•πthis is a starting point
for my blog
style-wise
i do however have to figure out how i want the header to stick to the page
i can make it stick
but it looks really ugly rn cuz its so big
also i need some media queries
so it doesn't look weird on mobile
you have to agree
this looks pretty good
ie be like‚•πYea it looks good‚•πok‚•πoooooo
I like the menu transisions‚•πikr‚•πare you *content-ful* with your posts‚•πnot yet
there are no posts yet
its just like
generic content‚•πr u using contentful‚•πno im not even using Gatsby yet‚•πbruhh‚•πim just making a proof of concept
for my style‚•πok‚•πmy next step is to make a Gatsby site
and figure out the logistics of that
lol tasmota commit suicide
now i have to reconfigure everything
or my lights will not turn back on
why is this wrong
i did work‚•πidt u convert to mols when finding the conc
so you would hav 1.5/1,1
1.1
also for x when I calculated with ur numbers on the bottem I got 7.524e-5
wait nvm
for that calc‚•πyes, let's just print 6 trillion dollars twitter‚•πWhat
I wanna try this now
Concentration is molarity
And molarity is moles/liters
Its cause ur doing small number approximation
When ur kc value is nowhere even close to a proper value to approximate
The rule of thumb is 10^-4 and smaller‚•πit prob doesn't do anything‚•πno I think it can recognize key presses
and make blinky lights
and it might even be able to control the screen
you should try it
if you need an stlink i have one
but i don't think you need an stlink‚•πyea its just a normal flash
but i dont have the things to flash it rn
especially the most important part
the calculator‚•πlol
where is your calculator‚•πin a box
in a storage facility‚•πwhy‚•πbecause all my stuff is in a storage facility‚•πare you moving or something?‚•πyea‚•πwhere are you moving to
and why on earth would you put your calculator in storage‚•πim staying in the hills‚•πits like‚•πeverything in my room was put into storage‚•πyou should have grabbed your calculator so you could use it on chem and math
but ok
and to flash sketchy rust code onto it
I need ideas for slam poetry‚•πwrite a slam poem
about slamming people‚•π*blink‚•πi am not content with this error‚•πidk i am not graphql master

i have a micro b cable
imma try that numworks thing

wait i can use wsl
but
I'm not interested in attempting to install the entire arm embedded toolchain in 3 minutes on school wifi
so maybe this is a later thing
also usb dfu wont work in wsl
so i have to use linux‚•πBut alas no I think it's a bad at all from android he had his by been he‚•πi have to use an online calc and its not giving me the third dp‚•πI'm on da bus, sorry for late reply
And edulastic was like, I don't like phone‚•πAh np‚•πBye bye power‚•πbye‚•πWho else lost power‚•πnot me‚•πMe
But it bacc‚•πis it a sig fig issue or am i stupid

and as everyone knows
you dont need to be smart to be hot‚•πwait i thought it was gonna be like 50$ or so
its only 25$‚•πyep‚•πwait

...‚•πStoneOS
WAIT

lol css‚•πwdym
you mean‚•πyes‚•πhow could one think that...
to custom domains
see what i dont get is like
how do they make money‚•πsell ur data duh
idk‚•πinherently, my data is already public
...if they have it
yes
i was just
going to say‚•πI mean paid model
They probably have a paid model
And then commercial pricing
Oh god
Wood blocks
Interesting choice‚•πclick clickclick click‚•πInteresting‚•πLucas and Cy
i mildly remember lucas
they deleted my blackrocket project‚•πlol banana phone
no
bannanas
I added a file
im trying to think about how to make an immutable system
i was thinking 
partitions A B C D E
A & B are system partitions with software
C is the "springboard" partition
D is the bootloader partition
E is the data partition
C might be gotten rid of idk‚•πI mean do u need a springboard?
Im assuming the springboard manages A & B‚•πMy computer crashed‚•πNice‚•πDon't use Wayland kids
Yes
U would need a rly smart bootloader
so basically
D boots C
then C checks to launch A or B‚•πYea‚•πhmm
wait
no you dont need a C
you just need to modify the bootloader‚•πIf its only A & B yea i dont think u need C‚•π.
and basically if A/B boots successfully you
set a flag on the bootloader
to not boot into the other one
and then it stays like that
until the updater runs
then it tells the bootloader to choose the other one (but like provisional)‚•πThat works‚•πthen the bootloader checks if it's provisional and if the provisional flag doesn't get removed
it means that something screwed up
then when the system reboots it will delete the provisional flag and then boot into the original system
i think
thats kinda like how android works‚•πIs it?‚•πyep‚•πIk springboard is a apple thing‚•πyeah ik too
i just call it that here‚•πDidnt know android had something like it‚•πsince that term makes sense‚•πYea‚•πno it's unrelated
thats ur app springboard
this is an "OS springboard"‚•πBut its function‚•πthe names arent related in anyway just the name is the same‚•πYea i figure‚•πalso you could do an ostree setup as an alternative
or snapshot
so btrfs for example has snapshots
and you'd snapshot, update, then if the update fails, rollback the snapshot
ostree is like git for filesystems
so if it screws up, you just roll back
hmm
can I add one
^^‚•πlol‚•πthats my testimonial‚•πtestimonials are words
not pictures‚•πa picture is a thousand words
so that is 1000 words‚•πyou cannot cast a picture to words

u could
if ur determined‚•π*safely eat it‚•πthere u go‚•πimma ask my various teachers for testimonials

tf
it is an acid if it accepts a pair
it is a base because it needs a pair‚•πLewis things are backwards I think
Tbh not too sure, I want to ask Pernia today‚•πI believe lewis is the same as your conjugate whatever
A conjugate acid is the base once it recieved an electron and vice versa
A normal base accepts, acids give‚•πA lewis acid accepts an electron pair
A lewis base needs an electron pair
according to the webassign‚•πyea cause its the opposite
conjugate acid is a base pretty much‚•πno no no
are supposedly the same thing‚•πyea thats the same thing
wait what?‚•πread the WebAssign question‚•πah this is lewis
not lowry
yea ammonia would be a lewis base
because it has a lone pair of electrons
that can be donated to the acid‚•πsmrt
I thought it dissociated into 1
h3po4
i tried 3, but i get 8.00*10^-4
and it dont work‚•πit should be 3

cuz 450 ml is 2
and h2so4 is 2
fuck

french b like‚•πTo begin to look at the impacts of censorship by social media monopolies, we look towards the actions of the United States in combating their reign of censorship. When the bill of rights was ratified in 1789, the United States took a path of freedom for all of its citizens. Taking back the reins of government, people were thought to never have their liberties threatened. However, fast forward to the 21st century and the size of the federal government had grown, but was not as big as tech corporations that dominated the social and economic landscapes of the world. Due to their monopolistic status, large tech companies had the keys to the internet, and with it, the keys to global free speech. In 2008, as large tech monopolies were growing along with their potential for control of major socioeconomic landscapes, the US government sought not to lift a finger. This is contributed to the financial crisis that preceded the era as Congress wanted to pass legislation to aid the economy and contribute to the creation of jobs, instead of the regulation of corporations, which inhibited the creation of jobs (Cato Institute). Thus, after the initial recovery after the financial crisis of 2008, the US government started to crack down on the actions of big tech, and the scope in which their power was portrayed throughout the world. This was instated with several key investigative committees put in place in the mid 2010s and a revised mandate towards the FCC outlining steps to take to regulate online media outlets (CNBC). These steps taken by the federal government, were the first official regulatory bodies for media platform moderation. As time progressed, the scope of online social media outlets expanded, and so did their policies for moderation. Under Section 230, a piece of legislation that gave social media companies the power to remove elicit content form their sites, media platforms started to remove content that they deemed objectively hateful (Teh). In this move, tech companies started to censor content that was objectively out of the scope of Section 230, as elicit content was made subjective to the media platform. Thus, in 2017, a judicial committee under the branch of the Department of Justice, launched an investigation into the constitutionality of Section 230, and to eventually bring it to the bench of the Supreme Court (Zenial). However, due to the sweeping protections outlined under Section 230, Congress is powerless in passing the legislation that would nullify the law as that would mean an overreach of legislative powers. As the US government is in gridlock, and as the cracks in the Republic start to widen, large tech companies are making swift action to exercise their grip on the world, and push the agenda that best suits their woke ideals. American citizens, once free to express their opinion without social and economic ramification, are now subject to the same dystopian legislature pushed in facist regimes. The so-called ‚Äòfreedom of speech‚Äô guaranteed by the founding fathers that gave American‚Äôs the right to express themselves freely is not allowed to be exercised. The only thing that is allowed to be expressed on the platforms these large tech companies control is the one sided agenda, that has so far, been only from the Democratic Party (Pew Research Center). During the Pandemic, these problems have only been exacerbated, and the Triopoly of Facebook, Twitter and Google, prevented the free expression of American‚Äôs in their darkest hour. These outlets were the only accessible public communication medium for everyday citizens and only tightened their grip on the everyday lives of American Citizens. In all, the very government of the United States, that was created to protect the rights of the people it serves, has failed in protecting American‚Äôs Right to free speech through its lackluster control of monopolistic tech corporations.

I question where he got that from‚•πlol‚•πimo facebook can do whatever the hell they want, its a free market; regardless of whether or not its a bad thing, it doesn't break the law
cuz there is no law saying I have to spread your messages
and last i checked
facebook is not congress
at least i hope not‚•πagreed
i tend to forget that argument but yes
you probably would legally sink in a court battle since they aren't the government‚•πThey cant if they are a monopoly \
the government sets standerds for monopolys to uphold basic constutional libertys
and free speech is one of them
I know I need a strong acid and week conjaguate base‚•πYup‚•πbut most of them hav strong acids‚•πYea isnt it strong acid weak conjugate base‚•πye‚•πOr weak base strong conjugate acids‚•πwait it is week acid and strong base
but how u kno what is weak base‚•πIf its not in the list‚•πo lol‚•πHow many questions does the practice have?

yea
it is‚•πOh god‚•πbut like practice tests r ushally longer‚•πStill tho‚•πalso I found cool chart from dr pernia website‚•π19/20ish questions is going to be a time crunch
Oooo yes
Thats nice chart‚•πyea it is going to suck
I need gud grade on dis test cuz I dident do so well on the last one‚•πI just need to not fail‚•πerwin chargoff‚•πconfusion 9000‚•πIts starts low
So its strong base to a weak acid
U have the right idea the wording is a bit different‚•πwhy wouldent the curve b inverted‚•πIt starts below ph 7
So that means it is a acid‚•πthey bolth start below ph 7‚•πThis starts at 14‚•πhmmm‚•πLook how he mentions it
Strong base - weak acid‚•πO
OOOO‚•πSo the solution has a strong base‚•πOOOOOO
i am dumb‚•πSo its ph is 14
Yes very‚•πbruhh this test is not lookin so hot‚•πIt is not‚•πbruhh‚•πlol the french students made a group chat
and chose to exclude me
because i don't have imessage‚•πah yes‚•πbecause i don't have access to their inferior messaging platform‚•πwell it may be inferior
but its one of the most popular‚•πits a corporate scheme
i don't like corporate schemes to coax the public‚•πit works
it may be a scheme but apple‚Äôs got a way
of marketing it‚•πlook once they make their messaging app cross-platform
then maybe ill consider it‚•πfacetime because cross-platform kinda
imessage probably wont‚•πlol u make it all turn green‚•πfacetime is not really cross platform
you can start a facetime call on an iphone

the lights went out
then
the wifi router still had a little juice left in the psu
which was enough for duo to transfer a video of the lights being out‚•πthats really good
i havent tested any enough to make a decision
facetimes been decent whenever i used it
duo was interesting on a call to california
whatsapp video is decent

if u be like me‚•πyeah very hard‚•πhonestly‚•πis it like h chem hard‚•πharder‚•πharder‚•πhardest class at ridge easily‚•πfuk‚•πmuch harder than chem
well
it depends
on what ur good at
i find it harder than chem‚•πap physics 1 is the easiest class at ridge‚•πI good at physiks‚•πor calc‚•πtbh‚•πphysics actually makes sense‚•πif i got a 90 instead of an 89 mp3‚•πi stopped failling science‚•πand did not get a 52 on the last test
i would be doing really well

cy's recommended‚•πHow do dis?
got it
My calculator was having a meltdown‚•πthat's like
literally flask
no actually it is a little nicer
flask is already dead simple‚•πif you could stand next to this all the time or next to flask all the time who would you choose‚•πbut i guess this is a little simpler for APIs
idk ive only known it for like 90 seconds
i have to redo 2 of my precalc homeowrks
cuz i did the wrong ones‚•πlol
i do that‚•πso i did more ellipse work rather than hyperbola work
and then i realized
shoot
what is a hyperbola
i must have messed up my homework
maybe ill try fastapi‚•πcyAPI‚•πl8r‚•πcylask‚•πi was gonna write my own fastapi‚•πsame‚•πbut then i was like
flask is already pretty much as easy as it gets
so‚•πyou should add the cyifier to the bot if you get a chance monsieur l'usb‚•πd'accord

i am procrastinating chem and hush
so i must do work‚•πi dont really know what im doing for my projects
have fun‚•πwhen u r working on Gatsby and realise that it is 12:23‚•πwhy is this an acid‚•πcause its a per-something-ate
which is one of the acid naming things‚•πare per-something-ates always strong acids‚•πidk about strong acids
but they will be acids‚•πwait
but that means that
HIO4
is a strong acid
wait‚•πidk about that
but its an acid‚•πno no hold on‚•πnope
its not a strong acid‚•πHIO4 has to be a strong acid
or it won't work‚•πits not‚•πthen how does this work?‚•πwait no its a strong one
we dont need to know it for class tho‚•πhe said this
you react it with water‚•πHBr
HI
HClO4
HClO3
H2SO4
HNO3
HCl‚•πand the 2 products‚•πthats all u need to know for strong acids‚•πok but then how am i supposed to solve this problem
without knowing that‚•πwhat problem?‚•πthe one i showed you
i asked him about this during class
and he said
you react it with water‚•πthis one?‚•πand you examine the 2 products
yes
and you see
if the base is strong
and the acid is strong
if only the acid is strong
the solution is acidic
if only the base is strong, the solution is basic
if they are the same‚•πdude‚•πthe solution is neutral‚•πfor that problem
its just the naming
its not asking strong or weak
its just asking is it nuetral, acidic, or basic‚•πyes‚•πthe name of it‚•πbut
this has no name
but because CaOH is a strong base
and H2CN2 is a weak acid
CaCN2 is a base‚•πyea for that
u react with water and find out the stuff‚•πbut so ur saying i can determine if it's an acid based on the name
if i am given it?‚•πyup‚•πwhere did it say that‚•πin one of the things
if its a hydroxide
its a base
there r a bunch of stuff that if u have the name u can see if its acid or base pretty quick‚•πhuh‚•π-ous is usually an acid
there r more‚•πhmm
bicycle‚•πcyfinfaza: birameshcle‚•πRidge comp cy club

should i go for a fourth
i def can‚•πU got the email?
Sure‚•πnot yet‚•πSteal some money‚•πso far ive embezzled 120 dollars‚•πHaha‚•πno
90
then 120
ok ill be needing another protonmail acc‚•πwait
does protonmail not let u alias ur email
cause u could just make one email
and make like 500 aliases for it‚•πmaybe
but this is easier
i just made another proton
done
fourth‚•πimma ask you a couple things if u dont mind‚•πThis is not a a valid buffer system, because HPO$^2- is not a valid acid because acids don't have charges, therefore it is not  a buffer system.
Akhil
Mira‚•π?‚•πnothing‚•πokay then its not what i thought it was‚•πDo yo understand thou‚•πyea‚•πBecuase acids don't have charges‚•πyea‚•πbecuase they are covalent‚•πmakes sense
idk what the relationship between the two could be then‚•πNone
There was no relationship‚•πno there is
they are conjugates of each other‚•πWhat?‚•πthis should be reversed PO4^3- is the conjugate base of HPO4^2-‚•πThey both have negative charges, so they can't be conjugates of anythig
oh
yea I guess
Depending on the equation‚•πwell
it will always be
cause itll always be H3PO4 + H2O‚•πchem test
right‚•πYup‚•πgood luck
if you haven't taken it already‚•πPanic‚•πnah ur good‚•πno
bc akash words‚•πYea i figured
Idk then
I believe its just a ionization ka
The ph of this individual ionization is 12.7‚•πAkhil has an addiction‚•πlol‚•πMe: okay...
Me: uhhhh
Me: no thanks.
theres a us census for a reason‚•πyea
its to collect that data
but
this is trying to collect a specific sample of people‚•πlol google anaylitics on a hush project‚•πooo‚•πI am arguing agenst big tech

This is interesting
The fact that hdds hav gotten this fast‚•πit kinda works now‚•πGood‚•πWait should I be a company representative or an environmental/engineering researcher‚•πidk
I think it is good‚•πwhats the difference between carbone and charbon
i think i know‚•πcharcoal
carbon
well the other way around
carbone is carbon
charbon is charcoal‚•πah
ok
ok one suggestion the last sentence maybe
maybe not tout les probl√®mes idk
that seems unrealistic
but it seems good to me even tho i dont take french lol‚•πWhat about this tho
What would be more ethos‚•πresearch engineer‚•πWhat would be the official title tho
Like engineering researcher for the French association of energy?‚•πSamantha Deane, Head Environmental Engineer of Le Petit Soleil
whatever
idk
what is le petit soleil
i thought it was the company‚•πRandom made up company‚•πyeah that works
just keep it as of the company
if u wanna make life simple‚•πTHE HELL IS THIS NEW HITFILM EXPRESS LOGO
why
why did they change it to that
it soo ugllylylyly‚•πIdk
Hitfilm started to go downhill for me‚•πuse
resolve
free davinci resolve‚•πi know how to use hitfilm
maybe i'll use resolve next time
yeah...‚•πthis is an absolute problem‚•πThe reason‚•πlol you used disallowed plugins‚•πI stopped using hitfilm‚•πidk maybe I should use resolve
but I'm already mostly done in hitfilm‚•πI DIDNT USE ANY FKING PLUGINS HOLY S*********‚•πis it running in demo mode‚•πofc it is‚•πImma use adobe premier‚•πok akhil‚•πhow much does that cost buddy?‚•πIdk
The school pays for it i think‚•πwindows is dying i think imma have to reboot
maybe its a bad idea to open 50 apps at once‚•πThats how i have photoshop and illustrator for free
Very‚•πi have no more start menu
or task bar‚•π$20 a month akhil
what are other free alternatives‚•πUh resolve
^
Those the two big free ones i think‚•πI should try resolve
But I can't imagine it's that much easier than hitfilm
Honestly‚•πfree‚•πWindows photos‚•πpermiere is free
you can get it with the school
yes akhil is right‚•πYup‚•πPC iMovie‚•πlol
i just use resolve‚•πI'm waiting for my computer to reboot‚•πResolve or Premiere those r ur two best bets‚•πtoday my spanish teacher was playing the most GOD-AWFUL music
^^
i have EVER heard in my LIFE‚•πIsnt that‚•πLike what‚•πidk what it was‚•πEvery spanish teacher?‚•πsomeone said it was shakira‚•πOh god‚•πnah rabouin actually played decent music
i actually had the gall to go and look up one of them and i still listen to it sometimes‚•πNot this year‚•πi keep hearing it
and it makes me want to legit like
throw up
it's not even music
oh btw‚•πcy what music should i use‚•πthe music was in english
kicker‚•πor ig anyone‚•πOh damn
Lofi
No question about it‚•πbut like where tho
also its technically and ad
an(
an*‚•πgo to YouTube audio library
find something‚•πDoes it need to be dmca free?‚•πnope its for school‚•πthis song is just like
video game music lol‚•πIf not, just download lofi mp3
Or that‚•πdo what kahil says‚•πOr movie music‚•πor listen to it‚•πAnything by Zimmer is good‚•πDID YOU GUYS NOT SEE MY PRESENTATION THIS MUSIC DOESNT FIT AT ALLLLLLL
like its good
but
not at all fitting‚•πok you wanna hear my music‚•πill see it
why
are there random piano noises‚•πI dont start it at the very beginning‚•πor is that me
hitfilm
screw hitfilm‚•πits hitfilm demo
lmfao‚•πyeah i figured
i can barely hear it since piano
id get some cringy ambient music
lemme see if i have some for u‚•πOr lofi‚•πsam listen to my music‚•πLight lofi sounds great‚•πthat's they style you want I think‚•πeh‚•πNO STOP‚•πYES‚•πNOT THAT‚•πYES
YES‚•πlol‚•πNO‚•πYES
YES
YES‚•πITS
PERFECT‚•πAMAZING RIGHT
YES‚•πactually this version is different
its ok‚•πTOTALLY FITS‚•πbut um
actually idk for sams video‚•πakhil hes talking about solar panels‚•πhonestly‚•πand how‚•πWait‚•πenvironmental problems can be solved by solar panels
ok‚•πThat music fits well‚•πhe is trying to sell something
do it sam‚•πThis is also great‚•πthose are actually not bad for trying to sell something‚•πit shall be used‚•πnoice‚•πYes‚•πi think the second one is a bit better in a voiceless ad‚•πhave you ever watched CNBC documentaries on youtube‚•πYea‚•πheres another one‚•πThat is oddly specifc‚•πlouis rossmann‚•πlisten to the music
its like
that kind‚•πhow about this
now im just trolling‚•πI need to get out of this chat and finish my video‚•πd'accord
adieu
monsieur
l'usb
i ahve more meme songs‚•πwait so pixelate?‚•πWhy not‚•πor which song should i use‚•πYea its good‚•πdecent yea
also copyright free iirc
but i pirated off of the stock sounds site‚•πbruh its for school it dont matter‚•πyeah
the video where i found it tho
like‚•πi need some like somewhat grandiose music for the end tho
what should i use for that‚•πuh
you could selectively use the same pixelate music
like get a chunk that ends at a grandiose part
also
i have grandiose music‚•πU could also selectively use movie music‚•πtbh
samuel‚•πThose usually have really grandiose parts‚•πyou can just use this pheonix thing
it would probably work
for the entire thing probably
it creates urgency/tension needed for climate change
remember thjis‚•πgodammit I forgot about that stupid snapshot directory error
with hitfilm
i should really stop using hitfilm‚•πresolve‚•πthat said it is working now
so i am fine‚•πis this ok? pls send any comments/criticisms :)‚•πit sounds decent
the ending is also fine since it leaves off with the panels
my french listening skills are garbage but it sounded mostly understandable as well but i cant tell you any details‚•πight all i want for this is a B so ill take it‚•πok nice video
the only thing its missing is those doodly animations
but other than that
solid french
solid ethos pathos logos
this is my current video‚•πBro how is urs 115 mb ü•¥‚•πlol idk‚•πMine was like 30
Although tbf mine is also in 1080 24 FPS‚•πi exported to "YouTube 1080p HD"
whatever that means
probably like 1080 30p with medium compression
huh
hitfilm's file format is just XML
so i could technically just write python code to make my video for me‚•πi could write a bash script
for ffmpeg
to make videos‚•πyeah but that doesn't have a gui‚•πhandbrake‚•πlol‚•πhandbroke‚•πlol‚•πwhy though
i mean
okay
i get it
it's a video
you are listening to Cy‚•πcy is starting to hate hitfilm
its being bad
its like
how do you move the anchor point wihout moving the image
you
move the anchor point
then move the image back
akjsdflakjsdhfs‚•πresolve‚•πcan resolve open hitfilm projects
tbh im done anyway
ill use resolve next time
ok it has some motion and an accent on Arr√™tez
that's it
im done
...with the video

nah shes not gonna accept that
it is very accurate tho
yes
imma make a transliterator website
powered by epitran
cuz its so ez
i bet i could get it done in less than 30 minutes
although that would be not fun
so maybe ill make it with Svelte
or ill learn how to use bootstrap once and for all‚•πdoesnt epitran
have a non ipa options
also why the HELL does your french teacher want a pronunciation guide
guid√©e‚•πcdknight: guided‚•πlol‚•πwdym‚•πlike
the
wait
let me make epitran work one sec‚•πok‚•π/a É…õte/
IPA
actually nvm
what should it be
ash uh tay‚•πidk
tbh
if i give her a transliteration‚•πwhat why does she want a pronunication guide like what
why
is this going to be read by non-french speakers‚•πso we pronounce things right‚•πl'YUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUESSSSSSSSSSSSBIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII‚•πcyfinfaza: l'YUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUSSSSSSSSSSIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII‚•πso like that?‚•πlol yes
no i think imma give her the epitran transliteration‚•πlol‚•πcuz technically all she wants is a "phonetic script"‚•πtheres probably a program for that‚•πI just have to replace the numbers with their spelled out forms
and then put it into epitran
then I will add a note that the thing was made with epitran
WHY TF ARE MY LIGHTS FLICKERING

but its really bad today‚•πIts it cause it was raining/lightning?‚•πidk
probably not
see the controller runs of power from my pc
over a usb extension cord
so i plugged it directly into a battery bank to see if that was the problem
but it still flickered
so its something to do with either the MOSFET or the psu
or some of the wires
frankly ill just turn off the lights
i dont need them anyway‚•πHello darkness my old friend‚•πHey Ramesh
What did Zande say about how to write the Schindler list film review
Like he said we had to think about it differently than other prompts‚•πI believe he said
To write in the context of the holocaust for the movie‚•πhow is schindler's list history
that was what he said
he said
multiple things‚•πYea it was something weird like that‚•πyah its historical impact‚•πThank god its due monday‚•πim gonna due it tmrw

Do any of the iphone ppl know how to make iphones play m4a‚•πWhat?
M4A is one of the native formats‚•πYeah thats what's weird‚•πDownload it to files and try that way‚•πThats what we did
This is all it let's us do‚•πThen itunes/music‚•πHow do you put it in music‚•πNot sure
All my music gets moved over‚•πHmm
Idk
Apparently the file was created on a huawei
So maybe it's a codec issue‚•πShouldnt be‚•πIt plays on my phone‚•πAll forms of m4a work on ios‚•πHmm‚•πU could
Try emailing it to youself
And opening it that way
Otherwise just send it to a laptop and open it there‚•πWe tried that as well
It didn't work
But now‚•πThats weird‚•πI installed VLC
And that can play it‚•πIdk then‚•πIdk either
But it works
So it's fine‚•πYea‚•πwhat u do is
go to the store

hi im cy
false‚•πBonjour, je m‚Äôappelle Cy, et je t'√©cris de ma classe fran√ßais 3 H. J'√©cris cette lettre dans Google Docs, alors il va y avoir des fautes qu‚Äôil trouve, et alors cette lettre repr√©sente comment j'√©cris quand je suis sur un ordi. Quand j'√©cris sur le papier je fais plus de fautes grammaticales et orthographiques. Je veux commencer avec quelque chose √† propos de comment j‚Äôai commenc√© avec le fran√ßais. Quand j'√©tais petit, ma maman me parlait en fran√ßais tout le temps. Elle et libanaise, alors d‚Äôou elle vient, ils parlent l‚Äôarab premi√®rement, mais ils parlent aussi le fran√ßais beaucoup et aussi l‚Äôanglais un peu. Mais quand j‚Äôai entr√© l'√©cole √©l√©mentaire, les enfants me parlaient en anglais, et alors mon progr√®s avec le francais √† arret√©. J‚Äôai d√©m√©nag√© √† Basking Ridge en 7th grade, et je devais choisir une langue √† prendre. J‚Äôai d√©cid√© que j‚Äôallais prendre le francais parce que je commen√ßais une ann√©e en retard, et je connaissais d√©j√† le fran√ßais. J‚Äôai aussi beaucoup de famille qui parle le fran√ßais, alors √ßa allait m‚Äôaider √† leur parler. Aujourd'hui, j‚Äôai encore des probl√®mes orthographiques et avec la conjugaison, mais pas aussi mauvais que quand je commen√ßais. Rappelez-vous - j‚Äôai commenc√© une ann√©e en retard, et je ne savais pas du tout comment lire ou √©crire le fran√ßais. Mais, il y a aussi des choses avec lesquelles je suis encore tr√®s performant: des choses comme la compr√©hension, et le masculine/feminine.
Je veux aussi parler √† propos des choses auxquelles je suis int√©ress√©. J‚Äôaime vraiment les ordinateurs. Je fait beaucoup de sites-web, et d‚Äôautres programmes, et j‚Äôaime aider les profs et les √©tudiants avec leur ordinateurs. Cette ann√©e j‚Äôai pris la course AP Computer Science, ou on a juste fini nos projets. Mon projet √©tait un site web ou tu peux jouer √† un jeu de Blackjack avec l‚Äôordinateur. Je l‚Äôai fait avec mon ami. Mais j‚Äôai aussi fait beaucoup d‚Äôautres sites web, comme un qui te laisse √©crire des programmes en Java et les faire marcher pour pratiquer et te teste pour le AP test. Cet √©t√© j'esp√®re que je vais pouvoir travailler avec un ami de ma famille. Sa compagnie veut utiliser des technologies comme ReactJS dans leur sites web, et alors je veux leur aider. J‚Äôaime aussi la musique, mais beaucoup moins que j‚Äôaime les ordinateurs. Je jouais du piano, mais j‚Äôai arr√™t√© apr√®s que ma ma√Ætresse a d√©m√©nag√©. J'√©coute encore beaucoup de musique. 
Maintenant la p√©riode ici va finir, alors je vais devoir fermer cette lettre. Je suis surexcit√© pour l‚Äô√©t√©, mais aussi pour rentrer √† l'√©cole en Septembre. J‚Äôattend de pouvoir te rencontrer l'ann√©e prochaine (sauf si tu es Madame Koch, dans ce cas j'attends de pouvoir te revoir). A l‚Äôann√©e prochaine!
-Cy‚•πNah I‚Äôm not reading that‚•πsend yours‚•πThat‚Äôs too much
I didn‚Äôt do mine in google docs‚•πlol‚•πFml‚•πwhat is fml‚•πIt would have been free in google docs‚•πwhat does that stand for‚•πFuck my life‚•πah
ok noted
lol this helped my grade
from a C- to a C+‚•πbruhh‚•πthats not bueno‚•πlol this why u do algebra
and u no need 2 year of calc‚•πyea as long as u get AB done u should be good‚•πima do bc
cuz u can go from h precalc
to bc‚•πyea‚•πppl say don't do that
they say its really bad‚•πo‚•πif ur confident in ur skills u go ahead‚•πthen ima do ab‚•πcalc bc in high school is really bad‚•πwhat is diff of ab and bc‚•πyou need ab stuff‚•πab is the first part‚•πto do bc‚•πbc is the second‚•πo‚•πid say
do whatever ur teacher recommends for u‚•πima prob take it in coolage anyways cuz like there is no way around another calc class‚•πtrue
i can only take AB
so im thinkin of doubling up AB and stats or smthing‚•πoooo
u should do stats senior year‚•πthats the plan‚•πcuz that class is ez right‚•πuh compared to calc yea‚•πye
lol my senior year gonna suck
ima go shit ton ap classes‚•πidk i first have to get past calc and take some stupid exam next year‚•πprof exam?
hahahahhahahahahhaha‚•πyup‚•πprecalc project‚•πYES‚•πamazing‚•πits gonna be cancer so i gotta study like months ahead of time
its worse than SAT math testing‚•πrly
for precalc proficiency exam‚•πcalc proficiency
yea its cancer‚•πi thought it was a precalc proficiency‚•πnah i cant go up from precalc
its precalc, then calculus
then I can move up
which is kinda stupid if u ask me‚•πye
the new math superviser sux‚•πno wait
hold the fcking phone
wait thats done not up
ah i see‚•πye‚•πwait no they got rid of a pathway
from calculus to ap calc ab
normal one
welp‚•πdude‚•πguess im taking stat‚•πthat sucks‚•πit is what it is‚•πcould u take stat then ab
cuz like we could then b in da same class‚•πstat ends up being in my senior year
the new supervisor is awful‚•πyeaaa
he almost made me take a prof exam for h alg to h precalc
even tho i got gud gradez‚•πyea
its fine tho‚•πu takin cs next year‚•πuh probably econ
cause thats the major i wanna go into‚•πooo‚•πor mathematics (even tho im in a lower level thing)‚•πwhat about stats
or data sci‚•πyea mathematics/statistics
or econ‚•πsick‚•πbut idk how normal calculus will look on college apps
it shouldnt be the worst right
cause im still accelerated, but i shall make it fine‚•πye
dude we doin hush discussion
and its heated‚•πoh yea those‚•πim j sitting in my char
chair
and ppl are like yelling
and im like homieeeeee‚•πtf
why‚•πbc there are a bunch of leftists‚•πthat‚•πlike HARD
leftifts‚•πwould make sense actually‚•πthey dont know how to speak
and hav a convo
and im like bruhh
shhh‚•πyea yelling
in a discussion
in school
is kinda stupid‚•πsuper stoopid
i wish i was mediating the discussion‚•πwho is?
the teacher?‚•πwhite girls‚•πcause they r doing an awful job‚•πcuz they got a group with half the class
so hab best project
cuz there b so many ppl‚•πahh‚•πso even tho they dum
they get A+
cuz quanity‚•πthat
is stupid‚•πyea
i wish i was in apush lol
i wanna watch a movie‚•πapush is fun
yea
we watching star wars now‚•πdude
sick‚•πyea its great‚•πi am j saying a few words
and hiding
bc they start screaming at me
cuz i am only republican‚•πoh no‚•πyea....
and it on capital riot
so im like
plz halp‚•πOh no
i wish u good luck
also the reason im going abroad, cause entrance exams r better than transcripts
god damn that sent late‚•πYeaaa
I was thinking, if I were to study cybersecurity
I would study in italy‚•πwait whats the debate on?
yea thats a nice place‚•πThat‚•πcapitol riot?‚•πYea‚•πthats a weird topic for a debate ngl‚•πYe‚•πthats just asking anybody thats not the majority to get flamed‚•πBicycle‚•πanyway
im done
this
has to be the dumbest
thing
they also proved that friction was not negligible
k forget that i was stupid they explained it later but still
no context it sounds stupid‚•πthat is dum
but I think there is an explanation
bc velocity should b constant bc u are not loosing or gaining energy
right‚•πexactly
but the thing is
if the only force is earth's gravity then it will lose/gain energy‚•πwell no, bc gravity is constant, so speed will only inc until it reaches the speed of the gravity
or the force of it‚•πlike terminal velocity?‚•πye‚•πyeah ur right
but that doesnt mean it's always constant velocity‚•πwell, once it reaches terminal velocity, speed is constant
so that means that you can assume the point in time your measuring the data is at the point were friction is nothing and the object had reached terminal velocity
so yes, velocity from the point of terminal velocity onwords would be constant
and because there is no other force. ie friction, it wont be slowing down or increasing in speed at different intervals bc there is no friction
huh, this is intaresting
idk how fix
w8, I fix
it is funny cuz my computer litarly j turned on like that‚•πthis is my spanish homework guys
1. she gives homework the tuesday before school ends
2. this is what we get to watch‚•πlol‚•πlol
that's a really low score for me tho‚•πim waiting for the oracle to say "Ramesh stands next to people all the time lol"‚•πlol‚•πor worse yet
god forbid‚•πI mean
you dont know probably 30% of the ppl in this group chat
svelte is fast
like
real fast
and
its actually really nice
like
really nice
the typing test is 140 lines of svelte
svelte
you dont wanna see what that looks like in react
its like
multiple lines
of code‚•πthat shouldnt be happening‚•πyes
this is a typing test that aims for 100% accuracy
if you make a mistake
you are expected to fix it
like ur actually typing‚•πthen how come the I is marked wrong but everything after it is still green
also technically i am correct because dont is not a word‚•πwell you can make mistakes
but
not ones that offset the whole thing
also you type whatever it says
regardless of whether its a word or not
then theres this
um‚•πget rid of strings that are like 9 characters long
that just gets really annoying‚•πwdym‚•πcy gets windows 11 beta‚•πhe will
on his laptop‚•πit looks like chromeos
anyway‚•πI have not seen it‚•πhow?
insider?‚•πleaked
iso file‚•πyeah apparently like

just to make sure‚•πoof‚•πsend when u get it‚•πk‚•πill send over macos beta if anyone wants it
i also just need to get it off my drive‚•πok u send when u get it‚•πlol
i will‚•πawww‚•πmines still at 500kbps‚•πcan u not send 11gb iso files‚•π2gb is max BUT
there are ways akhil there are ways‚•πyea ill compress it‚•πindeed
i might try to zstd compress it
cy‚•πgod damn it‚•πdont compress the iso
its already compressed most likely‚•πnope
its the .app
turned into a iso‚•πcan you tell any of your friends who are coming to csc tomorrow and are eating food there to fill out the form
there are people who said they are coming and have neglected filling out this form‚•πidk who they are
i filled it out‚•πyeah
you were the first to‚•πAyyyyy
Wow that's so fancy!!!!‚•πikr‚•πI just plant them into the ground‚•πlol
we were gonna do that‚•πLike clear a patch of land‚•πbut‚•πPutnam fence around it‚•πthen we would have to put up stuff‚•πAnd plant
Yeah that's what we did
It's annoying
Cause field mice killed 5 of my plants already‚•πwe have 13 lol‚•πAnd I have this intricate dewatering system
Yep your welcome
I have 24
Excluding the 5 dead ones‚•πi see
im worried we killed them by not planting them correctly‚•πIt's not good‚•πthe roots were very small‚•πLol you wont
Ya know how I transplanted them?‚•πand they were falling over‚•πI pulled them out‚•πlol‚•πLike literally
Just plucked them out and replanted them
They're still alive‚•πyeah we pretty much did that but a bit more carefully‚•πThey fall over on the first night
They'll come back up by tomorrow morning‚•πi see
good to know‚•πAnd fyi only transplant right before sundown or else they might die‚•πwhy‚•πCause they need the night to adjust‚•πinteresting‚•πNo roots = no water‚•πwell we just transplanted them‚•πNice!‚•πactually only 5 of them
were gonna do the other ones tmrw‚•πNow go drench them with water
Like really water them
Like a lot‚•πthe problem is we put water on them
and they fell over‚•πOh
Yeah
Not on them
Into the soil‚•πwell no on the soil
and then the soil expanded
and they unfastened‚•πOh...
Plant them deep
Like literally have the lowest leaf  1 cm above the soil‚•πhmm
ok we didn't do that
will do that later‚•πYou see the hairs on the side of the main stem?‚•πyeah‚•πThose can become roots‚•πooo
did not know that‚•πSo the deeper you plant them the more roots there are that can grow
So yeah don't be afraid to plant them deeper‚•πok
i will tell my mom that tmrw
we will bury them deeper‚•πOr just pile more soil around them‚•πtrue‚•πEither way works! üôÇ‚•πimma upload the monterey iso‚•πk nvm‚•πum‚•πi thought it was going to be different than this‚•πuse notcy‚•πi need somewhere to upload this 14gb iso‚•πnotcy
74bluepineapples‚•πur gonna need to rise the limit up
its 14gb‚•πwait
yeah
hold on‚•πyea make the max like 20 or so‚•πmy options are 1, 5, 10, and unlimited‚•πah unlimited then‚•πlol ok
or
ipfs
the software specifically designed for this
large file sharing over the internet
akhil
put it on ipfs
that would be cool
also ramesh
put it on ipfs
i want windows 11‚•πi could
its gonna take forever
so ill just offload the iso somewhere else‚•πif you put it on ipfs
there is no reuploading time‚•πyea but done i have to host it on my comp?
or can i upload it and get rid of it‚•πu have to host it
until the person downloads it‚•πugh this is annoying‚•πright I have to get lunix setup
not lunix
dolphin emulator‚•πlol i have 278 tabs open
i love vertical tabs
is that download done‚•πues
wait
I wish to talk to banjamin
QmatjGJU2Z1HnXgVZmFVMzvnYAeob4cSNNsChsPSytDNH5
cid?
lmk if you can‚•πthx
downloading‚•πhow slow is it‚•πlike 25 minutes‚•πyeah around that‚•πok this is
faster
than it was for cy or me‚•πand the best part about ipfs
is it only gets faster
this is the sketchiest thing I have ever had in my downloads‚•πcy is downloading my zipped school folder‚•πlol‚•π50%
got like 7 minutes left‚•π85% got about 1 min left‚•πyea i was on discord while downloading
so it went kinda slow‚•πim using native ipfs
i think ur using the gateway
right‚•πyea probably
im just downloading off the link‚•πim using the ipfs client‚•πah i should
but im lazy to download it
3 minutes‚•πlol my usb ports dont work for some reason
it wont mount the usb drive‚•πlol
hows it going with the dl‚•πalso etcher says it doesn't have a partition table‚•πyes‚•πwindows never has a table‚•πsince u cant flash windows
with etcher‚•πu need someother tool‚•πyou have to use something else
exactly
except it always works on vms‚•πthere was a really good one for windows
i forget‚•πi think the official one MAY work with an ISO
idk‚•πnah even normal windows doesnt work
i am 96 with like 50 seconds left
and done‚•πbooting the vm‚•πwait you have to install it
?‚•π?
its an iso
so u gotta go through the entire thing‚•πbut i think
it would offer an upgrade route‚•πwhen its official‚•πi dont have enough space
lets see why‚•πit's installing rn‚•πi need to clear some space
cy's downloads folder‚•πlol
lol
lol
lol
lol
lol
it uses IE
lol
isn't that IE dropdown
literally
lol
ooh blur
also why does that font look like cyfont‚•πhow big should i make the storage‚•πthe UI is
inconsistent.
wtf is this awful ms paint
lol rounding inconsistent
internet explorer is not included
yeah this is basically like a windows whistler preview lol
it's of that quality‚•πim currently attempting installation‚•πthat
doesnt look bad
kinda expected cause eol is next year i think
how come ur corners aint there
widgets huh‚•πlol‚•πLol‚•πJavaScript at its finest‚•πYes
Please join for free child labour
Thx‚•πWhen google starts recommending you the MDN docs‚•πi get recommended random stuff‚•πfilancial niteracy‚•πyes
its such a hassle‚•πhi my name is javascript‚•πgl typing that
at least there aint no spaces
u should also prob
make wpm reflect accuracy
instead of raw typing speed‚•πwpm reflects wpm
if you want one relative to the accuracy
you look at the bars
on the graph
they are based on acpm
adjusted characters per minute
which is the actual unit you want‚•πYup‚•πHey guys
I need a secondary drive
What should I get
I already have the Samsung 970 evo 1 rn
Tb not rn*‚•πprobably get a hard drive
if you want a lot of storage
or get like
a cheap ssd
like a micro center one
also sam‚•πAll I need is 1 rn
Tb*‚•πdid you give me back my gpu
that I lent you‚•πNo don‚Äôt think so
Lemme get it rq‚•πjust bring it over sometime
its not urgent‚•πRight here üôÉ‚•πlol
ok
whenever you have time
just text me
and you can drop it off‚•πWhat‚Äôs a good, cheap ssd
Samsung 860/870?‚•πnot a samsung
get a sabrent
or a micro center/inland premium‚•πHow is this one‚•πthats similar to what I have
mine was cheaper tho
lemme send
cheaper and it seems to work well so‚•πvercel is pronounced ver-cell for the record
i just checked‚•πhow else would it be said‚•πver-sull‚•πverc√©l‚•πpeople really say it like that?‚•πi was saying it like that
like
versal‚•πits cel so it makes like a cell sound
idk
ive been saying like that‚•πregardless
its pronounced ver-cell‚•πcompanies ought to put pronounciation things somewhere‚•πlol
huh
these appear to be my symptoms
my lights are doing kinda that
hmm
when it dies it sends out a message with why it reset
cause 4 is apparently a reset initiated by the hardware watchdog timer
314 days of uptime‚•πPlease
Update and reboot‚•πI'm going to 16 handles
Apparently it's an ice cream shop
In case anyone wanted to also go there‚•πFOOOOOOOOOOOD‚•πfeu‚•πMy network infrastructure did not recover after the 6 hour power outage at my house
Something is broken‚•πHoly cow u have had so many power outages the past couple months‚•πNo we were having a generator installed
So they had to stop the power for 6 hours‚•πAh that makes sense‚•πHaproxy is not dead
I officially hate onsite hosting
What is this
Why
ah that's why
my ip address changed‚•πYea thats always kinda a hassle‚•πwell it hasn't changed in like a year
so i thought it would never change‚•πBut i contacted my isp and just told them to try and never change it‚•πi should do that
or
hear me out
not use onsite hosting.‚•πU could
Its easier for me‚•πalthough i kinda have to
for certain things
meh
lemme go to my dns and change all my entries
oh my god this is going to take a while‚•π‚Ä¶
Oh god
Welp have fun‚•πill just only change the relevant ones
i should maybe use ddns‚•πThis might be why u use a dynamic thing like no-ip‚•πyeah
i had that
but they waneda make me pay
alternatively
i could just write my own‚•πU could‚•πthat identifies if my IP changed
and then contacts cloudflare‚•πtheres an api
on cloudflare
you can write you rown‚•πyeah
alternatively
i could just make one domain
and then cname all the rest of them to it
so i only have to change one‚•πThat plus whatever u said above
Is the best way‚•πyeah
i think i can free my vultr tho
and host some stuff there
cuz um
vercel can host playtools
even tho its server side rendered
i will cname everything to that
wait cloudflare has fancy options
for programmatically doing this‚•π^^^‚•πyeah but this is much easier
i just download them
find and replace
all a with cname
then reupload it
goddamit fck you wtf i just
i just
a;sdlkfja;sldkfja;slkdfj;asldkfj
now i
now i have to go and
delete them all
again
anafsdfa;lsjidkhf lakjsdhf alsdkfh‚•πAh yes‚•πsmh
maybe i should use the cloudflare api
but it would still take less time to do it this way‚•πIt would
Idk i wanna actually finish up my websites this summer‚•πI AM GOING TO FCKING KILL SOMEONE
IT DID IT AGAIN‚•πDude
Just add geo1‚•πi got rid of it‚•πTf‚•πhold on
dammit they have to have a period at the end
its ok
i will be fine
everything will be fine
*sigh
ok my sites are now back up‚•πNice‚•πwoah woah woah
do you want me to report you to telegram‚•πcdknight: fire‚•πwhen you drill a hole through your samsung and it still kinda works‚•πgold
HA‚•πRAMESH?;?!?!?!??
Wait that's Ramesh right‚•πYup
The one and only‚•πWhat‚Äôs a good normal ssd
the nvme one would force my gpu to blast hot air onto my psu
Also how do uou clean out pc dust lmao‚•πur case has filters
take them off
and wash them
with water
then dry them
that usually works for me
especially your psu filter
that one is on the bottom
and it gets real bad real fast
my pc was being very loud
so i cleaned it
and now its quiet‚•πIght thx
What abt the ssd‚•πidk
samsung is not bad
also sandisk
or maybe wd
or inland
the main difference is going from nvme to not nvme
the brand doesn't matter that much
it might affect longevity tho
so like
if you want it to last a while‚•πThis will be my secondary drive‚•πmaybe get a samsung‚•πHow‚Äôs this ^‚•πgood
its like $10-20 more than the others but its a samsung so it will last longer probably‚•πu should also clean/wash your hdd/ssd
it makes it faster
just soak it in water for some time
ideally remove the case to clean out the chips a bit as well
it gets rid of the corrosion and whatnot
at the end u should throw it in an oven to clean it out‚•πRemember to pull the chips off before putting it in the oven
Or else the water under them won't dry‚•πu can also eat the chips
they taste better than potato chips imo
but then ur ssd wont work
but they taste GOOD
i also recommend dipping them in Magic Smoke
nvidia bread
wrong chat‚•πi now have
a testimonial‚•πisnt that like some geometry dash/impossible game song
i feel like ive heard it before
and I want to know what the song actually is‚•πCrazy train
Ozzy osborne‚•πah
ramesh know songs

all the prime day deals are trash‚•πis it prime day‚•πyes‚•πyes
buy a quail egg peeler‚•πquail egg peelers are too expensive‚•πshould I buy it ^^^^‚•πwhy do you need it tho‚•πi mean‚•πkvm‚•πyea its a nice camera
but
u need to pay like 80$ on top of that‚•πfor the lens no?‚•πyea‚•πalso I already have an okish camera‚•πi mean if u want to upgrade thats not a bad deal
hate the color
but thats not a bad deal i think‚•π"women's color" probably‚•πi mean
anybody can wear it
its just a more of would u‚•πi dont really care
but then again
im not in the market for headphoens at the moment‚•πim not really either
but i might‚•πwait
this
is what I was asking about buying‚•πoh yea
thats not bad‚•πit might be low quality tho
not that i care for what im trying to do with it‚•πwell it has pretty good ratings
i mean u can buy and try it
if its bad then return it‚•πno
they say it's bad
33 dollars for the other thing‚•πmany eggs‚•πlol‚•πlol I j bork my phone
and lcd bork
and like bruhh
this is like my 6th phone bc of me
being a dumbass‚•π‚Ä¶.
how?‚•πDon't get the ifixit
Those are like 2x $
Go on ebay
Comes with a frame and everything‚•πYay‚•πx pensive
I droped it on my patio in the one area where the screen was not protected by the case cuz infinity displays
mico is learning mapbox
and after 100000 errors
I got kinda something
i still dont know tf i am doing
when u think things are going well‚•πjoin‚•πahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh‚•πwould u join the military‚•πmaybe air force‚•πoooh‚•πor...‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..space force‚•πu know in the military they have those parts that do technology stuff
with computers and whatever‚•πyea‚•πim pretty sure it exists
yeah‚•πthat is what I would wanna do‚•πi would probably join that if I had to
yeah
but i wouldnt be opposed to joining the military‚•πi would join airforce recherch labrotory‚•πi bet no one would expect that out of me‚•πi was thinking of doing rotc in collage
and u become officer in airforce‚•πmm interesting
i dont know too much about it‚•πbut like, only hav to do 4 years of 'service' witch is j recherch‚•πi doubt my parents would let me join the miltary in any form
seems not bad‚•πye
but
idt it is nessassary
cuz it would hold u back in private industry
or
like u could make connections
cuz u work with private industry‚•πtru
or u could just
work there for the entirety of life
and then retire after the x yearse‚•πu no make monee‚•πyea but
does the us have lots of benefits for exmilitary pplsz‚•πu get the same benefits even after 4 years
after 4 years is just like bruhh‚•πi mean‚•πu could make more monee in private instry‚•πtru
or just invest ur money in wsb stonks
as if
gambling works‚•πFAX
gamestonkks‚•πIKR‚•πand for some reason this works
y this work‚•πshould I hackintosh my computer for no reason
nah
gentoo install time
yep
it's gentoo install time
lol‚•πbruhh‚•πcompiling the linux kernel does fun things
now I get to do it again
since I had the fun idea of deleting my build otuput‚•πmy esp isnt working
then I find this in the code
something is calling die()
someone needs mental health support
i dont know what yet
time to manually trace through someone's code
feels a lot like
ah here it is‚•πthis is the best score ive recieved
heck yes
eh mines not a portfolio site so acessibility or seo dont matter at all‚•πwhat are u making‚•πits the highest best practices ive recieved‚•πlol‚•πa simple startpage
cause i was bored‚•πyou mean like
a new tab page‚•πyes
a startpage‚•πcool‚•πnah its too much
i just need a few links‚•πok‚•πmabye i should add a search bar‚•πim trying to make someone's LoRa Gateway firmware build and actually work on my ESP32‚•πthat would be handy
ah gl trying to do that‚•πand ramesh‚•πi first have to stop it from calling die()‚•πim doing
this‚•πcool‚•πi love this capture card‚•πimma keep working on my esp
interesting
so
its trying to read the chip's version register
and its not matching any of it's known "versions" (aka LoRa modem types)
then its die()ing
but i think it has the wrong pins
so its probably not reading anything
WAIT IT WORKED
I UNBORKED IT
AH WHAT IS IT DOINGGGGGG
ITS THROWING EVERY ERROR CODE THERE IS
all i did was change the web server port to 80
guess ill just leave it at 88
meh‚•πLibreNMS‚•πTTN wont tell me it's connected‚•πporquoi
pourquoi‚•πi think the problem is that TTN does not know which gateway is mine
i just told it i have a gateway
but i never told it which one
but then my gateway has this id
so i put it in TTN
but it still wont tell me that its connected‚•πtbh
i have no clue how this works
is this MQTT‚•πno
this is LoRaWAN
the one i sta|‚•πok cy
and still
dont know anything about lora
perhaps I should‚•πthe problem with LoRaWAN is that there are like 86 different degrees of freedom
so like
if one of them is not right
the whole thing doesn't work
cool‚•πyay bootloop‚•πlol me 3 minutes ago‚•πlol me plugging in the usb into the usbc dongle because im too lazy to find the usb ports on the back of the computer‚•πWAIT IT WORKED
IT FOUND THE GATEWAY
THE GATEWAY WAS FOUND
we're in business
now its time to actually send data
ok so apparently every other time my gateway boots up it fails due to a flash read error
good to know
TTN is driving me nuts
maybe i should just selfhost chirpstack
but then i have to figure out chirpstack‚•πim trying to make it bigger
and fullscreen
kinda‚•πIt will be the size of the container you make it in‚•πi used ur kode as like a baseline to figure out what i was doing
i did‚•πIdk then‚•πbut like, what is the css thing for the full screen‚•πOh
width 100vw
Height 100vh‚•πmuch thx, ima try that‚•πK‚•πok, that helped, but now map is like off the page
yayayya it work‚•πCool‚•πmuch thx‚•πMade by Michael Moschello
Except for post.jsx
And Map.jsx‚•πmap.jsx is no more‚•πLol‚•πpost.jsx tho
that will always b there‚•πYea‚•πMichael wrote his own kode for once‚•πHonestly as long as you make it open source‚•πyea‚•πAnd include a credit in the files where u copied my code‚•πcuz like i do volunteer thing at eec for environmental center and we kill the invasive plants and i was like, what if i make app that show where to kill plants
ye
this is like first deploy kinda thing
ima put that stuff in the readme
lol I j realized image bork‚•πreverse engineering shazam to get access to their time-synced lyrics api
I'm at the Microsoft experience center in NY
If you want me to look at anything
I can do that‚•πdid u go through the new penn station
also how is ny, is it safe or dingy now‚•πNice!!!!!!!‚•πNo we're not in that area
Seems pretty safe
Model 3 has a glass roof
So you can take pictures of the buildings‚•πoo it has a panorama?
thats cool‚•πYea‚•πthose r cool‚•πSince she had a model y‚•πYe‚•πmy nextcloud has a lock on this 250gb file I need to delete
so I look up this tutorial online
or forum post
or whatever
and it says
go into the MySQL
find the oc_file_locks table
and delete everything
except
it returns nothing
so
um
uhh
and it still says locked
lol I fixed it
then i delete the file
then i re enable file locking
oh right i forgot to say
cuz why not...
oh and i did a silverbench of the Surface Pro X‚•πself-promotion‚•πlol
im trying to get an android 12 beta build running in a vm
i wanna see the new ui
but idk how to do this
im pretty sure in order to do this i need to build from source
but idk how to do that‚•πdo you have 300gb free
you need 300gb free to build android‚•πi have like 270gb free
now that i deleted that file
apparently this is a requirement
but imma try it in wsl anyway
actually that's probably a bad idea‚•πit is‚•πcux
1. my wsl doesn't work
and 2.
idk how to launch the emulator from there‚•πWSLg‚•π?
what if i installed my GSI on a raspberry pi‚•πyou could
WSLg
does that actually work‚•πprobably not
i have a pixel 3a xl
but the screen doesn't work
so its pretty useless
and its also not unlocked
meh
imma eat dinner
bye
i was gonna send a screenshot of how much storage i have left
but
the screenshot couldnt save
WAIT
I CAN BUILD ANDROID IN REPLIT
YES
I think replit has unlimited storage‚•πhave fun with the 1 week build times
cy
get distcc
and then distributed compile it
on hundreds of replits‚•πlol
no what imma do is not build it
and just try and get my gsi working‚•πwant me to build it for you?‚•πsure‚•πok ill see‚•πok
dammit wtf is my monitor doing
its flickering like crazy
and there are lines going down it
and there is burn in
all of a sudden
i can see the ghost of my past failures in the burn in
wtf is this
like literally
out of nowhere
its just dying
also its not burn in
its like
digital image memory
it has memory of every other pixel
from one frame that was being displayed
like
5 minutes ago
and its overlaying this on the actual image
so this is why dell monitors are twice as expensive for the same thing
they dont die
unlike this HP crap
lol i guess a flickery display with lines going down it is better than no display
wait i think its still under warranty
i got it like
a few months ago
apparently this issue just goes away
whatever
ill wait
partitions are being moved
aw windows bluescreened
I guess you cant move partitions around while windows is hibernating
NTFS filesystem level compression is underrated
i just freed up 16GB
of 88GB‚•πLol
I have ZFS compression enabled by default
I think it uses LZO‚•πits only taken me until 1am to get it to build for more than 30 seconds without crashing
now it builds for 3 minutes before crashing
rainbow‚•πAh yes‚•πgenius‚•πim still trying to build android
ive given up on trying to do it on my internal ssd
im now building from my external archive hard drive
you do not understand
it took
a solid 20-30 minutes
but i think its gonna work this time
cy improvising
its kinda bad but i was only at the piano for like 10 minutes
ok building android on my archive hdd also failed
imma try it on one of my servers
acutally i cant do it on my nextcloud server
it only has 8GB ram
imma try this on the 4h server
it has 16 cores and 24gb ram‚•πi have more ram than that
and my cpu is way better
what do I do
tell me how to
I will literally do it for you
I have 12 cores of a 5900x‚•πI mean its not that hard I can tell you how to
and you can do it‚•πok tell me how to‚•πbut I also kinda wanna do it myself‚•πyou can‚•πok heres how to
one moment‚•πbtw I use arch
anyway I think I have all of those‚•πthey suggest using ubuntu‚•πim not installing ubuntu just for this
maybe ill do it in a container‚•πidk itll probably work‚•πok next‚•πoh right
or the arch equivalent‚•πok
done‚•πmake a working directory
inside the working directory‚•πok it's downloading
done‚•πok
now
this is the command that takes forever
you have to select the j count thing
number of threads‚•πok‚•πi would do like‚•π24‚•π48 or something‚•πok‚•πi did 24 on my computer‚•πi did 128‚•πthe thing is you may be network limited
so idk if it matters that much‚•πlol‚•πbasically after that
you might need to install this random thing
like
then from there its fairly straightforward
to prepare the environment
then
you have to do lunch
which will configure the build
it will show some random config info on the screen
then you run
just the letter m
and it will build it with multicore/multithreading enabled‚•πOK my computer rip
I'm getting 32gb more ram today so I think it will be good
64gb total
lol ok
ill run it with the letter m‚•πDid it finish sync‚•πlol i broke WoR
and
no
it
is
dying
my
type
ow
cannot
computer
sad
Cy
How many gbs does repo download‚•πAbout 140‚•πugh
yay
repo sync nightmare over
ok cy
I get to rebuild everything now
yay‚•πBen and I are getting ice cream
We biked on white bridge road‚•πFOOOOOOOOOOOD!!!!‚•πMicrosoft Windows
Panos Panay Edition‚•πhow do I run it
cyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
here we GOoooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOoooooooOOOooooOOOooooOOoo
ramesh is not ok clearly‚•πcool
now is it android 12
and also
how on earth are you supposed to let me use the build‚•πjfyi
it doesnt have a lock screen
what other features should I look at‚•πis it android 12‚•πipfs‚•πor android 11
no i know we could use ipfs to transfer it
but how do i run it
i have no space‚•πit's android T‚•πdoes it have the new UI‚•πum
no‚•πoh
i want the one with the new UI‚•πwtf is this‚•πi have no clue
frankly
i might just take my Mi A1
unlock the bootloader
install project treble support
and then install the android 12 beta gsi‚•πlol rip three hours‚•πlol
do you know how long i spent on this
i spent like 5 hours yesterday
i did this like 3 times‚•πlol
lol
lol im sad lol‚•πno but i think you can just checkout the android 12 beta code
the one with the new ui
and then do an incremental build
which takes less time‚•πlol tell me how‚•πthis is the step i dont know how to do‚•πlol
um‚•πim currently watching the windows event
then imma try and figure that out‚•πlol cy
sorry im gonna be blunt with u
but ur stupid
u can download the android S image from android studio
and run it in an emu‚•πlol ramesh
sorry im gonna be blunt with u‚•πlet me guess u tried‚•πbut ur stupid‚•πand im stupid
lol‚•πi tried that‚•πwhat happens‚•πits just the developer preview
no fancy new ui‚•πhmmm‚•πso far the only thing i found that has the new UI supposedly
is the GSI build
on the android website
but you need a treble compatible device‚•πcan u get it to run on a pi‚•πi dont think the pi is treble compatible
so i was like
is there a treble emu‚•πis the nexus 6p treble compatible‚•πidk hold on lemme see‚•πalso
it has the new ui‚•πwait they updated it?‚•πHAHA
lol cy‚•πlol‚•πur stupid
give it a try‚•πimma try it
which one did you pick
for the image
and which device‚•πi create new virtual device
pixel 4a
x86 images
api s
also this looks like samsung settings‚•πavd is being annoying on windows
it wants me to install some thing‚•πr/linuxmasterrace‚•πyou dont understand
yesterday
it was not asking me for this‚•π^
I do understand
the answer is lunix‚•πuntil you want touch support
until you want Bluetooth audio that works
until you want wireless displays
until you want ms office‚•πlol bluetooth audio works just fine
lol touch support and gestures work
lol whats a wireless display
lol emacs‚•πlol emacs‚•πlol emacs is best‚•πlol i had hyperv enabled
so it got mad
except
i did not enable hyperv
it enabled itself
um‚•πlol wsl‚•πwsl2 supports gui apps
on insider builds‚•πwslg
im an active member of the vGPU unlocking community
we talk about this kind of stuff a lot
cy
wanna do me a faovur?‚•πok‚•πdo u still have an install of windows on raspberry‚•πi think i do‚•πok so
can you check if you can enable hyperv
on it‚•πlol that would be interesting
i can check‚•πit would save me a lot of time
im benchmarking
esxi vs kvm (linux hypervisor) vs (now) hyperv
on a pi
interestingly
kvm takes the lead in cpu performance
easily‚•πi have my doubts about hyperv on pi‚•πit's not pi
it's aarch64‚•πok i finished watching the windows event
it was actually not bad‚•πda‚•πit was not as cringy as it could have been‚•πim watching star wars
but tell me if hyperv is enabled‚•πi will attempt that‚•πthanks‚•πi have to first find all the related items‚•πlol‚•πalso my install of windows on raspberry is like‚•πit is going to take a while for this to do things‚•πancient‚•πthis is running on a vm
ok hmm
you can try anyway if you think it's interesting‚•πbut i can still check
i could also get a new install
they have made significant improvements‚•πyou could
you should‚•πbut i muted their discord server
cuz it was annoying me‚•πit takes a bit‚•πso idk what they changed‚•πlol im in it
but you can do that
imma go watch this movie‚•πok‚•πif you do choose to do things lmk
i could just google it
last i checked it was a thing‚•πwhat is lmk‚•πlet me know‚•πok
i found my pi
lol my pi #6‚•πlol‚•πnext target
Mini HDMI to HDMI adapter
searching...
found
apparently new versions support dual displays‚•πlol mines already hooked up‚•πwhat is already hooked up‚•πmy pi‚•πmine is too
its booting
i need to find a keyboard and mouse
honestly i find it funny that they can get the latest builds of windows running on a pi
but android
nope‚•πum
is that old‚•πidk
should i try to get a new build running‚•πyes‚•πit takes so long
you have to do all this ntlite crap‚•πwell there
it took one script
to build an iso
then you just run through the WoR exe file‚•πwhere is said script
this may be the first time this phone has root
the problem is
idk what to do now
but its probably not hard to find out
I need to unlock the bootloader
now that I have root‚•πcy
you do not need root to unlock a bootloader
unless this is some kind of unofficial unlock‚•πthis is some kind of unofficial unlock‚•πlok‚•πthis is an AT&T device‚•π*lolk
good luck
im watching am ovie‚•πwhich ROM do I attempt to install tho‚•πoh
unofficial lineageos
probably
since thats all i know‚•πi need one that works for this device
G900A
by checking the device type
which in safestrap is just ""
so apparently
you can solve this by going into the install script
and deleting the line that checks for compatibility
lol
is it normal for it to sit on the splash screen for a long time after flashing a rom‚•πyes‚•πlike not the loading screen‚•πfor too long though and it would've failed‚•πthe splash screen‚•πyes
the little bubbles‚•πlike the one that says samsung‚•πkeep sliding across the screen
oh‚•πno‚•πok
yes
no
thats wrong‚•πok‚•πim still watching a movie though so‚•πok‚•πwtf
this is horrifying‚•πoh god
thats
kinda messed up‚•πshould I install custom rom on my emm ahh ehh one‚•πsure
do it‚•πi kinda dont wanna lose my data tho‚•πback it up then‚•πhow do i back all of it up
like‚•πum‚•πcuz like
if i boot to TWRP‚•πim not sure for android‚•πtheres a "backup" option
supposedly
which will take images of the partitions
but i have heard it doesn't actually back up user data
it only backs up the ROM‚•πum
idk
u would have to look into it
cause i usually just plug my phone in and press backup and sync‚•πIdk I've never used it
Use titanium backup or whatever for user data‚•πdo i have to be rooted to use that‚•πYes‚•πalso can i root or unlock bootloader without losing data‚•πNo
Lol
Back up manually is what I did‚•πhmm‚•πim crusing through my ap gov work
congressional debate did a good for me‚•πlol
i want to install custom rom on my mi a1
but i also want to back it up
and idk how to do a full backup
so what if i buy this
for $5‚•π5 dolla‚•πlink longener‚•πlol these b def stolen‚•πno custom rom‚•πlol
this actually
just adds get params
Embedded be like
want to do things?
sure, hook me up to an arduino uno
UART things‚•πlol RS232‚•πlet me tell you something
for GODS sake this should be running not systemd‚•πi am going to try and index the internet again‚•πoh gods no‚•πmy main issue last time was that my database was bad‚•πcyearch v3‚•πit was too slow
and it used too many resources
mongodb was not meant for this
so instead
ill write my own db
specifically for this purpose‚•πfoundationDB
oh right
do in person hackathons exist yet
this should not be running ubuntu‚•πlol 110MB of ram‚•πmake it run alpine or smthing‚•πbuildroot
boots up in like 2 seconds‚•πreally?‚•πis this the pinecube‚•πyes
devkit‚•πwhy is it connected to an arduino‚•πuart‚•πwhy do you need that
for the terminal?‚•πyes‚•πah
i see‚•πok now time to run ffmpeg
nah iperf3
apparently you have to wire rst and ground to disable the microcontroller
which is interesting‚•πyes
you pull RESET low
this keeps it off
then you connect your target RS232 device to the TX and RX pins in reverse
then you can connect to the device through the serial to usb converter
onboard the arduino
i have used this hack before‚•πinteresting
i am using it now‚•πwait but‚•πnot bad iperf3
for a trash ip camera‚•πyou didn't connect the ground‚•πwhat‚•πbetween the Arduino and the cube‚•πno
i didnt‚•πyou are supposed to‚•πwhy
the tutorial said not to‚•πum‚•πwell not explicitly
but why‚•πare they both plugged into the same power source‚•πno
well yes
my computer
different usb ports‚•πwell then the grounds are technically matched
but if you were to plug one of them into a different power source
then it would not work anymore
or it might
but it would be unreliable‚•πthanks for the tip
I will‚•πyw‚•πdo that
i want to benchmark this SoC‚•πok
im learning about binary search in python
so i can make my db‚•πexcellent
imma learn about systemtap
after this‚•πit needs to be able to very very quickly identify the presence or absence of an item in a list
right now the binary search can find an item in a 100 million item list in about 1ms
dont mind me
generating 1 billion random floating point numbers
idk if i even have enough ram for this
lol um
what happens now
wait it finished
ok i dont get how this works
i mean
1 billion numbers
is 1 giganumber
and if each number is about 12 digits
that would make about 12GB
no wait
that's not how math works
12 bytes is about 28 digits
hmm
okay
it would make 12GB if they were 12 character strings
lol I forgot I have to sort that list
lol it took a solid minute and a half just to find an item in it
im going somewhere this evening
hopefully its done sorting by the time i get back
i might write this in rust
can i ask you something
in this example
what happens
hmm
go vs rust
which do i choose
im reading some article
rust is faster
go has better concurrency and its easier
still sorting
maybe i should just make a list that's already sorted
or maybe i should just stop that process
bc i have lost interest in that endeavor
btw i chose go
goroutines
i wanna try a language specifically built for concurrency‚•πi found another header easter egg‚•πwhat‚•πreddit‚•πalright i dont entirely get that one
see go actually implements one of the things i was envisioning for my language‚•πelixir implements‚•πit has that command‚•πsome of the things I was envisioning for my lanugage
isn't that how you start a goroutine?‚•πyes
im not sure i entirely like goroutines yet
honestly‚•πrust async is a thing but it's bad
lol‚•πyou just say
here are 1.2 million things to do
do them please
and it just
also go doesn't have while loops
which is kinda what i had envisioned
all loops are just the same thing
JavaScript tho still has the best anonymous functions
arrow functions
mm yes‚•πWall e
On new fone‚•πlol
not the screenshot from the iPhone se?
that was my favorite wallpaper‚•πhahahaha
that was great
the only reason I had that was bc I lost the pic
and did not know how to use photoshop‚•πlol
cy is making cyrchdb
in go‚•πMichael is doing ap gov work at job‚•πlol
i should do summer assignments
but i wanna learn go‚•πu taking ap lang‚•πno
hell no‚•πyayaya
I can now b in cy class‚•πyes‚•πAww‚•πthat would b funee‚•πI signed up for it‚•πto see cy struggle through ap lang‚•πim doing AP Research‚•πur fucked‚•πIdk i might drop it later‚•πAP Research > AP Lang‚•πrly
i did deb8 instead of ap recherch and stuff‚•πyeah‚•πso now i taking ap personal finance‚•πalthough‚•πcuz i need the creditz‚•πAP Research is more of a replacement‚•πAh ap Econ‚•πbecause it is also AP‚•πye
yea and capstone‚•πI can only do Econ‚•πdid u kno we can get stuff for ied and comp sci‚•πim doing ap gov/econ‚•πand ap physics‚•πI only have one elective stuff‚•πim doing that + ap personal finance‚•πSame‚•πand ap physics‚•πim also doing ap physics
and ap calc
and ap research‚•πskary‚•πso 4‚•πi only doing 3 : (‚•πI think I‚Äôm also 4‚•πsome ppl are doing 5‚•πi could if i did no do language
those ppl have brain dead‚•πIk ppl who r doing 6‚•πsome ppl are taking 2 ap sciences
ap gov econ
ap lit‚•πI was thinking of doing 2 ap science‚•πap calc‚•πbut I need the creditz
for personal finance‚•πi do not want to take 2 sciences‚•πcuz I could not do over da summer
y‚•πi only want to have to think about one form of science at a time
also i cant
since im doing ap research
üôÇ‚•πo
i was thinking of dropping Italian for other ap class
but was like bruhh
ima do die
cuz i got h precalc
wich should b an ap class‚•πcy has to figure out how to run a package other than the main one
in go
lol
i wish i had a resource like that‚•πi mean
i am doing roket stuff this weekend‚•πüöÄ‚•πso i test
and it go maybe boom
cuz before i was like‚•πur mom is finally letting u‚•πno
my dad is‚•πah‚•πwithout telling mom‚•πlol‚•πso shhh‚•πok‚•πcuz liek
i did the calculationz
for roke
t
and was like, it not going boom‚•πok...
send video‚•πbut this is Michael math
ye def‚•πlol
Michael math‚•πits like
i forget the dumbest things‚•πcy is learning go
its interesting
not that hard‚•πMichael will go back to ap gov work‚•πok‚•πcuz i gotta do work cuz big vacation in august‚•πi see
ok
go do work‚•πbye‚•πbye‚•πmikael has job‚•π@ the pool
i was gonna work there
but‚•πCovid happened‚•πno
i just
didn't end up doing it
but to some extent‚•πI need to find volunteer things‚•πthat's fine‚•πHuh‚•πcuz like
i dont have much time anyway
and im working for that person potentially‚•πOh nice‚•πshes gonna meet with me on monday
or tuesday
lol you should look at my GitHub status
go has just lost points
it doesn't have a ternary operator
because it is "ugly"
um
excuse me
ur ugly
for making me write 5 lines of code to do the same thing i could do in one line with a ternary operator
theyre like
use if/else
but you know
you can make a ternary with if/else
that's how python does it
from what i recall rust actually does very well in this category
it doesn't have a ternary operator
but
you can use if/else and match inline
if i recall correctly
this may cause me to not use go
i use inline if statements continuously
GO IS DRIVING ME INSANE
IT DOESNT HAVE TUPLES
IT DOESNT HAVE TERNARY
who on earth designed this language
i feel like i just bought a 2021 flagship phone
i just lost a bunch of features i had in python
im gonna try rust
this is the most graphic representation of my failures I have ever seen a compiler give me
"See, this one is a &str, this one is a &str, but this last one is not! I was expecting it to be a &str like the rest of them, but instead it's a struct String. This is why it failed."
honestly
im a fan
welcome to rust
where strings are not actually strings
*yawn‚•πyeah
&str and String
one is the borrowed type and one is the boxed type
anyway
i have a question
can I use the same arduino hack we discussed on a raspberry pi‚•πYes
But you may have to enable the serial terminal
I don't think it's enabled by default‚•πapparently the UART pins are the same as the 5v pins?
also why
does EVERY tutorial say that I need some chip to use with the arduino‚•πOk no
That is not true
That is
Wrong‚•πok
then im dumb
since i came to that conclusion
this one tho‚•πIdk rn
I'm watching a movie
I can look l8r‚•πk‚•πthat said you need some chip
ok so these are the pins
these are the pins‚•πok so
i uh
I think I looked at the wrong tutorials
they were for serial from the arduino or something
but idk‚•πLol ok
ima go to sleep
Gn‚•πgn‚•πhi charles‚•πhi Cy‚•πAh welcome back‚•πhello‚•πdoes anyone want to do something
like bike
or talk
or meet somewhere
or walk‚•πuh i cant do any of those
sorry‚•πok‚•πSorry I can't do that today üòû‚•πcy will know what this is about‚•πwhen you ask for a json
like
someone
explain to me
how
how on earth
the json i want is‚•πah unicode i presume?
its probably from a db‚•πthis is the json i want
like
how can it even take up that much space‚•πeach character‚•πwell im writing a db‚•πand space‚•πwhats also kind of funny
is that it repeats
and that its not even a json
smh go
the hell is this‚•πstupid db‚•πlol
imma make go give me a json
im trying to convert an interface into a json
please dont ask me why
Bonjour, je m'appelle Marshal.
Je transformerais votre interface a un JSON‚•πcy r u trying to index the internet again‚•πyes‚•πsmh
y‚•πstop doubting me
i can do it
1200%‚•πlol‚•πonce i get go to give me a json
using the Marshal function
we are getting closer‚•πmy new bible‚•πramesh wanted me to read his bible‚•πcurse u ap gov
lol, is it the rust wiki or somthing‚•πno its Brandon Sanderson‚•πthe books he writes look interesting‚•πu should read it
they r good
akhil agrees‚•πyk what
I will‚•πstart with the way of kings‚•πye, I am gonna read
when done with English read‚•πtime to get official windows 11
lol when gmail becomes stackoverflow
windows 11 supports WiFi 6E
i thought that was just a driver-level thing
but i guess the OS also needs to support it‚•πdude
I j looked at the ap phy 1 summer assignment‚•πlol‚•πand I wanted to bash my head into a wall with the amount of work they gib‚•πyes
yes
its like
heres 50 problems
each with 4 parts‚•πand here is 50 more‚•πikr‚•πthey say 6-7 hrs to complete
but that is straight work
with no procrastonate‚•πidk imma not frontload that
bc its not actually graded
they are just gonna test us on it
apparently‚•πyea
this ez stuff
im still gonna do it‚•πim gonna do it‚•πbut not rly gonna try‚•πbut l8r‚•πye
that‚•πim updating to windows 11‚•πoooo
like fr
or j a vm‚•πon my laptop
the insider preview is available as of this morning‚•πooo‚•πfr
on actual hardware‚•πI update
ye
ye
ye
i update
wait
act‚•πdont update unless you can deal with buggyness‚•πi wanna see if it is bad
so ima wait‚•πyeah
let me update
then i tell u
if it bad
although
the thing is
it can be good
but then they can push an unstable update
and then it is bad
but then they can fix it again
this is my experience with the windows insider program
some of the builds are really good
but others not so much
you get updates about every 1-2 weeks‚•πbruhh wifi is dyig
its like the electro boom thing
with the packets
cuz i am at pool job thing
and they got bad wifi
finally
I see cy messages‚•πcy
a stack overflow is an actual bug
I started it at like 9am the day before school started
and then i found out it was optional‚•πyes ik‚•πLol‚•πhey it worked
lol
go is actually working‚•πCy will index the internet‚•πyes
he will‚•πThis is what Cy needs to listen to
While updating windows‚•πhi my name is go
i do not have named parameters
i do not have optional parameters
i do not have overloaded functions
screw you‚•πyay‚•πyes‚•πi just had to increase ram to 4gb‚•πlol
mine is at 65% of the third step
1. Download
2. Install (in os)
3. Install (from recovery)‚•πhuh
mines still fsiling to download
which is annoying‚•πim curious
how does your vm have a TPM 2.0 chip‚•πuh
it doesnt‚•πinteresting‚•πnvm it wont install
ugh
i need the iso
once urs finishes could u see if u can make an iso using the thingy‚•πwhat thingy‚•πu know that center app that allows u to make isos?‚•πMediaCreationTool?‚•πyea that‚•πyou can just download that
from the innernet
but it only makes stable isos‚•πah
i need the dev iso‚•πik there are websites that just pull the data from ms servers
like the windows update servers
that's how you make a Windows on Raspberry Pi image
in the meantime
i have to figure out
in which alternate universe
this
is equal to 24
windows 11 is slowww
either that or Lenovo Yoga Mode Control is taking 25% of my cpu or something
it no longer detects my fingerprint scanner‚•πred‚•πPls
Left center the taskbar‚•πnah
I prefer center aligned
that is
until there is not enough space left
then it looks really ugly
so ill probably keep it left aligned on my laptop
I'm connected to an external display rn‚•πmac‚•πum‚•πu know how like windows 10 was 21h1 or something‚•πoh that
um
i think its 21h2?
no 21h1 was the last windows 10 update
im not sure
i can check the settings app‚•πyea i need the version to install the iso‚•πif that helps‚•πah yea thanks
that works‚•πcool
go reminds me of c
like maybe here and there
but the majority of it is functional
rather than object oriented
go is very verbose
its also really easy to learn
because it cant do anything
so there is very little to learn
i swear this would be literally half as much code in python
but theres something ok about it
like
you just keep adding brackets and parentheses and types until the red lines go away
and when the red lines are gone
it kinda just works
unlike rust
where my variables get swallowed by the black hole that is ownership
go deals with all that pointer nonsense for me
like you just type something
and if it knows it needs to be a pointer it adds the &
or if it knows it needs to be dereferenced it just adds the *‚•πgo has a garbage collector‚•πik
mutex time
i think cyrchdb is ready
i am going to test it with my existing python crawl script
of course replacing all the mongodb queries with cyrchdb queries
of which there are only 3
read: get a url to search
complete: mark a url as searched, and mark whether or not it worked, as well as the status code returned
introduce: upsert urls into the database
hi my name is cyrchdb
where mongodb would be crashing your pc
i am using 2% CPU
when you think you got a good deal on a monitor
like it doesnt come out in the video
but even when im not moving windows around
the screen is flickering like theres no tomorrow‚•πcode
TO THE MOON
look it looks like a roket
isnt that cool‚•πyeah‚•πcy‚•πyou know whats not cool‚•πdo you know what language this is‚•πmy monitor‚•πwindows 11‚•πlol‚•πah
I had a monitor that had orange corners
I replaced it
sad since it costed so much‚•πlol‚•πi mean I still have it
i dont throw out computer things‚•πthe monitor i have was $100
i was like‚•πmine was
um
400
when I was an 8th grader suffering from chuunibyou‚•πlol
my HP monitor was $100 and my Dell monitor was $200
despite being the same spec-wise
but the HP looks like it was designed at some ODM in China and it fails‚•πI have two lg monitors
and a graphics tablet thats also a monitor
idk how much they costed tho lol‚•πlol
i want a high res monitor
that runs at higher than 100% scale‚•πthat monitor that was 400 dollars
was 4k‚•πidk it would take way too long to convince my parents to buy me another monitor‚•πlol
how many are you at rn‚•π2
although
i have all the 4H monitors
so technically...
i could...
and i have like 2 or 3 DVI ports on my GPU‚•πI have a bunch of monitors lying around like that‚•πlol‚•πalso you never guessed what programming language that was‚•πlet me try and guess
is it ruby?‚•πno‚•πwhat is it‚•πdo you want more code‚•πi mean sure
im not sure‚•πtake a few more guesses‚•πam i allowed to use the internet
its probably some language i dont know
so imma look up languages on the internet‚•πyes‚•πelixir‚•πyes‚•πi looked it up on my flickering monitor
good thing i dont have epilepsy
or i would be literally dying right now‚•πlol
I might have epilepsy
maybe
probably not very severely though‚•πthe problem is that this is the second time this monitor has done this
and its worse this time
see i thought it might be my GPU
or my HDMI cable‚•πrma?‚•πcuz i use really sketchy HDMI cables
?
Return merchandise authorization‚•πidk what it stands for
yes‚•πlike file a return‚•πpeople use it like
yea
no
RMA is like when you return it to get it repaired or whatever
idk thats what ive seen on the internet‚•πI could do that
is how interested I am in calling HP‚•πwell
how interested are you in your monitor not flickering‚•πinterested enough that i'll just wait
15 minutes
and it calms down
it did that last time
theres probably some failing decoupling capacitor or something
i could open it
and find the problem
but if its a decoupling capacitor
the chances that i find it are approximately 0‚•πlol
you could RMA it‚•πidk
ill ask my dad tmrw
he bought the monitor
see cyrchdb is getting stuck
because it can't deal with URLs longer than 1000 characters
and then it hit one
and then it got stuck
well
this is the new code
but you can see what was happening before‚•πum
i cant read go
actually I can I tried to learn it
never used it tho‚•πlol that's like me with Rust‚•πlol I use rust
um‚•πgo is ok‚•πI can see‚•πits concurrency support is nice‚•πelixir is decent but like it has quirks
have fun
elixir's concurrency is really good‚•πhow do you start a thread
in elixir
interesting
how do you signal between threads‚•πmessage queue
there's a mailbox
you can send and recieve messages‚•πwait
queues or mailboxes‚•πalso‚•πor both‚•πmailbox
everything uses processes/threads‚•πhow do you do mailboxes‚•πlike you open a file
let me look‚•πgo has channels‚•πrust does too
do mailboxes
so
with the data
and then match the data‚•πyeah go is pretty much that‚•πexcept on elixir
you can spawn thousands of processes
with no cost‚•πyeah the same thing with Go
supposedly
since they are not "threads"
they are "goroutines"‚•πelixir/erlang is known for their concurrency‚•πso is go‚•πso is rust‚•πin go to use channels
you do like‚•πah‚•πwhich is pretty nice‚•πwhat is select‚•πit lets a goroutine handle multiple queues
so in this example
this routine handles serial writing
so that you dont have 2 things writing at once
but there are 2 types of writes it can do
so select allows it to choose which one it is going to do based on which one needs to be done
its kind of like waiting for one of the channels to be populated‚•πah I see
you can just use two channels in rust‚•πyou can also specify a default
then if neither are populated
it will not block‚•πI see
I haven't messed that much with messages in concurrent applications‚•πgo also compiles really fast‚•πrust compiles really slowly‚•πand go deals nicely with nested anonymous functions and struct definitions
however it has too many types
for my liking
like‚•πare go structs like rust structs
since I like rust structs a lot‚•πi mean
they are just structs
and you can pass them into the Unmarshal function
to turn JSON into struct
like this‚•πrust
serde does this exact thing‚•πin this example
job stores the data
from the json
interesting
so it does the same thing
yeah in go you add those little strings at the end‚•πoh you can do custom fields too‚•πidk how they work‚•πmacros‚•π?‚•πlike if working is pulled from something else
like "bob" for some reason has the working status‚•π?‚•πlook
like
{ "index": 2, "working": false, "status": "broken beyond repair"}
now chagne to
{ "index": 2, "bob": false, "status": "broken beyond repair"}
you can make it interpret that into the former struct‚•πyeah
in go you can do that‚•πthat feature is underrated imo
the serialize/deserialize from structs
does python have it‚•πtbh idk
but the thing is
it would not be "pythonic"
ik typescript has this‚•πah‚•πbut it implements it in a fun way
where its not actually making any new structures
or something
idk
i dont use typescript
maybe i should
im currently watching 4 instances of python slowly die
one of them is still half alive
2 of them are dead
one is still dying
please dont ask me why they are dying
i have no clue‚•πtry elixir
it might not die
or get a better cpu
anyway
httpie is nice‚•πno im going to rewrite this part of cyrch in go
im rewriting all of cyrch in go
then i can say "written in Go"
like all those go hippies‚•πadd blue style accents to cyrch's branding‚•πyes‚•πhttpie is good‚•πis that for testing‚•πyes‚•πim using Insomina‚•πno i dont want to use postman or insomnia‚•πcalum was using it‚•πi know about both
i used to use insomnia‚•πbut ur a terminal frog
and it doesn't work in the terminal‚•πwhatever that means‚•πyou only exist in terminals
one instance of python is still throwing 200 nested exceptions‚•πexcellent
no
if you want‚•πwith supabase‚•πI'm using Mnesia‚•πi could try and write it in as few lines of code as possible‚•πthats what im trying to do‚•πi think i could get it under 200‚•πgood luck‚•πwith log in‚•πit is an API
not a website‚•πemotes?‚•πyes‚•πhow do you authenticate‚•πjwt
tokens‚•πhow do you issue such tokens‚•πthrough the api‚•πbut how do ppl create profiles‚•πthe admin creates them‚•πhmm
what if i made a web UI version of it
then i would not be able to get it under 200 lines
cuz i cant write a website in 200 lines
actually‚•πyou can‚•πnot true‚•πmake it a static site‚•πi can just
minify‚•πlol that doesnt count‚•πwhat counts then
if i use prettier‚•πhuman-readable commented code‚•πit can make anything 500 lines‚•πwrite emotes in 200 lines‚•π?‚•πyes
make it a static site
forget the api part‚•πwhy does that decrease the number of lines‚•πsince there is no code
except the one bash script
that resizes and throws the emotes in folders‚•πits basically emotes‚•πyou can‚•πbut cy edition
so its not the same
would you like to participate in the cyrch project‚•πno‚•πwhy‚•πim writing kode rn
and idk what your project entails‚•πyou just have to run a web crawler‚•πnah‚•πwhy not‚•πfind someone else‚•πlol‚•πbecause I said no‚•πwait
repl is a thing
th am i doing‚•πyes
see I knew you would come up with something smart‚•πlol
but it would be fun to have friends doing it
distributed cyrch‚•πdistributed jrunner5‚•πthat is a thing
except‚•πthat i dont even run
i should do that‚•πyeah
you should‚•πsince i wrote it
lol‚•πyeah‚•πi will
im building a new server soon‚•πyknow whats funny
its down rn
cuz heroku
itll be back up thursday
when Heroku gives me time back
i could host it on my vultr
since i can host playtools serverless‚•πyou could‚•πthe problem is
what if the server stops
how do i make it restart
and what if i wanna update it
i have to go and git pull‚•πssh over the new version‚•πwhereas with heroku
i just git push‚•πwith a tarball
you can probably write a bash script
that just updates it for you‚•πor
i could put my credit card in heroku
and then they will up me from 500 hours to 1000 hours per month
which is above the 750 hour requirement
for 100% uptime‚•πyes
I want to program this
so I will be disappear now
but you could do all these things‚•πok
imma keep listening to Valley on spotify
and maybe figure out why tf my python script keeps dying‚•πthis is how kode is soposed to look
also I j bought a bunch of rocket lab stock
well
to be rocket lab
ticker vacq
cuz they doin a merger
with rocketlab to go public
cuz they spac
I did that with spce
wich is vergin galatic
and I make many money‚•πif they go vacq
then i got vacq‚•πha
best stonk adviser‚•πikr
because they go for stonks
not stocks‚•πsee
i have only bought a little gme when that was a thing‚•πthis is what wsb does‚•πand sold, made a bit of monee
yuk‚•πyou should do day trading‚•πtaxes
say no
cuz short term capital gains
+ income tax
= not worth it‚•πWell
Only if ur wallstreet gang
Then u have to day trade‚•πye
i like to trade large-medium volume of stock within 1-2 years‚•πYea thats best‚•πso far it work out
so i am happy
lol, all my job money has gone to steam games and stock
i need to get a life‚•πAh yes
Thats how it goes
Also would ridge be considered an accredited institution by any definition?‚•πfalse‚•πUgh‚•πyea

and see if is intact‚•πWe believe in the Eternal God; Father, Son and Holy Spirit‚Äîthe One True God who created all things. We believe there is one God, eternally existent in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

We believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, born of a virgin by the Holy Spirit. Our Lord Jesus Christ is God and Man in one person. He lived a sinless life, performed miracles, and vicariously atoned for sin through His shed blood and death on the cross. We believe in the bodily resurrection, the Ascension into Heaven, and the imminent return of the Lord Jesus Christ.

We believe in the Bible, which is the inspired and infallible Word of God.

We believe in the essential spiritual need for all mankind to personally experience being born again of God and receiving eternal life.

We believe marriage has been established by God. This organization defines "marriage" as the exclusive covenantal union of one man and one woman in which such union is a lifetime commitment. A civil government's sanction of a union will be recognized as a legitimate marriage by this organization only to the extent that it is consistent with the definition of "marriage" found in these articles.

We believe in divine healing through Christ's atonement, appropriated through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.

We believe in the celebration of communion until Christ comes, and a believer's baptism by full immersion.

We believe the person and work of the Holy Spirit with His fruit and gifts abiding in the Church.

We believe regeneration by the Holy Spirit is absolutely essential for the salvation of lost and sinful men.

We believe the Holy Spirit indwells all believers and enables them to live a godly life.

We believe the baptism of the Holy Spirit and the gifts of the Spirit is given to all believers.

We believe eternal life is received by faith. That is, trusting in Jesus Christ alone for salvation and repentance of your sin.

We believe there is unity of all believers in our Lord Jesus Christ.

We believe the true church of the Lord Jesus Christ is made up of all born again believers who have turned from sin and name Jesus Christ as their personal Lord and Savior.

We believe Christ's church, His body, is expressed through local churches under the leadership of apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers.

We believe in the Rapture, the catching away of the Church as described in I Thessalonians 4:16-17.

We believe both the lost and the saved will be resurrected from the dead. They that are lost into the resurrection of eternal damnation, and they that are saved unto the resurrection of eternal life.‚•πmy web crawler is downloading every version of firefox
i thought i had already solved this problem
its time to write cyrchbot
the actual crawler
to replace this awful python script that parses html with regex
and dies whenever it feels like it
i have to choose a programming language to write cyrchbot in
i will not write it in python
python has concurrency issues
i could write it in go
i could also try elixir
since ramesh thinks its good
and has good concurrency
oo interesting‚•πelixir is good
also irb is similar to iex
and has similar features
but elixir good for scalability/currency‚•πwhat is erlang‚•πthing elixir is written in
erlang is just like a "worse' version‚•πso it is supposed to replace erlang‚•πkinda i guess

Nope
There r few titles in vr that i feel are worth
But at the moment its not really that great‚•πthe amount of freakin grass in this drone‚•πThats
A solid chunk‚•πim replacing the frame
with one that doesn't really fit
but its fine
cuz the old one didn't entirely fit either
and this new one is supposed to be stronger
and im supposed to be smarter
so its less likely to break
supposed to be‚•πSupposedly
We shall see
If it will survive‚•πyes
theres a broken shielded inductor on my fc
idk what it is for‚•πThats not good is it‚•πbut i see these broken all the time
i mean
the fc still boots up
and the vtx works
although i just realized one of the wires is really frayed‚•πThat should be fine‚•πi can put some tape
i think its just the coating‚•πU should get a bunch of heat thingies
The heat covers
The shrink coat
Whatever its called‚•πheatshrink‚•πYea that one‚•πi could
but i dont think i can put it on
since like
i need to slide it over the wire
and it is connected on both ends‚•πU could cut it in half and try that
But yea
Tape is the same thing‚•πthe problem is its such a tiny wire
idk first imma try to get all the grass off the board‚•πAlso happy july 4th‚•πyes
happy independence day‚•πI forgot it was today‚•πi cleaned off most of the grass
with this little tiny brush
that came with a Nikon camera i bought a while ago
and some alcohol
DAMMIT I PUT THE FDRHKUEJN BOARD IN BACKWARDS IT TOOK ME 25 MINUTES ASDLFKJHASLKFJHLSKJFH‚•πNice‚•πok i think its all back together now
and i dont think o broke anything
that only took
like
an hour and half
its not taking off
it just spins 90 degrees and trips the runaway takeoff protection
and disarms
i think the problem is that the motors are going in the wrong directions
so it is inversely compensating
and dying
yeah they appear to be going the opposite direction betaflight thinks they are going
so imma reverse them in betaflight
and see if it works
yeah it works now
it flies kinda weird tho
and it sounds different
maybe this is what it is supposed to sound like

when you have 7 expired certificates and somehow everything is still fine‚•πah yes
italy is now in the finals‚•πlol do u watch sports
cuz i dont‚•πoccasionally‚•πI dont watch sports
but I will google it‚•πnot funny
that was me
I said this
actually it is funny
but slightly privacy-invasive‚•πi have no idea who said that
or what it refers to‚•πI said it‚•πor why i care
no as like an outsider‚•πit refers to my college visit at the university of toronto
ah
it would be funny if like
you had two isolated messages "I hate" and "<something here>" and then it just by chance combines them‚•πlol‚•πyes
the option to get rid of any messsages made by me‚•πlol other than that
like to the frontend‚•πnothing
how about‚•πif you want
i can simply download all the messages again‚•πI do want
but then again‚•πand then process them
to include everything but you‚•πso
at least it's private
you could do that
I feel like it would only take a few pipes with a dataframe in Julia‚•πwhat is this‚•πit's‚Ä¶ complicated
let's just say I wanted to "analyse" some messages I got from some people
and then it turned into a very weird‚•πok but in what way‚•πmessage ratio and graph project
you know the one‚•πwhat does it do‚•πI showed the graph to you remember
in comp sci club or something
once‚•πthat was messages/day‚•πyeah‚•πis that all it does?‚•πno it also has some message ratio stuff
and then‚•πwdym message ratio‚•πlike how much you send vs how much they send
not in words‚•πok...‚•πsince i
text
like
this
wait words could work
yeah I think I used words
not messages‚•πwhy is this interesting tho
its like
3 lines of python‚•πquantify
it's not that many lines in Julia either
I just wanted to learn julia
also it has a feature to combine
message histories across different platforms
into one html file
so you can read your entire chat history with this person‚•πinteresting‚•πyes
it is meaningful to me
now I must add hangouts support since I used that for a long time
for um
reasons‚•πlol‚•πI must depart now though
so bye‚•πbye‚•πOooo‚•πinteresting
i like joe biden
he cares about the same issues i care about
like right to repair‚•πYea‚•πand producing lithium batteries and solar panels in the US‚•πIf it goes through
Imma be intrested to see how hospitals and farmers respond
Those r the most intresting
Mechanics as well‚•πyeah
i have completed about 30% filantial niteracy work‚•πyeah I'll also like it
apparently the UK law, according to reddit, had right-to-repair for everything but phones and computers
but it's reddit so idk anything
it was a headline‚•πYea believe so‚•πegg-celent‚•πPhones and computers r kinda low on that list imo
They dont really need it compared to other stuff‚•πhi im a farmer
i lost half my yield
bc my tractor broke
and i had to send it to john deere‚•πand john deere took too long to fix it
hi im a person‚•πWasnt it not too long‚•πI lost my life chat history with my wife‚•πhi im dead‚•πBut how expensive it was‚•πbecause my phone broke‚•πbc my ventilator broke‚•πand apple wiped all the data from my iphone‚•πAww heck yea‚•πand im devastated
that was the only place I had pictures of my newborn baby
also it had important stuff for the divorce proceedings‚•πbut before my phone was wiped
the repair guy downloaded my sex photos‚•πApple: ‚Äúshouldve used icloud‚Äù‚•πand posted them online‚•πand I used signal so I can't get them back
since I have the one wife in a million that would use signal
and not imessage‚•πHaha‚•πlol‚•πlol i want that wife‚•πWell itll be interesting to see how it goes‚•πramesh has his future planned out‚•πyeah you think‚•πi need to do financial literacy
if i dont do it‚•πI shall now write the Hangouts module of my message analyser‚•πgo do that
and dont talk to me
for another 4 hours‚•πHow‚•πcensorship is not nice cy
unless I missed the how getting deleted‚•πi was fixing computers for 4 hours‚•πThat was me deleting it‚•πhaha‚•πStill
I finished everything yesterday
Just had to make a resume‚•πTHERES LIKE 6 FFERWEDAS ASSIGNMENTS‚•πYup‚•πi have not done the resume yet

i still have the reflective component‚•πI spent Up to 3 hours every day 7 days a week on fin lit
Oof‚•πsmh‚•πTry to spread it out
Don't cram‚•πidk
ill just assembly line it‚•πMy suggestion
It's mentally draining‚•πlol its physically draining

Yeah gl
And cy do some every day don't cram
My personal suggestion
I did it last year
Pain
But 1-3 hours per day every day will help you set a routine
Just a steady grind‚•πim not working on this for 1-3 hours every day
id rather rush it all in one night
in like 4-5 hours‚•πOh
Well we're different ppl‚•π4-5 hours of focused rushing financial literacy assignments
lol you probably actually try‚•πI like to have a routine
Oh no
That's the thing‚•πi basically do the minimum‚•πI do as little as I can
Yeah same
So I do more 2 hours than 3
And also I try to find some fun in it‚•πidk ive been working on this since like 6pm‚•πSo I do some every day‚•πidk‚•πAh
Idk‚•πi think imma alternate‚•πIf it works!‚•π1 day of summer reading
1 day of financial lit‚•πOr do weekdays
Summer reading isn't too bad‚•πidk i have trouble with it‚•πJust do 30 min every day
That's what I try to do
It eorks
Works‚•πi was gonna do that but then like
somehow it just doesn't happen
idk‚•πLook
1-3 hours of fin lit and 30 min of reading
That's like your morning‚•πlol i wake up at 11‚•πAssuming you wake up at 8 or 9
And then you have the rest of the day to do whatever
Oh
Nvm then‚•πideally I work until around 2 or 3 AM‚•πWell then that's your late night grind‚•πso ideally i do the financial lit one day before its due
yeah‚•πLol‚•πits like math practice
sometimes
i just like
do math practice‚•πK gl and have fun!‚•πuntil 1 or 2 am‚•πImma sleep hehehee

Never underestimate a Cy‚•πit is broken
finish a test
and then you will find it will load the exact same thing again
nvm it fixed itself‚•π???
Lol
I am not at home‚•πI think it was because I was two spaces ahead
so idk‚•πSo I can't test stuff‚•πk‚•πIf you find a problem please make a GitHub issue‚•πthere's a github
TIL
okay I will do that‚•πWhat does this mean‚•πtoday I learned
your licenses are nonfree btw‚•πIk
Not all of them
1:1 is‚•πyeah I know‚•πIf you want you can add a GitHub link to the site and make a PR
I need to learn more about PRs‚•πdef made for a reason
also im doing ap personal finance instead of fin lit
over the summer
cuz I was gonna do it
but then stevens precollege program rolled around
so I was like, well we dont hav da time for de tests
ap personal finance time‚•πAre you guarenteed into the course?‚•πlol I hope
if not I will j take it senior year‚•πAs an elective?
Ah that's smart‚•πis this the point where I flex on you all for taking it in person the first semester of 10th grade
so I literally don't have to deal with any of this lol haha funny
I mean ap econ also counts
wait‚•πUntil the 2021-2022 school year
After that no‚•πye I am the last one‚•πaw
that's sad
quite the unfortunate thing‚•πi mean, i am not allowed to touch machines but what about the ones that you make
test 1, mixed results
it burned for a bit
but then did not
so i need a better ignition system‚•πinteresting‚•πno thrust
but
3d printed engines can hold up to some heat of combustion
cuz like that part that is kinda dying was ment to kinda die‚•πthat is interesting
i thought it would melt
like the whole thing‚•πi did a mico recipie
wich has insulator
of fire scelent thing
in the middle
so it no melto‚•πcool‚•πand the part with no scelent
no melt
but
mico math check out
cuz i got some combustion
this is what happens when u change ur windows font‚•πlol
remember this
hmm
im not so sure about netlifyCMS
its gonna cause some platform lockin‚•πIntresting
Welp i just got internet
So we back in business‚•πüëç
im currently looking up tutorials on how to use netlifycms with vercel
so I can see how hard it is
not easy
you have to like
run a git gateway
and some auth thing
and a lot of the tutorials say to use their software or plugins
which only work with vercel
so that doesn't help
so...
umm...
idk its not the end of the world ill just use netlify
the only reason I dont wanna use netlify is that they have limits
on transfer
and build minutes
and I think vercel builds faster
but
now that I think about it
i could technically just host my site on both netlify and vercel
and use the netlify one for netlifycms
netlifycms is too finnicky
and the UI is weird
i think ill just be my own cms for now
Gatsby is driving me nuts
i thought i was done with this react nonsense
i think imma just use sveltekit
why is the most generic thing so complicated
as far as I understand sveltekit has a plugin for prerendering
and it works
when you define a variable BUT NO ITS NOT ACTUALLY A VARIABLE
someone please help the sass compiler‚•πDont u need like ${background} or something‚•πdidn't need it in a different file
there.
you can no longer complain about my blog.‚•πdo you think we should pull out of afghanistan‚•πidk
im working on my blog
my favorite thing about Gatsby is when the development server gives a different result from the production build
like
the development build will work perfectly
but when you build
the build will literally appear, then self destruct within about 250ms
because the ssr worked, but the hydration failed
so your user sees your site for a split second
then it all disappears
and when you go to the console to see the error
its some minified crap
this is quantum computing
we are 2 themes at once
Gatsby's static rendering is broken
its funny cuz that's literally the point of gatsby
welp
lets just disable it for this page
yawn
netlify takes about 2x as long to build compared to vercel
and from my 1 day of experience
it completely fails about 10% of the time
although that's probably a me issue‚•πdude the one thing that joe bidome did right‚•πCool
Time to see what happens‚•πI spend money‚•πgot imessage working on the surface hackintosh‚•πcool‚•πItaly won
How
What is this turn of events
Whats that?‚•πoh youll see
its related to this‚•πAh i see‚•πthis should only take me a little less than 2 hours
im doing it on the Wikipedia page for "Computer"‚•πYea i can imagine itll take a while to record each word‚•πwell ive automated it pretty good‚•πTrue‚•πjust press space
say the word
press space
and another one comes up
and repeat
theres a python flask server dealing with actually logging and organizing the audio data
so I must go
and continue this process
*sigh‚•πNice
Have fun
Hahaha
Good luck saying that‚•πlol‚•πI need to get authelia to work‚•πgo do that‚•πYes‚•πimma try and pronounce this‚•πBut to do that i need to set up recursive dns with pihole
Which is a pain
On top of a pain
Gl‚•πI swear imma become like that guy who knows how to pronounce everything‚•πOh yea‚•πaisujdfpüò∞iasdfp‚•πU should add a thing
Where it adds the pronounication‚•πmeh
no one ever uses that word
ill just try pronouncing it
1/6 of the way there‚•πNice one‚•π1/3 of the way there
and I swear
i hasn't given me the word "of"‚•πSurprising‚•πgive me a sentence‚•πI like pie, and pie likes me‚•πdoesn't have i‚•π?‚•πit doesn't have the word "i"‚•πI‚•πsomething it can say:

Cause ur speed of speaking varies‚•πyeah‚•πWhich one looks better‚•πthe second one‚•πIts nice looking
But its kinda dramatic‚•πfor ur hash compression

She typed in her username and password, but instead of bringing up her account, a new web page came up. It told Mei-Li all her money would be lost unless she typed in her Social Security number, her mother‚Äôs maiden name, and her date of birth. No way!

Thats the only way it can find text in an image/ocr‚•πie8 says no‚•πcan I do sql attacks
but on the main database‚•π?‚•πima take that as a yes‚•πi mean

At the state level, taxes primarily go to education and healthcare. A lot of this is at the K-12 level, as they fund the public schools in their entirety (except for summer financial literacy which is an extra $300 oops). More than $316 billion dollars goes to public schools each year (clearly none of which was able to be spent on improving the summer financial literary course).‚•πyes
u should include it‚•πu mean communism

they may have removed it
hold on‚•πi believe they did
cause the option is not there‚•πwhat worries me a little
is that like
there is literally no option
at all
even for me
so its permanently on for me‚•πyea its annoying‚•πso if i ever have to use a school chromebook
without my phone on me
im pretty much screwed‚•πi accidentally had my student id on a github project‚•πlol
you know your student ID is unaccidentally in the URL of genesis‚•πyea
thats what happened‚•πlol‚•πits gone now but still
why tf is it in clear text‚•πworking on my blog
adding background images
imma also add cover videos‚•πoh nice‚•πso i can feature a YouTube video
before the whole article‚•πim still pissed off why its just there in genesis‚•πCUZ ITS YOUR STUDENT ID
ITS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE UR PASSWORD‚•πtell that to the school‚•πlol we should
we should get together
and tell the school
but like
literally no one cares
but like
5 ppl
you, me, and 3 other random ppl‚•πtrue
but i still want 2fa
that much they should give us‚•πtbh im fine with no 2fa
as long as i can change my password‚•πtrue
idk it is my google account for school so idrc that much
but imma go through a security purge and make new passwords‚•πfrom youtube
theres 4h

I join‚•πkool

theres like just michael‚•πdoes anyone here want free music software
bitwig studio 4.0‚•πim upping my illegal web crawling game
imma do a fun project
you paste a link to any site with song lyrics on it
and the software will scrape the lyrics from the page
using AI
the idea is you can do this for any page
or any service
and in principle be able to do this for any type of data you are trying to scrape
yes
like that‚•πEasy one to start‚•πbut first I have to figure out how to use AI
i just connected a GPU to my google colab instance
and its like
5x faster‚•πWhat do you use google colab for‚•πim using it to run the google tensorflow examples
someone gimme a list of songs
like 10-20
ideally more popular songs
ok so i have now successfully generated about 20k strings that are either part of song lyrics or not part of song lyrics
TF is happening in europe
this building is burning and flooding at the same freakin time
tensorflow doesn't support AMD gpus
which is sad
because
i have an amd gpu
and im impatient
and keras is taking forever to train
lol i wonder why *cough 17.7k samples‚•πROCm‚•π?‚•πROCm is worse cuda for amd‚•πinteresting
my model has 90% accuracy
which is kinda trash
lol kinda like grades in basking ridge
my ai sorta works
it misses about half the lyrics
but‚•πbut this‚•πlol
see my ai never picks up anything that is not a lyric
so as long as it finds something close to the first lyric
which is almost always does
and something close to the last lyric
which is kinda does
i can just pull everything in between
ok actually i retrained it with randomized data
and its like
way better this time
gimme a song
or the link to the lyrics of said song
on any website‚•πuh
sure‚•πi need the link to the lyrics
i could just google it
but like
knowing you
there are no lyrics
um‚•πlisten to it for a second
uh
how about
"wake me up" by avicii‚•πok lemme try that
raw lyric snippet
if i implemented that thing from before
[Verse 1]
Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me

[Chorus]
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't knowÔªø I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know ÔªøI was lost

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
I hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a gameÔªø made for everyone
And love is the prize

[Chorus]
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't knowÔªø I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost

[Outro]
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
if i was smart about implementing it
so generally it works
this is by far the most overengineered web scraper i have ever made
but i have to say
it works
the only thing is its not one nice program
its 3 programs right now
the first is to google search the link to the song lyrics, written in python
the second is to scrape the page with puppeteer, written in nodejs
the third to run the keras model, written in python
the current issue with this whole thing is that keras only works in python
and puppeteer only works in nodejs
*yawn
im going to bed‚•πDude
U should go to bed way earlier‚•πI mean I go to bed around 11-12‚•πjust got back from the beach
its machine learning time‚•πI am a shepord for children cuz I am helping run a camp for deb8

i gtg take care of children
bye‚•πhave fun‚•πi am saying my prayers‚•πahsdfjalsdfkhalsdkfjah keras is not working
its just hanging
cy added contextual reasoning to his ai web scraper
it now examines not only the current line, but also the previous line and the next line
which appears to have improved overall accuracy from 95% to about 99%
but has reduced false negatives from about 55% to about 25%
hi my name is tensorflow
i can make cool text vectorization based models
AND I CANT FREAKING SAVE THEM
kajhsd;lkjhfal;sdkjfhlakjsdhf
i need to install the "nightly" version
and it wont install
aasdasfsdfasdfaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
dealing with tensorflow feels like trying to install custom roms on an AT&T locked phone
its not completely impossible
but...
would you like to know what line caused that error?
I want to use wsl
but wsl wont load
it downright refuses
docker?
requires wsl
a vm?
im not using a vm
actual linux?
*yawn
when pip wont uninstall ur modules‚•πUsing python? üòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉ‚•πyes
python is usually not this bad
oops uninstalled pip
um
*cough
GODDAMIT
IT DOESNT SUPPORT PYTHON 3.9
AL:KDFJHALSKJDFHLAKSJDHLASKJDHLAKSJDH
THATS WHY ITS NOT WORKING
tensorflow and I are having some tension
its ok
we can work this out
alrighty take 8 or whatever
lol nvm
there will be no tensorflow js
tensorflow is crap
its so inconsistent
but on the bright side
pyppeteer appears to be working
hi my name is tensorflow
saving a model does not always do the same thing
sometimes...
i will just save a bunch of corrupted nonsense
other times...
ill save just fine
*yawn
lol and I thought I was up late
i need to clean my keyboard
i think imma do that
i have to remove all the keys
the documentation is in chinese
I DID NOT ASK FOR THE DOCUMENTATION TO BE IN CHINESE
ohmygod why is this so difficult
I GOT COPILOT‚•πOh cool
Looks pretty good
Was that what u were gonna type?
Welcome to ai‚•πtbh im not sure
but the rest of the lines were
this is 100% what i am aiming to accomplish with this function
thanks copilot :)
imagine taking 12 seconds to reach a 30 second timeout after 60 seconds
huh
so you can't run a headless chromium rendering runtime and a tensorflow machine learning model on 256mb of ram in a docker container
its actually not bad this copilot thing
in certain cases
ok this is actually pretty cool
whats fun is that it even understands what is a client error and what is a server error‚•πAP scores are out‚•πDude
I bs‚Äôd an entire subjects ap test
Like went in without knowing anything
Took the test
Wrote random stuff
Chose random mc
Got a 5
The one i try on i score less on‚•πWhat scores did u gets
On apush‚•π4
So pretty good‚•πah I got a 4 too
on ap sem‚•πyea it wasnt bad
now i gotta do fin lit‚•πapparently tho if you look at the percentages‚•πwas the curve massive?‚•πidk
for ap sem 11% of ppl get 5
about the same for US history
wait
no that's an unofficial website
on the official website
6.4% of ppl get a 5 on ap sem
13% of ppl get a 5 on ap us
and lol‚•πyea it was low this year‚•π25% of ppl get 5 on apcs‚•πwell that doesnt really matter
those r nation wide statistics
im more curious about ridge as a whole‚•πhow do you find local statistics‚•πu cant
only ap teachers have that information‚•πinteresting‚•πwait
i wanna see the nation stats on aphug
the percentage must be very high‚•πSherice got a 5 in sem‚•πtrevor packer said that
every score's performance went down
except hug
hug people improved on and did better‚•πhaha‚•πalso anyone here dont ask what I got I absolutely inted the entire AP thing‚•πlol did cy get a 5 in comp sci
u better hav‚•πno I 1200% did not get a 5 in comp sci‚•πreally
fuck‚•πi got a 5‚•πthen I failed
lol‚•π25% of ppl do
nationally‚•πi thought u were serious
i haven't checked my skores‚•πcheckem‚•πcuz i am at the deb8 camp
for liitle kids‚•πon cell phone‚•πI dont trust fone sekurity
ima b home in in hour anyways
so I will check then‚•πok‚•πi am nervous
cuz i need a 5
i mean i could still get a 4 an b fine
but like
5 = best
cuz ap scores are now worth more
cuz collages r taking away the sat‚•πi got a 4 in sem‚•πis that actually true‚•πshould i intern at replit‚•πif they have any positions open and they accept high schoolers sure
its a good experience‚•πyou have to do this whole complicated thing
im trying to find companies i could intern at
i think they do
the hell
ohmygod since when is it ok to assign FOUR FREAKING SIMULATORS for one assignment
like
i get it was assigned a little while ago
smh
idk‚•πidk
i finished em all
was pretty quick‚•πim on #2
uh oh
wherd all the banks go
did they all fail?
were they FDIC insured?
windows 356 is a thing
its basically stadia
but for windows
you can get cloud vms
and stream them to any device
i could see this being kinda interesting
like
if you need to do some video editing
but u have a crappy laptop from 5 years ago
you can just provision a vm with a fancy cpu and gpu
do ur video editing
and then terminate the vm
when ur done‚•πI got 5 on apcs exam, I forgot to tell last night‚•πKnife transparent?‚•πHmm?
No its just a shiny metal one
The way its reflecting tho is crazy cool‚•πyea
i bought 2 amzn for financial lit
imma also buy some spotify
dunno why
should i buy more lithium americas‚•πI too got a 5‚•πYes I have many of that stock
Buy VACQ
And sedg
And spce
Among others‚•πwhen google's free cloud service is 6x faster than ur pc
lol actually more like 10x‚•πHuh‚•πyeah
colab
they giv free gpu‚•πWell yea if ur using tensorflow and collab
Itll work nicer‚•πthe thing is
i wanna train models for long time
and im pretty sure colab has time limits
i have a gpu
but its amd
and i dont wanna try and use amd's thing‚•πUm i think it does but u can like script start and stop it mabye
Yes idk
I wanna train a chatbot/teach it english‚•πi also "have" a gtx 1050ti
that would be cool
wanna work on it with me?‚•πWhy have in quotations
Um sure‚•πits on my family computer‚•πEh just snag it‚•πmy brother will get mad‚•πMake him not mad‚•πlol
he literally watches YouTube and plays Minecraft and brawl stars
and among us sometimes
like
just use the iGPU‚•πYea that would be more than enough
Idk i have a gtx 710 so its outdated
But i can run models for like weeks at a time‚•πtbh
my cpu would probably be better than a gtx 710‚•πProbably
My cpu would be better than a gtx 710
But u need a gpu sometimes‚•πi dont think so‚•πWell it depends on which cpus
My i7 idk mabye
My xeons probably‚•πi think tensorflow works cpu only
but like
it just gets hella slow‚•πHmm
Idk but i am gonna try training a bot to speak english‚•πit trained all 150 epochs in like 90 seconds
yeah that
um‚•πThats pretty good‚•πrn im training a model
and like
1 epoch is taking 4 minutes
im on 3 of 20‚•πThats not terrible‚•πnot that terrible, but like
for something usable
you need like 50-100 epochs
probably‚•πItll be done in like 40 minutes or so
Yea‚•πofc this is not training on text messages
this is training on Shakespeare‚•πYea‚•πhey you know we actually have a lot of training data for a chat bot
..‚•πYea‚•πthis would be an interesting project
we could make a telegram bot
that like
actually talks‚•πYup
That would be cool
Ideally its an api‚•πhave u ever tried machine learning‚•πI used to use it‚•πfor what‚•πThen i stopped cause it pissed me off‚•πlol
um
i can relate‚•πUm the simple example projects
Like cats vs dogs‚•πyeah
i did some ml for my dad
that was the first thing i did
we classified images of fiber speckle patterns
now im doing more nlp
natural language processing
so the ai-lyrics/AnyLyrics thing‚•πYup ik
I wanted to use nltk for some discord bot‚•πwhat is tk‚•πBut u had to define grammar rules
And i didnt want to do that‚•πthe nlp Shakespeare example im running rn is character based‚•πNatural language toolkit‚•πit doesnt even have to be in english
it learns english
my model is currently learning Shakespearean english
what is that
is that like tensorflow?‚•πNot really
It works with language processing‚•πinteresting‚•πIts statistics based‚•πwebsite?‚•πUh its a library
U can just look it up‚•πinteresting
it would be more fun probably tho to make a model that uses machine learning
with tensorflow‚•πYeah‚•πhmm‚•πYea ill prob start once i get my servers back up and stuff
I havent unpacked my boxes still
